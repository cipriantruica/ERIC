"Stage Door: <i>The Elephant Man, Lost Lake</i>"	"<img alt= 2014-12-13-HuffpoEM.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HuffpoEM-thumb.jpg  width= 290  height= 250  style = float: left; margin:10px ><br /> <br /> <b><i>The Elephant Man</i></b> is back on Broadway -- thanks to Bradley Cooper, the Hollywood hunk who demonstrates the theatrical chops to portray the deformed Englishman John Merrick. In Victorian times, Merrick, covered with tumors and billed as  half man, half elephant,  was cruelly exhibited in sideshows until the kindly prominent Dr. Treves rescued him.<br /> <br /> Treves (Alessandro Nivola), who initially wants to study Merrick, doubles as his protector. Thanks to the generosity of the London public, he secures him a permanent home in the hospital. <br /> <br /> Now at the Booth Theater, <i>The Elephant Man</i>, which won the Tony for Best Play in 1979, is effective because it isn't literal. Cooper doesn't wear a prosthetic; instead, the audience imagines his disfigurement as he contorts his body. And people gasp in horror at the sight of him.<br /> <br /> It's a successful conceit. Cooper holds himself in a punishing pose, his mouth terribly twisted, as he struggles to speak. Mrs. Kendal (Patricia Clarkson), a famed actress, discovers his romantic and sensitive nature. She introduces him to the upper crust, which also comes to gaze, albeit in a more civilized and friendly fashion. Indeed, be it lord or lady, all find the best elements of themselves in Merrick. <br /> <br /> And that's playwright Bernard Pomerance's larger point. Merrick may be grotesque on the outside, but his affliction hides a caring, truthful soul. Victorian society, with its workhouses and freak shows, is ruled by rigid mores and social propriety. <i>The Elephant Man</i> carefully unmasks its prim hypocrisy, but stops short of digging too deeply, which would only enhance the text.<br /> <br /> Still, it's a thoughtful work, brought to fruition by Cooper's riveting, heart-wrenching performance. He expresses a myriad of emotions, revealing the dignity and intellect of a man whose interior life is as rich as his exterior is hideous. Clarkson's performance is beautifully calibrated, whether she's discussing <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> or, in a crucial scene, offering Merrick his first look at a woman. <br /> <br /> Nivola delivers a subtle and wonderful turn. His Dr. Treves has an initial arrogance, but as he realizes the enormity of Merrick's spirit, his own vulnerabilities are revealed. This is as much Treves' story as Merrick's, delivered by a top-notch cast and capable ensemble, led by Anthony Heald, Henry Stram and Scott Lowell.<br /> <br /> Director Scott Ellis keeps the pace moving. He relies on a minimal set design to focus attention on the story. In our era, when wealth is grossly exploitative and political indifference trumps social compassion, <i>The Elephant Man</i> offers a mirror on our own humanity.<br /> <br /> <b><i>Lost Lake</i></b>, now at City Center, is written by David Auburn, who won a Tony in 2001 for his masterwork <i>Proof</i>. The lofty themes of <i>Proof</i> mined the nature of reality, both mathematical and personal.<br /> <br /> Conversely, <i>Lost Lake</i> is a quieter effort. Veronica (Tracie Thoms) travels from Manhattan to upstate New York to rent a shabby rustic house for a week. Hogan (John Hawkes), the down-on-his-luck owner, promises much, but rarely delivers. His good intentions are marred by his limitations.<br /> <br /> Veronica is polite but distant; she just wants a pleasant vacation for her children. Yet during the week, the two swap tales of unhappiness. Succor, they find, can come from the most unlikely quarter. They aren't friends; care is mitigated by circumstance. <br />  <br /> With his gangly air, Hawkes is spot-on in his ability to project a weird but well-meaning concern. Thoms nicely captures what happens to the responsible when life veers off-course. <i>Lost Lake</i> is a reminder of the quiet desperation that lurks above and below the surface. Neither its characters nor story is memorable, but its message, the possibility of the kindness of strangers, resonates.<br /> <br /> <i>Photo: Joan Marcus</i> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 17:26:22 -0500"	"arts"
"New J.K. Rowling Story Reveals The History Of The Leaky Cauldron"	"J.K. Rowling posted a new riddle on Harry Potter fan site Pottermore today -- part of a 12-day series during which new writings and magical tidbits will be released as the ultimate Christmas gift for wizard-loving muggles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Here's today's quiz:</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt= pottermore  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388746/thumbs/o-POTTERMORE-570.jpg?2  /><br /> <br /> The answer, as Hogwarts fanatics know, is Diagon Alley, the bustling street where Harry first picks up his school supplies and wand. Rowling rewarded those who responded correctly with further details about the Leaky Cauldron, the famous pub that serves as a gateway to Diagon Alley, including the names of a few of its former owners. <br /> <br /> Today's prize was a two-for-one: Rowling also shared an anecdote about Florean Fortescue, a Diagon ice cream shop owner who was originally slated to play a bigger part in the Harry Potter series. <br /> <br /> While some fans delight in such details, others think that Rowling let readers take over the Potter narrative <a href= http://thoughtcatalog.com/nico-lang/2013/09/why-j-k-rowling-needs-to-let-harry-potter-go/  target= _hplink >rather than meddling with the concluded plot</a>.<br /> <br /> If you're in the first camp, check out these stories J.K.

"Jeffrey Marsh, Vine Star, Discusses Their Work As An Activist"	"<strong>Editor's Note</strong>: <em>Jeffrey Marsh is open to the use of any pronoun but for the purposes of this profile, we are using  they/them/their. </em><br /> <br /> You may not know who they are -- but you've no doubt heard their message.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://jeffreymarsh.com/  target= _hplink >Jeffrey Marsh</a> is a social media star who <a href= http://vine.co/jeffreymarsh  target= _hplink >utilizes Vine</a> to spread messages of positivity and awareness on a massive digital platform. Their Vines have collectively received more than 90 million views, ultimately providing Marsh with the opportunity to take their message outside of social media and speak and perform all over New York City.<br /> <br /> Marsh is most notably known for spearheading the viral hashtags #DontSayThatsSoGay and #NoTimetoHateMyself.<br /> <br /> In the technological age, the face of activism has evolved along with the way in which we communicate. Marsh is part of a generation of LGBTQ activists who, through social media, are changing minds and perceptions in parts of the world where people may not encounter a queer person in their day to day lives.<br /> <br /> The Huffington Post chatted with Marsh this week about their work as an activist, the way in which they utilize social media and what they have planned for the future.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Huffington Post: How did you become a Vine star? </strong><br /> <a href= http://jeffreymarsh.com/  target= _hplink >Jeffrey Marsh</a>: By accident! I'm doing what I always did: dress up like Julie Andrews, dance around, tell people they're awesome as heck, sing them songs and (literally) kick up my heels to some catchy Katy Perry.<br />  <br /> The only difference now is the camera, the chance to post those moments for gay kids in Arkansas and Canadian moms. No other form of social media I've tried allows me to immediately connect like Vine does. It is very much like a face-to-face social experience. Each day I'm shocked and excited to find messages from people who feel like my videos help them to be themselves. I guess I became a  star  by being myself. <br /> <br /> <strong>When did you realize that things were really heating up and people were starting to take notice?</strong><br /> That's the funny thing, it was so gradual -- so natural. There are plenty of people in social media who burn brightly and fast, who go viral and get (almost) instant fame. For whatever reason, my journey so far has been consistent and incremental. I picture one friend telling another; a grass roots approach to fame. <br /> <br /> It would be hard to argue that my message isn't popular. But is it the most popular? Not by a long shot. I'm reminded of Joan Rivers talking about some advice she once got: if 0.1% of America thinks you're funny, you'll fill stadiums for the rest of your life. I'm not sure I will ever fill a stadium, but I think Joan and I are both talking about quality over quantity. This is most true when it comes to cultivating a relationship with the like-minded people who call themselves fans. And I'm happy to say that those fans are all over the figurative (and literal) map: old, young, black, white, trans, bi -- you name it! Everybody is welcome and can hopefully connect with my inclusive message. <br /> <br /> <img alt= jeffrey marsh  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2382524/thumbs/o-JEFFREY-MARSH-570.jpg?8  /><br /> <br /> <strong>Did you have a strategy or a plan in the beginning or were you just creating Vines that felt right to you and putting them out in the world?</strong><br /> Did I have a plan? Definitely not! I always knew I wanted to tell as many people (in as many ways as I could) that there is nothing wrong with them. I just started posting things that brought a smile to my face, that helped me feel excited to post again -- to connect again. <br /> <br /> I don't like dwelling on the  larger  implications of what I'm doing. There have been hundreds of messages from people who decided not to commit suicide because of my channel, for instance. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that's happening! It's just that all I did was look into my iPhone camera and tell a friend they're beautiful for being alive. I don't ever want to lose that connection. Is that simple direct approach a strategy? Maybe it is…<br /> <br /> <iframe class= vine-embed  src= https://vine.co/v/OvjBaZ7Jde1/embed/simple  width= 570  height= 600  frameborder= 0 ></iframe><script async src= //platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js  charset= utf-8 ></script><br /> <br /> <strong>Do you approach your vines differently now than you did at the beginning? What has changed for you?</strong><br /> Maybe part of my success, and the success of Vine overall, is the relatability factor. People can see me; they can look into my eyes, which never happens on Twitter. I've shied away from making more polished,  produced  vines because I'm concerned they will lose a personal touch -- a humanity that is so essential to one of my missions: showing that LGBTQ folks are just folks. We are all human.<br /> <br /> One thing that has changed for me is the recognition of the responsibility I have. I say it in a grandiose way because I don't think I'm representing just LGBTQ folks. I've realized recently that my gender identity is a metaphor. I have the chance to be a voice for many of the voiceless outsiders in the world -- the heartbroken people who have felt left out. If my interactions on Vine are any indication, there are a lot of us out there!<br /> <br /> <strong>What’s it like to see a hashtag campaign you’ve created take off and touch so many people?</strong><br /> It's ultra-fulfilling and fun. To know that people benefit, to know that people get it and are changed by what I do is a reason to get up in the morning. It's also a reason to glue on false lashes when I'm a little tired and skim through hate e-mail to answer my followers. #DontSayThatsSoGay and #NoTimetoHateMyself brought out so many different kinds of people; people who would never be in front of a camera, never would be that visible on social media. They felt the message, their participation was that important. And everyone's participation is that important! It really excites me to see that. Being in front of the camera feels natural for me, but when someone else who might be nervous or shy puts their truth on Vine, it is very inspirational. <br /> <br /> <blockquote class= twitter-tweet  lang= en ><p><a href= https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dontsaythatssogay?src=hash >#Dontsaythatssogay</a> <a href= https://twitter.com/JeffreyMarsh >@jeffreymarsh</a> I am gay.

That's what's important: the connection, the changed lives. I often feel like my life has been changed most of all.<br /> <br /> <strong>When it comes to gender identity and sexual orientation, how would you describe yourself?</strong><br /> I never want anyone to feel bad. Ever. So, I decided a while ago that there is no  wrong way  to refer to me. I know that words and pronouns are really important to a lot of people. I respect that deeply. Several times a week, people ask  what's your preferred pronoun?  which is nice of them, but I have no idea! <br /> <br /> For me, connecting is most important. If someone is being respectful, I don't care what they use. I'd love to have an interaction with someone who says a pronoun that doesn't seem true for me at that moment, and we talk about it -- we connect over it. Excluded from all this is, of course, is hate speech. I just don't engage that. <br /> <br /> I don't want to deflect the heart of the question though! Personally, I don't walk around thinking of myself as  her,   man,   they  or any other word we've currently got going. I guess that's part of why I love hearing everybody's stories on Vine -- I can relate to men and women and everyone. When we're talking about being human and having feelings, there is so much that we have in common.<br /> <br /> <strong>What’s the one thing you hope people take away from what you're doing? If you could boil everything down into one message, what would it be?</strong><br /> Always, always, always the message is the same: There Is Nothing Wrong With You. With varying degrees of success I'm sure, I keep it all hovering around that theme. Tweets, Instagram and, of course, my Vines are all an effort to help people ditch the self-hate and self-judgement. What could be more important? <br /> <br /> <strong>What do you want to accomplish in 2015?</strong><br /> Let's take over the world! I would be very happy if The Message (see above) could reach more people and bring more of us together. Helping one person is a cause for celebration to me, and I plan to keep celebrating that one-at-a-time connection by Vining my heart out. <br /> <br /> <em>Want to see more from Jeffrey Marsh?

"Les Freres Corbusier Is Back! And So Is Herbert Hoover!"	"Now that Alex Timbers is a big Broadway director and also the co-creator/writer of an Amazon series (<em>Mozart in the Jungle</em>), I was afraid we wouldn't see much from his theater company, Les Freres Corbusier. But not so! Les Freres is back with a tribute to, or a roast of, our nation's 31st president, Herbert Hoover. I've seen the majority of Les Freres' past works, from <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> to <em>Heddatron</em> to, my favorite, <em>A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant</em>. My friend and I loved <em>A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant</em> so much. She gave birth on October 29 and, a few days later, I asked her what the baby was for Halloween. She replied:  How about he wore this tunic that is reminiscent of a costume in our favorite Scientology pageant?  I seriously can't believe it doesn't come back every season, but, moving on.<br /> <br /> Les Freres is back to its roots, off-off-Broadway, with a special workshop production of <em>Here's Hoover! The Historic Herbert Hoover 2014 Comeback Special</em>, written by Sean Cunningham, with songs by Michael Friedman (Broadway's <em>Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson</em> with Timbers) and directed by Timbers. The piece--running at the Abrons Arts Center through December 21--is inspired by Elvis Presley's iconic 1968 <em>Comeback Special</em>, except its starring Hoover. He doesn't have the same sideburns, but he is desperate to reclaim his relevance, politically and culturally. Who doesn't want to see a Herbert Hoover concert spectacular? But -- who thought of it? And why?<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HeresHoover0031r.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-13-HeresHoover0031r.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HeresHoover0031r-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 295  /></a><br /> <br /> I posed some questions to the creatives behind the hysterical piece:<br /> <br /> <strong>Q: When did you start working on the show?</strong><br /> <strong><br /> Timbers: </strong>The show began life about 8 or 9 years ago.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cunningham:</strong> I believe it was 9 years ago now: Alex and I had an evening when we went out for drinks and came up with 4 possible shows concepts. 2 were forgotten almost immediately, 1 received a reading at Ars Nova and stalled out, and the last reached Michael Friedman and became Here's Hoover. <br /> <br /> <strong>Friedman</strong>: I got involved right before we did some development work in La Jolla. I had done three shows with Sean, and <em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson </em>with Alex.<br /> <br /> <strong>Q: Why Hoover? What sparked the interest in him specifically?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Timbers: </strong>Les Freres has always been interested in legacy and the reappraisal of historical figures. In part, what sparked us to Hoover was that he was one of the few Presidents of the 20th century that hasn't undergone a major reexamination by historians.<br /> <br /> Hoover also lived for quite a long time once he was out of office. It seemed like an intriguing question to wonder what it would be like to have your political life defined so clearly by a single historical event and a perceived reaction to said event--and then live out the remainder of your life knowing your legacy has been defined and not being able to do anything to alter it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cunningham: </strong>We were fascinated by the fact this was a genuinely extraordinary man - an orphan from Iowa who became a globetrotting mining millionaire by 27 and then headed massive humanitarian efforts during World War I - who is remembered now for the only part of his life that didn't go amazingly well. Throw in that he died at 90, having survived for 31 years after leaving the presidency and another 20 after the death of his beloved wife of 45 years, and we thought,  This is a little more interesting than Gerald Ford.  Not to knock Jerry. <br /> <strong><br /> Q: What do you think constitutes a failed vs. successful presidency? Were you thinking of that when working on this show?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Timbers: </strong>One of the key qualities to being a successful politician is one's ability to connect emotionally with your constituents. A lot of historians view Hoover's greatest flaw as his inability to communicate effectively his empathy for the American public. But one looks at Carter's  crisis of confidence  speech and can make a case that too much empathy repels. So it's a question we thought would be ripe to explore.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cunningham: </strong>That is an extremely interesting and virtually impossible to answer question! I think it's a mix of:<br /> 1. Undeniably great achievements: Keeping America unified during a Civil War like Lincoln or desegregating the military like Truman are feats that only become more worth celebrating with each passing year. Presidents like Rutherford B. Hayes don't have a whole lot of these.<br /> 2. Inspiring or dispiriting the nation: Clearly some leaders - say, George Washington or JFK - made Americans think,  Anything is possible.  And others - thinking Andrew Johnson and Nixon - made Americans muse,  What's the point of even trying? <br /> <br /> These two criteria are often (but not always) connected, which is something I think infuriated Hoover both during his term and in the years to come.<br /> <br /> <strong>Friedman: </strong>I think after [<em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</em>], which was about an apparently successful presidency that history has increasingly judged a disaster, in terms of economics, human rights, it was interesting to look at a presidency that ended in apparent failure, but which history hasn't yet made its final judgment on. I don't tend to agree with Hoover more than with Jackson, but his failure doesn't really have anything to do with the things I disagree with. <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HeresHoover0074r.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-13-HeresHoover0074r.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HeresHoover0074r-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Q: Who came up with the Elvis conceit? How did that person/people come up with it?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Timbers:</strong> Sean Cunningham and Michael Friedman are responsible for all the brilliant dialogue and songs in the show and the realization of the situation and these fantastic characters, but the crude premise of the show stems from my fascination with the 1968 Elvis special.<br /> <br /> I loved a few things about it: <br /> 1. The idea of having the self-awareness of one's own career arc to call your concert a  comeback  special (whether this was Elvis' idea, the producer's, or whomever). <br /> 2.The wild emotional intimacy that Elvis had with the concert attendees and his ability to break the  fourth wall  without any sense of artifice. <br /> 3. And, finally, from a purely directorial perspective, Elvis had a thrust stage set up with girls surrounding him and fawning, seated on pillows. Simultaneously though, Elvis had this quite gruff and playful relationship with his older, male instrumentalists that seemed so casual that it almost had no interest or regard for the surrounding audience at all. <br /> <br /> The set up of all this was a precursor to the later <em>Unplugged</em> and <em>Storytellers </em>series--and just had an informality and general strangeness that seemed worth exploring. Eventually pageantry and pop instincts kicked in on the Elvis special, with costume changes, back up singers, and enormous light up signs--but the first gesture of the special was truly idiosyncratic and borderline bizarre.<br /> <br /> We wanted to honor all those elements--the pillows, the muttering ax men, the leather jumpsuits, and lightbulb billboards--as well as the rockabilly sound, and we thought: who is more ripe for a comeback than Herbert Hoover? So that's where the idea came to be of mashing up the peculiar idiom of the Elvis special and the specific historical figure of our 31st President.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cunningham: </strong>I'd also been obsessed by the Elvis '68 Special - when I was working at the sadly unlaunched magazine Maxim for Kids many years ago I remember going on my lunch break to Times Square to buy the DVD set at the then-existent Virgin Megastore -  and I thought there was something wonderful about someone as practical as Herbert Hoover deciding he needed to connect with people on a more emotional level and stumbling upon footage of The King and thinking,  I shall do that,  as if overpowering sexual charisma comes with a handy on and off switch.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Friedman: </strong>I mean, Elvis. What's not to love?<br /> <br /> <em>All photos © Joan Marcus.

"Saudi Artist Photographs Daily Life From Behind A Veil And Learns Unexpected Lesson"	"While the mandate that women should cover their hair is an tenet of Islamic belief, the act of wearing a veil that completely shields a woman's face is a matter of tradition, not religion. For Saudi photographer <a href= http://www.faisalalmalki.com/  target= _hplink >Faisal Almalki</a>, this female ritual remained one shrouded in mystery. He resolved to experience the practice for himself, documenting the entire experience with his camera.<br /> <br /> <img alt= untitiled  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381070/thumbs/o-UNTITILED-900.jpg  /><br /> <br />  It started as both a visual and investigative experiment,  Almalki told the Huffington Post Arts.  From a visual point of view, I -- as a photographer and person -- cherish sight and I've always wondered how veils affect sight and seeing. But on a more contextual level, I've always wanted to understand this sub-culture and I thought if I managed to at least see the world they way they see it, I might scratch the surface of 'walking a mile in their shoe.' <br /> <br /> For his photographic investigation, Almalki took inspiration from 20th century German biologist Jakob von Uexkull, particularly his idea of the '<em>umwelt</em>' or 'self-world as perceived by organisms living within it.' The artist stepped into the role of biologist to fully immerse himself in this alien way of life.  Understanding how organisms experience their surroundings, needs and motivations can only be achieved by stepping into their perceptual world,  the exhibition expressed.  An organism creates and reshapes its own <em>umwelt</em> when it interacts with its environment.  <br /> <br /> <img alt= breath  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381072/thumbs/o-BREATH-900.jpg  /><br />  <br /> Almaki titled his series  Lone Canyon,  referencing the gap between a woman and her veil. Yet as the photographic process continued, the artist noticed it changing shape.  I took a few photos of flowers as seen from behind the veil, except some of those flowers weren’t real –- but the veil affects vision enough for us (ie. Her) not to see the difference. And that’s when I realized that I wasn’t trying to understand veiled women, I was trying to judge them.  While the project began as an effort to see through an Islamic woman's eyes (and veil), it ended up revealing the biased mode of viewing the artist himself possessed.<br /> <br />  Those pictures instead became a portrait of my prejudice,  he explained.  I’ve always resented how some western media outlets profiled Muslims and Middle Eastern, and this showed me how I was doing the same. Turning the veil onto that barrier between us and 'the others,' whoever that might be. <br /> <br /> <img alt= post  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381076/thumbs/o-POST-900.jpg  /><br /> <br /> As Almaki's series progressed, the symbols associated with the veil changed shape.  When I started working on this project, I kept saying that I wasn't pro or against veils, I just wanted to offer their perspective to the world.  Yet Almaki realized that for many, the veil isn't just a symbol of difference but of inferiority, of otherness.  Suddenly, the veil, became a symbol of prejudice, that wall between any person and 'the others.'  Almaki's project then transformed into an investigation of the invisible veil that so many unknowingly wear, the obstructive layer of prejudice.<br /> <br />  Lone Canyon  runs at Athr Gallery in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia until January 10, 2015.

"Designers Recreated Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel IRL"	"Do you wish the world around you was just a little more symmetrical? Maybe eternally washed in a candy-colored Instagram filter? Perhaps with a stronger Bill Murray presence? Basically, do you yearn for a daily life that looks identical to a Wes Anderson film? <br /> <br /> You should think about booking a trip to Budapest. <br /> <br /> <img alt= buda  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387196/thumbs/o-BUDA-900.jpg  /><br /> <br /> Earlier this year, during <a href= http://designweek.hu/2014/  target= _hplink >Budapest design week</a>, curators at <a href= http://nextartgaleria.hu/aktualis/  target= _hplink >NextArt Galeria</a> teamed up with designers Zsuzsa Megyesi and Attila F. Kovacs from <a href= http://a-z.eu.com/  target= _hplink >A+Z Design Studio</a> to lift Anderson's aesthetic from the screen to real life. Opting to creating an art experience far removed from the  white cube,  NextArt installed its gallery's goods in a space crafted to mimic the set of  The Grand Budapest Hotel.  <br /> <br /> The resulting lounge, a lavish medley of furniture, design, film and contemporary art, feels like a haunted version of Anderson's set, imbuing the famously twee visionary with an extra dose of darkness. A+Z contributed the eerie design touches like the candle-holder and chandelier, while artists including András Braun, Tamás Dobos and Lili K. Fehéri submitted artworks equally ominous. <br /> <br /> Anderson buffs, eat your heart out and enjoy the unorthodox gallery experience below.

Teicher</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt= arm  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387510/thumbs/o-ARM-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>The Cosmic Crusher and Grandmaw Foots face off in the final match.</small><br /> </center><br /> <br /> When Katrina Arnold photographed a ladies arm wrestling brawl in New Orleans a few years ago, she was instantly hooked. The raucous events, which are hosted by <a href= http://nolaw.org/  target= _hplink >New Orleans Ladies Arm Wrestling</a>, combine the performative, athletic elements of a WWE match with the communal, boozy aspects of a trivia night. It’s one of more than 25 chapters across the world under the umbrella of the<a href= http://www.clawusa.org/the-leagues/  target= _hplink > Collective of Lady Arm Wrestlers. </a><br /> <br /> “They're such colorful events. You never know what's going to happen,” Arnold said. “I got addicted. I ended up joining the collective and taking pictures of my friends.”<br /> <br /> At NOLAW’s events, which are held a few times a year at bars, galleries, and other spaces across the city, eight arm wrestlers—each with their own costumed persona, theme song, and entourage—compete before hundreds of spectators. According to NOLAW, “rules are determined and managed by the referee, only to be manipulated and corrupted by celebrity judges, crowd hecklers, and dolla billz.”<br /> <br /> The events aren’t just fun and games. They’re also fundraisers, with all proceeds benefiting local groups supporting women and children. (The groups, in return, create the winner’s trophy and submit a member to wrestle in the tournament.)<br /> <br /> Photographing arm wrestling, Arnold said, is like photographing a concert: It involves shooting fast-moving subjects in low light, as well as avoiding getting in the way of audience members. Still, she said, NOLAW’s events are “a photographer’s dream.” Hilarious wrestler alter egos—Babe Lincoln, Amelia Armheart, Ruth Hater Ginsburg—come with equally outrageous costumes and stunts as they prepare to compete. Half-time acts include drag queens and burlesque dancers. Crowds are loud and enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> “We want to create a fun, safe atmosphere where we can show off these strong, empowered women doing something that allows them to act out however they want,” she said. “You can be sexy, strong funny—you create a character. The best part is seeing these expressions come out on stage. It's more about performance than the actual arm wrestling.”<br /> <br /> Arnold’s photographs will be on display in the exhibition, “Katrina Arnold: Wrists Up” at New Orleans’ Gradoux Gallery as part of PhotoNOLA from Dec. 4 through Dec. 7.<br /> <br /> <em><a href= http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/12/03/katrina_arnold_photographs_new_orleans_ladies_arm_wrestling_tournaments.html  target= _hplink >See more photos on Slate.</a></em> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 21:10:25 -0500"	"arts"
"Alvin Ailey Unveils World Premiere, <i>Odetta</i>"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Odetta_Bio1_930_01.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-Odetta_Bio1_930_01.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Odetta_Bio1_930_01-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 320  /></a><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wednesday night I saw an array of beautiful luminaries including: the still handsome Harry Belafonte, the ever talented Ruben Santiago Hudson, and the magnificent Jessye Norman (to name just a few) who came out to see the world premiere of <em>Odetta</em>, choreographed by Mathew Rushing for<strong> Alvin</strong> <strong>Ailey</strong> <strong>American Dance Company</strong> and presented at  <strong>New York City Center</strong>. <br /> <br /> Legendary Odetta Holmes was one of the boundless and stunning voices of the civil rights movement, wise in thought, rich in voice and able to convey the very deep nature of anger and despair that swept the African American culture onto the rocky road to freedom from tyranny and isolation -- embodied through the earthy sound of folk music, composed by many and sung Ms. Holmes. Listening to a recording of her talking about the trials of these times with such poetic grace it is hard not to be stirred by her words and all the history of feeling such marginalization. Some of the songs which the choreography is set to are, <em>Sometimes I feel Like a Motherless Child, Cool Water and Glory, Glory. </em>Hope Boykin presented a buoyant Odetta in her physical incarnation as the activist/singer setting her profound voice to motion. <br /> <br /> A favorite moment was when Rachael McLaren and Marcus Jarrel Willis pantomimed the famously comical <em>There's a Hole in the Bucket</em> from an old recording of Harry Belafonte and Odetta. I could not help but turn around for a moment to see Harry Belfonte smiling while leaning on his walking stick. Marcus Jarrel Willis was a delightful Henry to Ms. McLaren's Liza. <br /> <br /> The evening radiated passionate feeling from the dancers to the audience which was returned with the over-wilhelming appreciation of all seated. It did seem sometimes like the synchronicity of the dancing was not quite fully cooked; the lighting design was dull and lackluster, the costuming was mediocre at best, even with that being said I would not have missed it for the world. Alvin Ailey's <em>Revelations</em> is no less inspired now then it was in 1960. Especially <em>Sinner Man </em>danced by Jeroboam Bozenan, Collin Heyward, and Sean Aron Carmon.

We're having a rare moment in America where we're being forced to confront our troubled social history with law enforcement and race, and ask ourselves hard questions about who we are as a society. And the men and women in the streets in Ferguson are a big part of the biggest conversation of the year.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Ebola Caregivers</strong><br /> <img alt= ebola doctors  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386032/thumbs/r-EBOLA-DOCTORS-large570.jpg  /><br /> <em> Andadolu Agency via Getty Images <small></small></em><br /> They are the front line in the war against the biggest Ebola outbreak in history. It's too easy to forget about an epidemic half a world away, but the healthcare workers struggling to contain the disease that has already killed 7,000 people in West Africa deserve to be recognized for their efforts, bravery, and sacrifice.<br /> <br /> <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong><br /> <img alt= putin horse  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386002/thumbs/r-PUTIN-HORSE-large570.jpg  /><br /> <em>AFP via Getty Images <small></small></em><br /> Sure, he's basically a Bond villain, but the Russian president has managed to stay in the spotlight this year from the protests around the Sochi Winter Olympics to the Russian annexation of Crimea, to promoting unrest in eastern Ukraine. You don't have to like the guy, but it's hard to argue with the effect he's had on 2014.<br /> <br /> <strong>Taylor Swift</strong><br /> <img alt= taylor swift  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386102/thumbs/r-TAYLOR-SWIFT-large570.jpg  /><br /> <em>Associated Press <small></small></em><br /> Time will tell if Taylor Swift's rejection of Spotify's music streaming business model was a tempest in a digital teacup or a seachange moment as artists push back against emerging forms of distribution. One thing is clear - as one of the world's top-selling artists, she has an important role to play in figuring out how the new digital world will compensate creative people for their work.<br /> <br /> <strong>Jack Ma</strong><br /> <img alt= jack ma  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386120/thumbs/r-JACK-MA-large570.jpg  /><br /> <em>Associated Press<small></small></em><br /> The former English teacher founded Alibaba (think the Amazon.com of China), and cashed in with a $25 billion IPO.

"Social Worker Empowers Muslim Women In Need With Sewing Class"	"When Tahani Jabarin started the Introduction to Sewing and Dressmaking program at the <a href= http://www.daralhijrah.net/ns/  target= _hplink >Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center</a> in northern Virginia, she was hoping to create  a road to self-sufficiency  for Muslim women in her area. Made possible by a $10,000 grant from <a href= http://www.irusa.org/  target= _hplink >Islamic Relief</a>, a U.S.-based charity organization, the sewing class graduated its first class of 12 students on Nov. 5.<br /> <br /> Jabarin, 37, told The Huffington Post she could not be happier with the results.  Thank God things went great,  she said.<br /> <br /> A social worker at Dar Al-Hijrah with no background in sewing, Jabarin said she chose the subject because it's something women with children can do from home. Jabarin runs the program, but she hired a woman with commercial sewing experience to teach the actual classes. Women ages 18 and above who earn half the area median income or less, or who receive financial assistance like food stamps, were eligible to sign up for the first round of lessons, as long as they agreed to attend every one, Jabarin said.<br /> <br /> Participants were also asked to pay a $300 fee for the class, but were issued waivers if they were unable to afford the cost. In exchange, the women received six hours of instruction every week for 16 weeks, with an additional four-hour workshop on starting their own business. Projects included clothing and home decor like curtains and lampshades. Dar Al-Hijrah sells the students' work on-site, Jabarin said, and each student gets 50 percent of whatever proceeds her pieces bring in, meaning the women can receive an income even during the program.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sewing class  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371058/thumbs/o-SEWING-CLASS-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps most significantly, those who completed 100 hours of sewing received their own machine, which Jabarin described as crucial for ensuring the women would continue their work after graduating. Of the 12 women who graduated in November, Jabarin said that more than half started making an income within two weeks of completing the course. A new 16-week course, she said, began earlier this month.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sewing class  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371048/thumbs/o-SEWING-CLASS-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> <br /> Jabarin spoke with one of the graduates on behalf of HuffPost Religion to illustrate the program's effect on participants. Due to a language barrier, Jabarin spoke to the woman in Arabic and translated her answers into English.<br /> <br /> <strong>How did you find the sewing group?</strong><br /> <br /> My name is Fawzia, and I was born in Sudan. I am 42 years old, and I have eight children, ages 25, 23, 17, 9, 8, 5, 2 years old and 4 months old. As an immigrant mother with eight children, I was facing financial instability that lost me my apartment and led me to seek a home in a shelter. Fortunately, the shelter I was placed in happened to be within walking distance of Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center. Through [a social worker's] help, I joined the sewing class, which enabled me to become self-sufficient via training whilst establishing an income. I applied for a waiver, since I had no income through which to pay for this class, and I received it, rendering my sewing lessons charge-free.<br /> <br /> <strong>What have been some of the biggest struggles in your life since coming to the U.S.?</strong><br /> <br /> My most immediate issue was the language barrier. I required some time to learn the English language and become accustomed to speaking it. Secondly, as a mother, I faced the enormous problem of finding an apartment to rent for me to live in with my children. Having been blessed with a large family, it was difficult finding a place big enough to accommodate us. Not being able to be a self-sufficient mother who could provide for her children shook me to the core.<br /> <br /> <strong>In what ways, if any, does the holiday season affect these concerns?</strong><br /> <br /> The holiday season is more taxing, as this is a family-oriented time during which I wish to present my children with the most joyous experience possible whilst also working hard to provide for them. I received support from my children’s elementary school, which donated gift cards to me in order to be able to purchase the Thanksgiving turkey. Simultaneously, I receive continuous support from Dar Al-Hijrah, which has a thrift store on-site. At any point that I need assistance buying clothing, I apply for aid and receive a $100 gift card to use at the store in order to keep my children and myself warm during this colder time of year. <br /> <br /> <strong>In what ways has joining the sewing class made a difference in your life?</strong><br /> <br /> During this difficult year of my life, these obstacles enclosed me in a severe depression that I even received therapy for. Nothing seemed to really help me deal with the crippling mentality that I was unproductive until I joined the sewing group. Walking down from the shelter to the Islamic Center every Monday and Wednesday became something to look forward to, and my mood was automatically elevated on those days.<br /> <br /> Additionally, the shelter kept telling me that I had an “exit date” and that I had to find a place to live. It just so happened that my graduation date coincided with my exit date from the shelter. It was my graduation, and the program director’s recommendation, that allowed the shelter to extend my stay for one more week. My life had finally begun looking up. I was becoming self-sufficient, which had always been my dream, and I was finally able to provide for my children.<br /> <br /> I learned that much like sewing, life occurs in several stages, not all at once. Having acquired patience, I was able to push myself through these difficult times and persevere until I was able to improve my life. Having received my certificate of completion and my sewing machine, I finally felt like a productive member of society.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are your hopes for improving your family’s circumstances moving forward, and how will the skills you’ve learned through the sewing group help you?</strong><br /> <br /> The day I graduated, I received my sewing machine from Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center. Furthermore, Dar Al-HIjrah connected me with the county’s case workers, who held several workshops that taught us to transform our sewing skills into a commercial method in order for us to establish our own businesses and become self-employed.<br /> <br /> I walked into this class thinking I would only be taught to sew clothing, but soon thereafter I learned that was not the case. Aside from sewing clothing, I learned how to create home décor items like handkerchiefs and even custom-made draperies. I am now beginning to build my clientele, and I plan to develop my skills in this field in order to become more proficient and to find even more stability in my job. This way, I will finally have a steady income and be able to independently support my family.<br /> <br /> <em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Learn more about Islamic Relief and how you can contribute to its ongoing grants and programs <a href= https://secure2.convio.net/irusa/site/SPageServer;jsessionid=4569B1589CCFA21CD1D360E867DD2DF6.app260a?pagename=domesticlandingpage  target= _hplink >here</a>.</em><br /> <br /> <em>This story is part of series called <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/12-families/  target= _hplink >12 Days Of Giving</a>.

"Christmas Trees Past in Philadelphia"	"Although retailers seem determined to start the holiday shopping season as early as October these days, for many of us the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season does not start until after Thanksgiving. We bring boxes of holiday decorations out of storage, place candles in our windows, buy a tree, start baking cookies, and do whatever else our families have traditionally done over the years to celebrate the holiday. The Library Company's photographic collections confirm that Philadelphians of a hundred years ago celebrated the holiday in many of the same ways as we do now.<br /> Some of the busiest public spaces in Philadelphia, like Independence Square, were decorated for the holiday season during the early 20th century. At 6PM on Christmas Eve 1913 in front of a crowd estimated at 20,000 people, the mayor's wife threw a light switch to illuminate a huge spruce tree behind Independence Hall. Decorated with 4,200 red, white, and blue lights and topped with a star of 56 lights representing each signer of the Declaration of Independence, the Philadelphia Inquirer described the spruce as the  first Christmas tree that ever was set up for all the people of the city.  <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-raup2012591.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-raup2012591.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-raup2012591-thumb.jpg  width= 549  height= 570  /></a><br /> William Rau, <em>Christmas tree in Independence Square, Phila, Christmas Eve, 1913</em>, gelatin sliver photograph. Library Company of Philadelphia. Gift of David Long.<br /> <br /> Trees on a much smaller scale were put up in Philadelphians' homes and also lovingly, if seemingly chaotically, decorated. Strands of beads, fans, dancing figures, and miniature parasols competed for attention with simpler ornaments. Additionally, elaborate model railroads and miniature village scenes adorned the spaces below many of the trees. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-richp9266865.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-richp9266865.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-richp9266865-thumb.jpg  width= 427  height= 570  /></a><br /> James B.

Gift of Matthew Schultz.<br /> <br /> Without their decorations, the trees themselves were rather forlorn looking specimens, lacking the fullness and triangular shape coveted by consumers today. Unless we were channeling our inner Charlie Brown, most of these trees would not be a part of our Christmas celebrations today.  The owners of these trees, however, did not attempt to hide their  bald spots,  nor did they cut off the trunk bottoms to make sure their trees did not touch the ceilings. They decorated them as they were, and proudly took photographs showing the results of their labors.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-danenhourp2013252.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-danenhourp2013252.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-danenhourp2013252-thumb.jpg  width= 335  height= 570  /></a><br /> F.

"'Exodus: Gods And Kings' - Grand! Truly the Most Epic Version of the Story of Moses"	"<center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Exodus.2014.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-Exodus.2014.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Exodus.2014-thumb.jpg  width= 214  height= 318  /></a></center><br /> <br /> Ridley Scott has created quite an extraordinary adventure based on the Biblical story of Moses rising up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses and setting 600,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues. Starring Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton and Ben Kingsley, this film tells how one man's daring courage took on a mighty empire. Using state of the art visual effects and 3D imagery, Scott brings new life to this classic story. KIDS FIRST! Critic Gerry O. (age 12)  comments,  <em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> is a masterpiece that everybody should watch. This film combines a story about religion with a sense of history, while still having a touch of action, suspense and even a perfect sprinkle of romance.   Keefer B. (age 14) adds,  The landscape of this film is colossal! If you get a chance, watch this on the big screen. Some of you will wait and watch it on your phone or laptop but that does the film a huge disservice. Whether it's 3D or not, it's amazing when watching Egypt being built with swarms of people.

Critic, age 12<br /> <center> <iframe width= 560  height= 315  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/VVmCVqxm1og  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br /> <br /> Not only does this film teach you about one of the most important things in Jewish history, it tells one of the greatest stories history has to offer.<em> Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> is a masterpiece that everybody should watch. <br /> <br /> This film combines a story about religion with a sense of history, while still having a touch of action, suspense and even a perfect sprinkle of romance. <br /> <br /> This movie is about an Egyptian prince named Moses that gets exiled from Egypt when it is discovered that Moses is Hebrew (Jewish). After surviving through a long travel, he starts a new life, gets married and has a child. One day, he climbs a mountain that is known as God's mountain, where he gets knocked out and has an encounter with God who tells him to go to Egypt and free his people -- the Jewish slaves, and take them back to the promise land.<br /> <br /> This movie is stupendous! Of course it will appeal to Jewish people for this is a very big part of Jewish history, but I recommend this film for everybody. This tells a truly remarkable story about one man freeing four hundred thousand slaves from the Egyptian Empire with the help of what he believes to be God. While this is a whopping two hour long film, I didn't want it to end. This story is one that requires time to tell it and is truly inspiring. On a personal note, as a Jew, this film helped me understand my culture better and, in a way, to live through this journey with the characters. This film makes me want to do more and find out more about this part of history.  <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when Moses climbs this mountain that is known to be God's and, after getting knocked out when rocks fall on him, he wakes up to a bush on fire. A boy that turns out to be God is standing in front of him, building a small pyramid out of little stone cubes and telling Moses to free his people, implying free the Jewish people from Egypt. <br /> <br /> This movie is very mature. It takes a look at a very violent time in history. So, I would recommend it to ages 13 to 18. I also give it 5 out 5 stars for fantastic acting, directing, producing and breath-taking backgrounds and sets. If you have a chance to see this film in 3D, I strongly recommend it because the quality of the film is absolutely breathtaking. I hope that creators will continue with the rest of the books that are offered by Torah. <br /> <br /> <em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em><br /> Reviewed by Keefer C.B.<br /> <center><iframe width= 560  height= 315  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/RlZPezEQBxM  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br /> <br /> Grand! Truly the most epic version of this story. Moses( Christian Bale) goes through a journey of faith to set the slaves of Eygpt free from Pharaoh Rhamses (Joel Edgerton). <br /> <br /> The actors in this film are superb. From Edgerton's portrayal of arrogant Ramses to Ben Kingsley's portrayal as the wise and spiritual Nun. Every character has a distinct identity, especially my favorite character, Moses who goes through dynamic changes in this film thanks to an outstanding performance by Bale.   <br />       <br /> The landscape of this film is colossal! If you get a chance, watch this on the big screen. Some of you will wait and watch it on your phone or laptop but that does the film a huge disservice. Whether it's 3D or not, it's amazing when watching Egypt being built with swarms of people. The desert locations they chose set the tone of the film. The most monumental scene is when the slaves walk through the Red Sea. It's a race against time and tide that keeps you on the edge of you seat.  <br /> <br /> The story focus is on Moses' relationship with a higher power. Some of the best scene are him talking or arguing with God, who is portrayed as a little boy (Isaac Andrews). However, in the film this character is identified as Malak which is the Hebrew term for Angel. This raises questions,  Is he talking to God? Is Moses imagining these conversations? Could it be that the boy he is talking to represents himself?  Not only does this show how extraordinary the storytelling is, it also results in the audience coming to their own conclusions. That shows that you don't have to believe in a specific religion to enjoy this film. Which is an ambitious move on the director's part, but I'm glad they did it.  <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last conversation Moses has with Malak. This is when Moses write down the Ten Commandments. I adore this scene because it's a reflection of the journey that Moses went on. And, this is another great scene between Bale and Andrews.<br /> <br /> The message of this story is,  how far will you go for your faith.  God has had enough of seeing his people suffer so he sends nine plagues to make Ramses let his people go. Ramses retaliates by killing more Hebrews. There is so much death. It leads to one to side with doing something even worse. By the end, one side wins but, when you really think about it, how many people died to get there? <br /> <br /> I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 14 through 18-year-olds. This film contains extremely brutal images that most young kids won't be able to handle. It's necessary because the story focuses on showing the inhumanity of slavery. Other than that, check out this epic film in theaters December 12. <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-GerryOrz.2014.LR.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-GerryOrz.2014.LR.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-GerryOrz.2014.LR-thumb.jpg  width= 379  height= 570  /></a></center><br /> Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

"Who Has the Answers?"	"You may know him as the man who wears many hats or for his work that dominated hip hop culture in the 90s and early 2000s. He is still working today with his shows  Sway in the Morning (radio) and  Off the Bat from the MLB Fan Cave  (television). Students and faculty of Syracuse University had the pleasure of hearing how Sway Calloway climbed the mountain to success on the evening of November 13, 2014.<br /> <br /> One of his many quotes that touched me was his advice for aspiring journalists, where he told us to  Create your own seat, because no one can duplicate it.  Sway has created his own seat in all areas of the industry since his beginnings as a rap artist in his teen years to becoming someone who has interviewed people across the spectrum from the Notorious B.I.G. to Jessica Alba. It obviously doesn't end here since he currently has a show on MTV and a show on Sirius XM. I have nothing but respect for this man. For someone of his caliber to have achieved all that he has, remained true to himself, and be so down to earth, is something to aspire to. Even when asked about how he feels about the success he has attained thus far, his response was,  I don't feel like I've made it, I feel like I'm working,  which shows that he doesn't believe that he is above anything and that he has to work just as hard to maintain his legacy as he did to obtain it.<br /> <br /> He is the epitome of how there isn't a set formula to achieve excellence. He didn't finish college, and was told that he would never be on radio, amongst other situations. Yet, he is one of the most powerful voices in the business. His life shows us that you do what you love, or as he said,  If you have something that you're passionate about, treat it extremely special.  With this said, don't do things because it is the societal norm or because it's the family tradition, work on a craft because YOU want it. This all comes down to self-worth and making sure that you  never compromise your integrity.  Only someone who has integrity would study the business  like it was the SAT,  and who follows their passion would turn down the chance to have a show on MTV three out of the four times it was offered to him. He just wouldn't be true to himself if he had taken up the offer the first three times, especially since he was already working on a show he had at the time.<br /> <br /> I can't possibly sum up all of the greatness I witnessed in one article, but I leave you two things. One, Sway definitely HAS the answers. Two, whether you want to be a singer, inventor, mathematician or a carpenter, you have to be  able to recognize opportunity and maximize it.

"Guess Which State Is About To Put Driver's Licenses On Smartphones"	"We’re creeping ever closer to a world in which you don’t need to carry a wallet.<br /> <br /> The state of Iowa will release a free smartphone app in 2015 that can be used in place of a physical driver’s license.

(It’s probably also a smart idea to continue to carry around your original license anyway, in case your smartphone battery dies.)<br /> <br /> <center><img alt= iowa  src= http://share.gifyoutube.com/Kdw8zq.gif  /></center><br /> <center><em>A mockup of the digital driver’s license. The head will actually move a little. <br /> (Source: Iowa.gov)</em></center><br /> <br /> Digital driver's licenses are just the latest thing moving out of our wallets and onto our phones. Money-transfer systems like <a href= https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/apple-pay/  target= _hplink >Apple Pay</a> and <a href= http://qz.com/277509/read-what-happens-when-a-bunch-of-over-30s-find-out-how-millennials-handle-their-money/  target= _hplink >Venmo</a> make it that much easier to survive without carrying cash or cards. <br /> <br /> The Iowa DOT is promoting the driver's license app as a way to eventually limit fraud of all sorts, including the production of fake IDs. People will verify their identity using a PIN code to open the app. <br /> <br /> The app is still very much in the development phase, Mark Lowe, director of the motor vehicle division for the Iowa DOT, told The Huffington Post. He noted that many of the security issues are getting worked out.<br /> <br /> Lowe said that one of the greatest concerns that the public has expressed about the idea is that law enforcement officers might ask to see someone’s driver’s license app, only to poke through other things on the smartphone. Officers aren’t legally allowed to do that, Lowe said. But to make sure people feel safe, they're creating a button that will allow officers to see the license without gaining access to anything else on the phone.<br /> <br /> Paul Steier, director of the Iowa Bureau of Investigation and Identity Protection, told HuffPost that the state may eventually allow people to only carry a digital license, doing away with their plastic card once and for all. <br /> <br /> “We see that as an option -- that someone could say I only want my driver’s license digitally, please,  Steier said.<br /> <br /> The app could also become much more than just a digital driver's license. The plan is to eventually integrate a number of other services into the app, like weather and driving alerts, or even the ability to access your personal record. <br /> <br /> H/T <a href= http://gizmodo.com/iowa-is-going-to-let-you-use-a-smartphone-as-your-drive-1669796842  target= _hplink >Gizmodo</a><br />  "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 15:32:35 -0500"	"teen"
"Are College Students Tempted To Sleep With A Hometown Ex During Breaks?"	"College students across the country are preparing to head home for winter break, and many of them will meet a dangerous temptation right in their hometown:  ex sex. <br /> <br /> What exactly is ex sex? Brown University sex columnist Margot Harris defined it in <a href= http://post.browndailyherald.com/2014/12/04/ex-sex/  target= _hplink >a piece last week</a> as  the sex that occurs after one breaks up with one's high school sweetheart and then comes back from college during one of the assorted breaks.  Research shows this isn't uncommon among young adults: <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/ex-sex-young-adults-study_n_2528856.html?1418410012  target= _hplink >one study found</a> nearly half of people ages 17 to 24 had gotten back together with an ex, and in more than half sex was part of the equation. <br /> <br /> But why exactly does a break from college and all its new and exciting potential conquests make us want to sleep with the old boyfriend or girlfriend we tossed out with our high school homework? HuffPost Live asked Harris and two other college sex columnists on Thursday about whether  ex sex  can ever be a good idea.<br /> <br /> <em>Watch that conversation in the video above, and <a href= http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/college-sex/546fb1f8fe344486d4000520  target= _hplink >click here</a> for the full HuffPost Live segment about sex and relationship trends on college campuses.</em><br /> <br /> <strong><a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/newsletter/huffpost-live  target= _hplink >Sign up here</a> for Live Today, HuffPost Live’s morning email that will let you know the newsmakers, celebrities and politicians joining us that day and give you the best clips from the day before!</strong> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 13:48:31 -0500"	"teen"

"Laci Green Reminds Us That Sexism Hurts Men Too"	"While sexism negatively affects women, <a href= https://twitter.com/gogreen18  target= _hplink >Laci Green</a> is here to remind us that <em>everyone</em> is impacted by gender inequality.  <br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/26/laci-green-mtv-braless-youtube_n_6214632.html?utm_hp_ref=making-it-work  target= _hplink >Green</a>, a sex-positive video blogger and peer sex educator, breaks down how sexism affects men and young boys in her video <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwQBlNVqL-E&list=PLTXiNEUzXWKT9xrbU3aUxqYloEL_W-8rr  target= _hplink > Does Sexism Hurt Men? </a> Her answer? Damn straight it does.  <br /> <br /> “Obviously, the fact that women and girls face inequalities is reason enough to stand up against sexism,  Green says.  But let’s not forget that sexism also affects men and boys.  <br /> <br /> Sexist conditioning tells men that the worst thing they can be is  like a woman  -- meaning being emotional, vulnerable or generally feminine. While none of these stereotypical gendered traits are actually bad (and don't ring true for all women), our culture pressures men to be the complete opposite, which can be just as hard as subscribing to the standards women face. <br />  <br /> As Green says in the clip, boys are told from a young age that they can't be emotional, they should be into sports and have  manly hobbies,  some of which include having lots of (heterosexual) sex to prove their manhood. While women are traditionally taught to stay at home as caregivers, men are told they need to be the sole breadwinners and leaders in their households. That's a lot of pressure for everyone. <br /> <br /> Sexism perpetuates “one version of masculinity, one way of being a real man that we impose on boys in a million subtle ways all throughout their lives and the effects of that are serious,  Green says. She also points out that out sexism affects gay men, lesbian women, trans* people and  everyone in between. <br /> <br /> “Understanding how these inequalities and attitudes permeate our society, and working to correct them, is in the best interest of everyone.” *Mic drop*<br /> <br /> <em>Head over to Green's YouTube channel <a href= https://www.youtube.com/user/lacigreen  target= _hplink >Sex+</a> for more information on sex-positive education. </em> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 11:53:47 -0500"	"teen"

"Facebook Basically Teasing Us With 'Dislike Button' At This Point"	"Facebook is considering adding a feature that <a href= http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/social.media/07/22/facebook.dislike.cashmore/index.html?_s=PM:TECH  target= _hplink >people have wanted</a> for a long time now: a  dislike  button. But don't hold your breath.<br /> <br /> CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, at <a href= https://www.facebook.com/qawithmark  target= _hplink >a public Q&A session</a> at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on Thursday, that the company has put a  great deal  of thought into adding a  dislike  button of some sort. <br /> <br />  You know, we're thinking about it,  Zuckerberg said. <br /> <br /> But he said he did not see the value in having a feature that would create up-or-down voting for people's Facebook posts, like what you see on Reddit. So don't expect to see something like this on the site any time soon:<br /> <br /> <img alt= facebook dislike  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2384250/thumbs/o-FACEBOOK-DISLIKE-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> Facebook is considering adding other buttons to express sentiment -- <a href= http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/01/facebook-considers-adding-the-hate-button/  target= _hplink >as it has done for years</a>. It has also been <a href= http://mashable.com/2010/07/23/facebook-dislike-button/  target= _hplink >thinking about</a> a  dislike  button for years, for that matter. <br /> <br /> But Facebook has no plan for creating additional buttons in the near future. The company has experimented with a <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/05/facebook-sympathize-button_n_4394451.html  target= _hplink > sympathize  button</a> and added easy-to-post <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/14/facebook-stickers-comments_n_5982546.html  target= _hplink >stickers</a>. There's even a <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/18/facebook-dislike-button_n_4468070.html  target= _hplink >thumbs down sticker</a>, but Facebook doesn't tally those the way it does  likes.  <br /> <br /> Zuckerberg acknowledged that people do want to express sentiments other than  liking,  especially when someone posts about a difficult issue.<br /> <br /> Expressing sentiment is already possible on Facebook: <br /> <br />  You know you can always comment,  Zuckerberg said -- though he admitted that clicking a button is easier than thinking up a witty comment.<br />  "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 11:09:42 -0500"	"teen"
"To Celebrate Taylor Swift's 25th Birthday, Here are 25 Things to Love About Her"	"These days, it seems everyone loves Taylor Swift. Her newest album <em>1989</em> sold 1.3 million copies in its first week and, all around the world, Swifties rejoiced. She's been everywhere lately: on talk shows, magazine covers and even on the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. <br /> <br /> But for those of you who are still skeptical about T-Swizzle, I've put together a list of twenty-five things to love about her in honor of her 25th birthday on December 13. <br /> <br /> <strong>1.</strong> She grew up on a Christmas tree farm. Seriously, I could stop right there. But I won't.<br /> <br /> <strong>2.</strong> She's 5'11  and rocks high heels everywhere she goes, even on stage. And she does it without hunching over like she's afraid of making other people feel small.<br /> <br /> <strong>3.</strong> She doesn't make other people feel small. In fact, she's notoriously kind, as evidenced by<a href= http://time.com/3273740/taylor-swift-instagram-comments-bullied-fan/  target= _hplink > the random notes of encouragement</a> she leaves her fans on their Instagram accounts,<a href= http://taylorswift.com/users/qne9EFrK/blogs/5324902  target= _hplink > that thirteen-hour meet and greet</a> where she gave as much attention to the last person as she did to the first, and her unwavering and outspoken <a href= http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/11/25/taylor-swift-supports-selena-gomez-crying-amas-performance/  target= _hplink >support</a> of women in her industry.<br /> <br /> <strong>4.</strong> <a href= http://time.com/3165825/taylor-swift-feminist-lena-dunham/  target= _hplink >She is a proud feminist</a> who doesn't shy away from calling out discrepancies in the way the media portrays male and female artists.<br /> <br /> <strong>5.</strong> She evolves. I don't care that you think she only writes about boys (see #4). Take a listen to her first album and compare it to <em>1989</em>. Hell, listen to her fourth album and compare it to <em>1989</em>. And it's not just her musical and personal style that has evolved; it's her view of the world and, most importantly, herself.<br /> <br /> <strong>6.</strong> She genuinely loves her fans and interacts with them on a daily basis. It's not uncommon for Taylor<a href= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2838730/Taylor-Swift-surprises-fan-sending-care-package-handwritten-notes-reading-tough-time.html  target= _hplink > to send random gift packages and handwritten notes to die-hard Swifties</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>7.</strong> SHE SENDS HANDWRITTEN NOTES. Who does that anymore? Taylor-effing-Swift, that's who.<br /> <br /> <strong>8.</strong> She has a sense of humor about how people view her romantic relationships. If you haven't watched <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ORhEE9VVg  target= _hplink >the  Blank Space  video</a>, now would be a good time.<br /> <br /> <strong>9.</strong> She embraces her sexuality without lowering her standards.<br /> <br /> <strong>10.</strong> She adores her family.<br /> <br /> <strong>11.</strong> <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFTa1KTnQ7E  target= _hplink >And her cats</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>12.</strong> She's a loyal friend who welcomes diversity in her closest relationships. Her besties include writer, actor and producer Lena Dunham, Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss, Selena Gomez, singer Ed Sheeran and her high school BFF Abigail Anderson.<br /> <br /> <strong>13.</strong> She sings live.<br /> <br /> <strong>14.</strong> She writes her own music.<br /> <br /> <strong>15.</strong> SHE WRITES HER OWN MUSIC.<br /> <br /> <strong>16.</strong> She stands up for her beliefs, even if they are unpopular.<a href= http://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-explains-why-she-left-spotify-2014-11  target= _hplink > She removed all her albums from Spotify </a>because she believes artists should be fairly compensated for their work. Because no matter how much money they've made in the past, IT IS STILL THEIR WORK (see #14 and #15).<br /> <br /> <strong>17.</strong> She is an incredibly savvy businesswoman who isn't afraid of taking big risks. When everyone told her that a pop album was a bad idea, particularly a pop album with a strange name and only half of Taylor's face showing on the cover, she did it anyway. You do you, Taylor.<br /> <br /> 18. She is humble about her success and <a href= http://time.com/3578249/taylor-swift-interview/  target= _hplink >openly appreciative of the platform it has given her to influence others</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>19.</strong> Can we just talk about her hair for a second? <br /> <br /> <strong>20.</strong> She handles awkward situations with style and class. She didn't bash Kanye West for stealing her thunder and acting like a petulant child. <a href= http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/taylor-swift-sings-about-kanye-at-vmas-we-can-be-friends--2010129  target= _hplink >She sang a song to him about forgiveness and grace</a>. <br /> <br /> <strong>21.</strong> <a href= http://greatideas.people.com/2014/06/17/taylor-swift-ina-garten-cooking-lesson/  target= _hplink >She cooks</a>. <br /> <br /> 22. She knows that life is filled with ups and downs, and she is vocal about taking her challenges and using them to grow. <br /> <br /> <strong>23.</strong> She's quirky and silly and finds joy in the small things, which is incredibly refreshing to see in someone who was <a href= http://www.forbes.com/profile/taylor-swift/  target= _hplink >ranked #18 on Forbes Celebrity 100 in June of this year</a>, worth an estimated $64 million.<br /> <br /> <strong>24.</strong> She enjoys being single and stated in a recent interview that <blockquote>You can have love all around you without being in love, and find romance in your everyday life without being in a romantic relationship. That can be just as fulfilling.</blockquote> <br /> <br /> <em>*slow clap*</em><br /> <br /> <strong>25</strong>. She doesn't do things for shock value. Instead, she focuses on constantly improving her art and building connections with the people who matter most: her family, her friends and her fans.<br /> <br /> Happy Birthday Taylor!

Peterson, the 2012 NFL MVP, was <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/18/adrian-peterson-suspended_n_6177578.html  target= _hplink >suspended without pay for at least the remainder of the 2014 season</a> on Nov. 18 for violations of the league's Personal Conduct Policy after <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/adrian-peterson-child-abuse-plea_n_6102284.html  target= _hplink >pleading no contest to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault</a> for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son.<br /> <br /> With support from the NFLPA, <a href= http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/11/20/adrian-peterson-appeal-nfl-players-association/19320665/  target= _hplink >Peterson appealed that suspension</a>, which indicated he could not be considered for reinstatement until April 2015. After the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/12/adrian-peterson-appeal-denied_n_6317828.html  target= _hplink >denial of his appeal</a> by NFL-appointed arbiter Harold Henderson on Friday, Peterson told ESPN that he had  considered real estate and a bid for the 2016 Olympics in the 200-meter and 400-meter events as fallback options.<br /> <br />  I've considered retiring from the NFL,  Peterson <a href= http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12021489/adrian-peterson-minnesota-vikings-disappointed-nfl-disciplinary-process-thought-retirement  target= _hplink >told ESPN</a>.  I still made $8 million dollars this year. I've thought about getting back into the real estate [business in Texas] I'm already in. That's something I've been interested in, something I'm involved in. I've thought about getting back into that. I've thought about going after the Olympics -- you only live once. It might be time for me to pursue that, as well. I love playing football, don't get me wrong, but this situation is deeper than that. For me, it's like, 'Why should I continue to be a part of an organization or a business that handles players the way they do? Making money off the field anyway, why not continue to pursue that (Olympic) dream and pursue other dreams and hang up the cleats?' <br /> <br /> Peterson has been an <a href= http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PeteAd01.htm  target= _hplink >elite NFL player</a> since being drafted out of Oklahoma in 2007, but lining up alongside world-class sprinters would be a very different challenge for the 29-year-old. <br /> <br />  Peterson is delusional if he thinks he has any chance of being a track and field Olympian,  <a href= http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/12/13/adrian-peterson-maybe-ill-retire-from-the-nfl-run-in-the-olympics/  target= _hplink >wrote Michael David Smith of ProFootballTalk</a> on Saturday.  Yes, Peterson is very fast by the standards of a normal human being, and even by the standards of an NFL player. No, Peterson is nowhere near as fast as an Olympic sprinter. If Peterson is serious about trying to qualify for the Olympics, he’d have a better chance at a more specialized sport like the bobsled. <br /> <br /> In a <a href= https://twitter.com/NFLPA/status/543534419815182336  target= _hplink >statement issued shortly after Peterson's appeal was denied</a>, the NFLPA indicated that the fight over Peterson's suspension was not over:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL. The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.</blockquote><br /> <br /> Citing an unnamed person with direct knowledge of the situation, the Associated Press reported that <a href= http://bigstory.ap.org/article/f6ffe7554c324c1e8e2167a2fb80783a/still-suspended-adrian-petersons-appeal-denied  target= _hplink >Peterson will continue his fight to return to football by filing a complaint against the NFL in federal court</a> as early as Monday. <br /> <br /> Peterson participated in the Vikings' opening game of the 2014 season before being <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/adrian-peterson-child-injury-indicted_n_5813210.html  target= _hplink >indicted in the child injury case</a> on Sept. 12. The Vikings then <a href= http://www.vikings.com/news/article-1/Statement-From-the-Minnesota-Vikings/fb9cab0c-9748-495a-ab74-9a86040cb673?campaign=social_20140917_31766716  target= _hplink >placed him on the Exempt/Commissioner’s Permission</a> list on Sept. 17, barring him from team activities until his legal proceedings were resolved.

Here are 10 things that I learned:<br /> <br /> 1.  Oakland Mayor <strong>Jean Quan</strong> was there personally requesting cash and toy donations for  Toys for Tots. <br /> <br /> 2.  <strong>Kevin McHale</strong>, former Boston Celtic is the head coach of the Houston Rockets.  Now he was been the head coach for two years, but I was unaware of it until now.<br /> <br /> 3.  <strong>A.C. Green</strong>, former Los Angels Laker was at the game.  I saw him in the media credential line.  Not sure why he was there.<br /> <br /> 4.  There is a pronunciation guide in the game notes which includes this guide for <strong>Stephen Curry</strong>: STEFF IN CURRY<br /> <br /> 5.   Curry is the flavor of the month,  as Stephen Curry is the Western Conference player of the month for the third time.<br /> <br /> 6.  <strong>Ruby Lopez</strong> the in-arena host for the Golden State Warriors is a mom, with a 2-month-old baby.<br /> <br /> 7.  It was their 91st consecutive home sellout.<br /> <br /> 8.  Their record is 19-2 with a lucky 13 win streak, the most in the franchises 69 year old history.<br /> <br /> 9.  In the 2013 playoffs the following words were on the back of the Warriors t-shirts:  strong, proud, loud, battle, unite, fierce, protect, and defend.<br /> <br /> 10.

"Floyd Mayweather Jr. Says He Wants To Fight Manny Pacquiao On May 2"	"<p>Floyd Mayweather Jr. says he's ready to fight Manny Pacquiao next May in a long anticipated bout that would be the richest ever in boxing.</p><br />               <p>Mayweather called for negotiations for the fight to be take place, though he warned Pacquiao not to expect to get anywhere near the money that he himself would make.</p><br />               <p> You lost twice and now you're coming back begging for the same money?  Mayweather asked.  That's not gonna happen. </p><br />               <p>In an interview on the Showtime network from a fight card he was promoting in San Antonio, Mayweather for the first time called for the fight to happen and even gave a date — May 2. He claimed it wasn't him but Pacquiao's promoter, Bob Arum, who has been the main obstacle for not making the fight in the last five years.</p><br />               <p> Floyd Mayweather is not ducking or dodging any opponent,  Mayweather said.  Bob Arum is stopping the fight. We have been trying to make this fight happen for many years behind the scene. </p><br />               <p>Pacquiao turned the pressure up on Mayweather to make the fight last month, saying the time had come to put on the much anticipated bout. Arum said he had also been in talks with CBS Corp. chairman Les Moonves about the fight.</p><br />               <p>CBS operates Showtime, which has Mayweather under contract for two more fights in May and September.</p><br />               <p>Mayweather repeated his old charges about Pacquiao not wanting to do blood tests prior to the fight for it not happening five years ago. He also said he offered Pacquiao $40 million for a bout, but he refused.</p><br />               <p>Mayweather, who hasn't lost in 47 fights, said he was confident he could beat Pacquiao and eager to star in an extremely lucrative fight.</p><br />               <p> I know that he's not on my level,  Mayweather said.  The fan would love to see the fight. And, of course, I want to go out with a bang. </p><br />               <p>No one knows how rich a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight would be, coming so late after it first should have happened in 2009. There are some who think both fighters have slipped some with advancing age, but there's no doubt that the fight still holds tremendous appeal.</p><br />               <p>It would likely gross at least $250 million, and Mayweather's purse alone would be more than $100 million.</p><br />               <p>Mayweather was not asked in the ringside interview about the murder-suicide of rapper Earl Warren Hayes and his wife in Los Angeles on Monday. Police spoke to Mayweather after the killings following media reports that he may have spoken to Hayes before he shot Stephanie Elyse Moseley and then took his own life in their apartment.</p> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 00:26:00 -0500"	"sports"
"After Honoring Eric Garner, LeBron's Voice Could Have Been Louder"	"Last Saturday, during the Chicago Bulls' pregame warmup against the steaming-hot Golden State Warriors, Derrick Rose wore a T-shirt displaying the words  I Can't Breathe.  It was a reference to the recent non-indictment of a NYPD police officer in the choking death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, in Staten Island. Garner's last words were  I can't breathe. <br /> <br />  That night we talked about how we supported [Rose],  teammate Tim Flowers <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/sports/basketball/derrick-rose-sees-taking-a-stand-in-eric-garner-case-as-his-responsibility.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >told <em>The New York Times</em></a>. Rose and Flowers were childhood friends who grew up together on the South Side of Chicago. Flowers added that  wearing the shirt was an important thing to do,  calling it  a responsibility.  <br /> <br /> Rose's effort to bring awareness to the ongoing issue of unarmed black men dying at the hands of police officers trickled down to the rest of the league, with many players following suit over subsequent nights. Even Kobe Bryant, who is often ridiculed for not publicly stating his opinions on major issues, partook in the demonstration along with some of his Lakers teammates. <br /> <br /> But this is now LeBron James' league, and there isn't a name that permeates our sports experience like his does. Both James and Kyrie Irving also decided to make a statement, wearing  I Can't Breathe  T-shirts over their jerseys prior to their conference matchup against the Brooklyn Nets. <br /> <br /> After the game James was asked his reason for wearing the T-shirt, and he <a href= http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2014/12/09/james-kyrie-nets-in-i-cant-breathe-shirts/20116207/  target= _hplink >responded</a>,  It was a message to the family. That I'm sorry for their loss, sorry to his wife. That's what it's about.  He went on to say,  I think everybody else gets caught up in everything else besides who's really feeling it, and that's the family. That's what it's about. <br /> <br /> Those statements aren't easy to hear. For once, LeBron James -- the anti-Michael Jordan in every way, no matter how much we try to compare the two -- sounded very Jordan-esque. It appears that James was more interested in playing it safe, unwilling to ruffle the feathers of his corporate sponsors and brands.<br /> <br /> By wearing the shirt he was making a statement just like his signature  tomahawk  dunk. However, his post-game press conference offered a different sound byte -- echoing his 2011 NBA Finals appearance. He was fading into the corner, scared to bring out the brute presence and talent he casts on his opponents on the court. He backtracked, only looking at the killings of unarmed black men from a surface-level perspective. One can't wave the baton of injustice and represent the voice of the unheard yet retract his or her true sentiments when under judgment and pressure from others. <br /> <br /> James knows that by wearing the shirt, he was carrying the weight of a culture and a community that is systemically treated as inferior through the education system, the prison-industrial complex, etc. To James' credit, he has been very vocal on a number of social issues, most notably on the Trayvon Martin killing when he and his then-teammates <a href= http://grantland.com/features/trayvon-martin-miami-heat-talk-talk-hoodies/  target= _hplink >posed for a photo with their hoodies covering their heads</a>. He is widely admired in is hometown of Akron, Ohio, as a person who constantly gives back to his community and leads by example. <br /> <br /> However, in this particular instance James dodged. Toward the end of his post-game press conference, one of the reporters asked James if there was a larger message, beyond what he'd just said, that should be considered. Sounding almost frustrated, James responded,  How much larger can it be than to just pay respects to the family?  <br /> <br /> LeBron James usually expresses his opinions on social issues, particularly those dealing with his own community, a little bit better. But in this one instance, I hope he will revisit his perspective. "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 00:25:53 -0500"	"sports"
"Babe Lincoln, Amelia Armheart, Ruth Hater Ginsburg : Ladies Who Arm Wrestle"	"<em><a href= http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/12/03/katrina_arnold_photographs_new_orleans_ladies_arm_wrestling_tournaments.html  target= _hplink >This post originally appeared on Slate.<br /> </a></em><strong>By Jordan G. Teicher</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt= arm  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387510/thumbs/o-ARM-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>The Cosmic Crusher and Grandmaw Foots face off in the final match.</small><br /> </center><br /> <br /> When Katrina Arnold photographed a ladies arm wrestling brawl in New Orleans a few years ago, she was instantly hooked. The raucous events, which are hosted by <a href= http://nolaw.org/  target= _hplink >New Orleans Ladies Arm Wrestling</a>, combine the performative, athletic elements of a WWE match with the communal, boozy aspects of a trivia night. It’s one of more than 25 chapters across the world under the umbrella of the<a href= http://www.clawusa.org/the-leagues/  target= _hplink > Collective of Lady Arm Wrestlers. </a><br /> <br /> “They're such colorful events. You never know what's going to happen,” Arnold said. “I got addicted. I ended up joining the collective and taking pictures of my friends.”<br /> <br /> At NOLAW’s events, which are held a few times a year at bars, galleries, and other spaces across the city, eight arm wrestlers—each with their own costumed persona, theme song, and entourage—compete before hundreds of spectators. According to NOLAW, “rules are determined and managed by the referee, only to be manipulated and corrupted by celebrity judges, crowd hecklers, and dolla billz.”<br /> <br /> The events aren’t just fun and games. They’re also fundraisers, with all proceeds benefiting local groups supporting women and children. (The groups, in return, create the winner’s trophy and submit a member to wrestle in the tournament.)<br /> <br /> Photographing arm wrestling, Arnold said, is like photographing a concert: It involves shooting fast-moving subjects in low light, as well as avoiding getting in the way of audience members. Still, she said, NOLAW’s events are “a photographer’s dream.” Hilarious wrestler alter egos—Babe Lincoln, Amelia Armheart, Ruth Hater Ginsburg—come with equally outrageous costumes and stunts as they prepare to compete. Half-time acts include drag queens and burlesque dancers. Crowds are loud and enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> “We want to create a fun, safe atmosphere where we can show off these strong, empowered women doing something that allows them to act out however they want,” she said. “You can be sexy, strong funny—you create a character. The best part is seeing these expressions come out on stage. It's more about performance than the actual arm wrestling.”<br /> <br /> Arnold’s photographs will be on display in the exhibition, “Katrina Arnold: Wrists Up” at New Orleans’ Gradoux Gallery as part of PhotoNOLA from Dec. 4 through Dec. 7.<br /> <br /> <em><a href= http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/12/03/katrina_arnold_photographs_new_orleans_ladies_arm_wrestling_tournaments.html  target= _hplink >See more photos on Slate.</a></em> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 21:10:25 -0500"	"sports"
"Adrian Peterson's Appeal Denied, Arbitrator Upholds NFL's Suspension"	"Adrian Peterson won't likely be back in an NFL game any time soon.

The suspension stemmed from a child injury case involving Peterson and his 4-year-old son. Peterson was <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/adrian-peterson-child-injury-indicted_n_5813210.html  target= _hplink >indicted in September</a> and eventually <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/adrian-peterson-child-abuse-plea_n_6102284.html  target= _hplink >pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge</a> of reckless assault for using a wooden switch to discipline the child.<br /> <br /> Henderson's decision to uphold the NFL's suspension means that Peterson cannot apply for reinstatement until April 15, 2015. <br /> <br /> The <a href= https://twitter.com/NFLPA/status/543534419815182336  target= _hplink >NFL Players Association issued a statement</a> shortly after the decision was announced, taking issue with the ruling and choice of a <a href= http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/11/21/union-questions-harold-hendersons-neutrality/  target= _hplink >former league executive</a> as arbitrator in the case. <br /> <br /> <blockquote>The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL. The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.</blockquote><br /> <br /> Peterson's next move could be to take his appeal to federal court, <a href= https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/543530591065751552  target= _hplink >reported Ian Rapoport of NFL.com</a>. <br /> <br /> <strong>MORE FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: </strong><br /> <br /> <blockquote>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An arbiter appointed by the NFL ruled Friday that Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson will remain suspended until at least next spring in the child-abuse case that has sidelined him for all but one game this season.<br /> <br /> The decision by Harold Henderson, a former league official, upheld the NFL's decision last month to suspend Peterson without pay for the remainder of the season and not consider him for reinstatement before April 15.<br /> <br /> Peterson was paid during his appeal, but Henderson's ruling means Peterson will forfeit checks from the team's last six games. That amounts to a fine of more than $4.1 million.<br /> <br /> The NFL Players Association called Henderson's objectivity into question and said it was  considering immediate legal remedies  to the decision.<br /> <br />  The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL,  the union said in a statement.  The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. <br /> <br /> The Vikings declined to comment. Peterson is a three-time, first-team Associated Press All-Pro and reached the Pro Bowl in six of his first seven NFL seasons, all with Minnesota. Peterson led the NFL in rushing twice, including 2012 when his 2,097 yards fell 9 short of breaking Eric Dickerson's all-time record, but he may never play again for the Vikings after this mess.<br /> <br /> Peterson was charged with felony child abuse in September for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son, but he pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault in November. He had been on paid leave, on a special exempt list at the discretion of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, while his case moved through the court system.<br /> <br /> <br /> At the crux of the NFLPA's argument for reinstatement was what NFL executive vice president for football operations Troy Vincent told Peterson last month when the dispute was at its height. According to a person with knowledge of the conversation, Vincent told Peterson he would receive a two-game ban if he attended a hearing on Nov. 14 with Goodell.<br /> <br /> Peterson declined to meet that day with Goodell, citing uncertainty about the NFL's intent to question him. Goodell then announced on Nov. 18 that Peterson would be suspended for the six games that remained for the Vikings at the time and not be considered for reinstatement until April.<br /> <br /> A recording and a transcript of what Vincent told Peterson was presented by the NFLPA to Henderson, who oversaw a hearing on Dec. 2. Peterson attended that and listened via telephone as the hearing continued on Dec. 4, when Vincent was questioned.<br /> <br /> The union and league have been sniping at each other over the personal-conduct policy since former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice's case eventually prompted Goodell to upgrade the penalty for a first offense of assault, battery or domestic violence to a six-game suspension. After first suspending Rice for two games, Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely amid a national furor over his initial leniency.<br /> <br /> Rice's appeal, however, went to a neutral arbiter who ruled in his favor and reinstated him.<br /> <br /> Peterson injured his son when the boy visited him in May at his home in the Houston area. Peterson acknowledged physically disciplining the boy as he had been as a youth, but said he meant no harm and was sorry for the trouble he caused. Peterson reached a no-contest plea agreement in Texas on Nov. 4, reducing the charge to misdemeanor reckless assault for probation time, community service and a small fine.<br /> <br />  I love my son more than any of you can imagine,  he said outside the courthouse that day.<br /> <br /> The Vikings (6-7) have three games remaining. They initially announced Peterson would stay on the active roster after the first game he missed following the indictment on Sept. 13, but they reversed course less than two days later following intense public pressure and placed him on the exempt list.<br /> <br /> Peterson's current contract runs through 2017, but that's not guaranteed like the other major sports. The Vikings could release him before next season and owe him nothing and take only a $2.4 million hit on their 2015 salary cap, the remaining prorated portion of the signing bonus he received on Sept. 10, 2011.</blockquote> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 18:33:41 -0500"	"sports"

"Five Wins in a Row, Manchester United Week 15 Recap"	"Coming into the weekend matchup, Manchester United, sitting in fourth place, played third place Southampton. Southampton was one point ahead of the Red Devils, but currently in a big slide from their early season form, with two losses and a draw in their last three matches. United were keen on taking advantage of Southampton's poor form and extending their winning streak to five games in a row.<br /> <br /> United fielded another new compilation of players due to their serious bout with injuries, but this time they played in Van Gaal's desired 3-5-2 formation.  David De Gea started in goal. Center backs Chris Smalling, Marcos Rojo, and Paddy McNair formed the three-man backline. Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia adopted left and right wingback positions, respectively. Juan Mata, Michael Carrick, and Marouane Fellaini formed the central midfield, and Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie were the front men. They faced a Southampton side, recently beleaguered with injuries as well, missing key midfielders Morgan Schneiderlin and Jack Cork. <br /> <br /> Southampton jumped out to a wonderful start, controlling the game's tempo and a majority of the possession. The possession, however, lead to few early chances and the game remained a draw at 0-0. A lapse in their defense would prove key in the game's first offensive chance.  After, a Wayne Rooney dribble was edged out by the defense, defender, Jose Fonte, played a back pass to his goalkeeper without looking to assure the pass was open. Robin Van Persie, observant of the defender's mistake, broke into a sprint, stealing the pass before it reached the keeper. With his second touch, he passed the ball through the keeper's legs and into the net. United were up 1-0 in the 12th minute. Shortly after, some worry arose for United. Chris Smalling sat down on the field, unable to continue. Jonny Evans replaced Smalling just 18 minutes into the match. <br /> <br /> Southampton did not let the goal stymy their efforts; in fact, they set about getting an equalizer with renewed purpose. To make matters even worse for United, the new back line played even more nervous. In the 31st minute, they were rewarded. After, a dangerous dribble into the United box and deflections in front of the goal, the ball fell to Southampton forward Graziano Pelle. He drove the ball past David De Gea for the game's equalizer. The goal was David De Gea's only blemish all game as he continued his spectacular form throughout the remaining minutes, especially on another Pelle chance, which he parried wide of the goal. In the 35th minute, Paddy McNair made an error on a clearance, hitting it far short and into a dangerous position right in front of Southampton winger, Shane Long. Long sent the resulting chance far over the bar, but the mistake provided manager Louis Van Gaal enough reason to substitute the youngster a few minutes later for Ander Herrera. Herrera entered the game with several instructions to reshape the United side, including a pivotal swap of Michael Carrick from midfield to defense. The instructions were not delivered clearly and through the remainder of the first half, United played confused and extremely nervous, barely able to see the 1-1 draw through to half.<br /> <br /> United returned more confident from the halftime, but the game's pulse was still driven by Southampton's play. They still controlled possession and the attempts to get into scoring positions. David De Gea came up big again with a tremendous save on a Shane Long header. United would need another Southampton mistake to make an imprint on the game. In the 71st minute, their moment arrived. They received a free kick for a needless foul. Wayne Rooney stood over the ball and curled a magically weighted ball toward the right post and even more, towards Robin Van Persie. He volleyed the ball with the outside of his left foot straight down in between the goalie's legs again. With that touch, United retook the lead.<br /> <br /> De Gea faced another chance from Pelle in the 76th minute, which he repelled skillfully away from any Southampton players seeking a rebound tap-in to equalize.  With some strict attention to defense, United were able to finish the game without conceding and grab the three points needed to place them in 3rd place, 5 points shy of 2nd place, and 8 shy of 1st. <br /> <br /> United will ride high on the result of the match against Southampton, but should be cautious of their actual form in the victory. The defense and midfield looked nervous in defense and possession and their forward line got few touches as a result. Robin Van Persie turned in another sparkling performance, which could signal his return to 2012 form.  David De Gea contributed another gem as goalkeeper.  Paddy McNair's prompt substitution could jostle his confidence, although Van Gaal insinuates a mutual understanding between the two that it will not. United add Chris Smalling to their long list of injured players, including Ángel Di María, Luke Shaw, Daley Blind, Rafael, Phil Jones, and Jesse Lingard. Still, United must press on and continue their winning run. United will play Liverpool next in a rivalry match of the Premiership's two most historically successful teams on Sunday, December 14th. The game will be aired on NBC Sports Network at 8:30AM EST. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 17:38:47 -0500"	"sports"
"Obama Opts For ESPN Over Cable News In The Morning"	"President Barack Obama does not start his mornings off by devouring the latest political headlines from CNN, Fox News or MSNBC. No, the president gets enough of that during the day. Instead, like so many American's seeking solace from reports of war, disease and government gridlock, Obama turns to ESPN.  <br /> <br /> On Friday, during an interview with Colin Cowherd on ESPN Radio's  The Herd,  the president -- between plugging the Affordable Care Act and mentioning the importance of professional athletes speaking out on critical issues -- made sure he let listeners know just how much he loves watching sports. <br /> <br /> “I spend most of my time watching ESPN in the morning,” Obama said, adding that he watches  Sports Center  while working out. “I get so much politics I don’t want to be inundated with a bunch of chatter about politics during the day.”<br /> <br /> In October, former White House press secretary <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/27/jay-carney-obama-cable-news-printed-word_n_6054190.html  target= _hplink >Jay Carney divulged</a> that Obama doesn't bother watching the big cable news channels, but he somehow failed to mention that  Sports Center  makes up the majority of the president's morning news diet.

"Marathon Man: Will Boston Billy Rodgers Ever Stop Running?"	"Just 40 years ago, when Bill Rodgers won his first Boston Marathon, running was considered a bizarre thing to do. Truckers threw beer cans at runners' heads.  <br /> <br /> Employers wouldn't let workers go for a run at lunchtime.  Women seldom ran marathons and were barely welcome at the Boston. <br /> <br /> Marathons lacked mile markers, water stops, and porta-potties, and... runners.  The '75 Boston featured only 2,000 runners, compared with 30,000 today.  <br /> <br /> Back then, the New York City Marathon consisted of four loops inside Central Park.  And Nike was barely a waffle-shaped gleam in the eye of Phil Knight.  <br /> <br /> Suddenly, a handful of long distance runners -- Frank Shorter, Jim Fixx, Alberto Salazar, Jack Fultz, and Bill Rodgers -- captured the nation's imagination and inspired the running boom which continues to this day.<br /> <br /> Rodgers, one of America's most beloved athletes, and still a free spirit at 67, has just written a memoir, <em>Marathon Man</em>, describing his experiences training for and winning the 1975 Boston Marathon.  <br /> <br /> He wore a pair of ill-fitting running proto-Nikes he'd received in the mail from his friend, fellow legend Steve Prefontaine, and once he knew he had the race in the bag, around mile 20, he actually stopped running to tie his shoe.<br /> <br /> Rodgers spoke to me about how marathoning has changed over the years, and how marathoning changed his life.<br /> <br /> <strong>What makes the Boston Marathon unique?<br /> </strong><br /> It is more fun than any other race, and it's a race that people want to do over and over.  I hate to use the word addictive, but there is something different about Boston.  It's the oldest yearly marathon in the world.  Maybe it's because Boston isn't as big as New York, Chicago, or L.A., so it fits the city a little bit better.  It overtakes the city.  I've met a lot of runners over the years who say,  My father ran the marathon,  or even  My grandfather ran the marathon.   I love that.<br /> <br /> <strong>The weather's so unpredictable.  You can be running in thirty-mile-an-hour headwinds, you can be running in ninety-degree heat. <br /> </strong><br /> That's part of the charm of Boston -- you don't know what you're going to get.  That's the way all marathons were, but now they're all geared for faster times and cooler weather.  New York was in September, then late October, and now it's the first week of November.  Tokyo is in February.  Berlin is in late September.   <br /> <br /> Boston hasn't changed, which is charming -- but when you're running it, it might not be so charming.  Race directors want to attract the maximum number of entrants, and the thing that attracts people to a race is making it as easy as possible to set a new personal best.  There's a push to make the marathon an easier event, which is smart.  I ran New York when it was in September.  It was ninety degrees!  That's why marathon running was not very popular. <br /> <br /> <strong>When you knew you had the '75 Boston won, about six miles from the finish line, you actually stopped running to tie your shoe.<br /> </strong><br /> That's true.  I wish I knew exactly where it was.  I had fun at Boston.  It became my favorite race.  I can remember thinking that if I could win and get that medal, it would be so great.  What's unique about Boston is that everyone has that feeling.  <br /> <br /> Running is more than a sport.  A sport is just a sport -- just a win or a loss.  This is ten trillion times more.  Everyone struggles at Boston, which is maybe why that medal means so much.  <br /> <br /> <strong>In Marathon Man you talk about eating a lot of sweets and junk food as part of your training regimen.<br /> </strong><br /> It was just a sign of the times.  When we were traveling from race to race, we'd go back to a hotel afterwards and our celebration was getting a big bowl of nuts or chips with cheese.  We didn't think about nutrition like the professional runners today.  Frank Shorter and I were a little bit closer to the earlier Boston Marathon winners, the Johnny Kelleys and Clarence Demars, than to runners of the present day. <br /> <br /> My diet today is a little healthier than it used to be, but I still like my snacks, pumpkin pies, and all that.  I think people just know more now, which has played a role in runners getting quicker and helping more people to become runners. <br /> <br /> <strong>When you were training for the 1975 Boston Marathon, you were able to incorporate running into a fairly normal existence -- you had a full-time job and a girlfriend.<br /> </strong><br /> One of the myths about running is that you can't live a normal life if you're going to be a marathoner.  I think to some extent that for elite runners, that's true.  Their lives are kind of severe.  <br /> <br /> Back then we were winging it.  We ran a lot of miles, but we had a lot of fun too.  We ate what we wanted.  Grabbing a bunch of chocolate chip cookies after dinner and having them for dessert was part of the game.  That's probably not true for today's elite runners.     <br /> <br /> <strong>Do you miss the purity of the sport? Is there something that's lost with the commercialization of it, and the popularization?<br /> </strong><br /> It's not lost if the race leadership doesn't want it to get lost.  The race directors in Boston are handling the competitive racing side very well for the professional runners, but they've also kept a place for the Johnny Kelleys of today, the amateurs who run because they love to.  The door got wider, especially when the fundraising side came in and when women came into the sport.  <br /> <br /> Women made it a family sport.<br /> <br /> Today we have the Rock 'n' Roll Marathons, so there's more of a fun side to the sport, and that's very powerful.  Sports have definitely changed, but the Boston course is always the same.  That's what I like about Boston.  When you run Boston's course, you ran where Greta Weitz ran -- and Joan Benoit, Ingrid Kristiansen, and Clarence DeMar.<br /> <br /> <strong>And you.<br /> </strong><br /> That's true.<br /> <br /> <strong>When you won in '75, your  prize  was a bowl of beef stew.<br /> </strong><br /> I remember when they were debating about whether to have prize money at the Boston Marathon.  I talked to Tommy Leonard, the founder of the Falmouth Road Race, and said,  Oh, it should be wide open.  They shouldn't have qualifying times unless 100,000 people want to run.   There's a tremendous sum of good that comes out of the marathon.  Every runner has a story.<br /> <br /> <strong>How do you feel about the fundraising aspect of marathoning? <br /> </strong><br /> The fundraising side has turned out to be absolutely spectacular.  Not too long ago, no one would have thought that someone would put money forward for a runner to run a marathon.  It would be a joke -- like George Plimpton running the Boston Marathon.  Running a marathon is a great challenge, a quest, but people say to themselves,  I can complete it because I'm doing it to fight cancer or Alzheimer's disease.   Everyone has a personal reason to be there, and that's powerful.   <br /> <br /> When I travel to races around the country, people tell me that they don't think they'll ever be able to run the Boston Marathon, or that they can't run fast enough to qualify.  I say,  Yes, you can.  You just have to link up with an organization that you have a connection with.  For example, everyone has a connection to fighting cancer. <br /> <br /> Running is the number one sport for individual fundraising.  Football, baseball, and golf are all very charitable, but that's all on the corporate level.  When it comes to charitable giving, running might be bigger, partly because running is more global than almost any sport.  All of these cool things are happening now, which makes it a better sport than ever.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Do you still attend the Boston Marathon?<br /> </strong><br /> I still go in for the race, and I love it.  It's one of my favorite days.  It's like all the holidays combined.  It's just so much fun to see everyone smiling at a marathon.  Everyone is in a good mood.  Maybe they're struggling a little at the end, but people are smiling.  They're with their family and friends.  It's hard to beat. <br /> <br /> There are more of us older runners than ever before.  I love that, but I also love to see the young people in their twenties.  American youth are often criticized, but they're running marathons and they're raising funds.  I love seeing that. <br /> <br /> <strong>Tell me why you wrote Marathon Man.<br /> </strong><br /> When I initially spoke with my coauthor, Matt Shepatkin, I was a little bit nervous.  I said,  No one's going to want to read this.   He is not a runner.  It was funny as heck, because he had no knowledge of intervals, speed work, or Heartbreak Hill, but he was a very good writer, and we had a lot of fun.  <br /> <br /> I've gotten a lot of great feedback about the book.  I like that we included running with my brothers Charlie and Jason.  That's what it is really about -- becoming a runner.  You might quit if you don't have a focus or if you don't run with your family or friends.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Before the running boom you helped create, running was disrespected.<br /> </strong><br /> I was a special education teacher so that I could have time to train for Boston.  My first year, they wouldn't even let me run on my lunch hour.  My second year, they said yes.  That enabled me to make the Olympic team.  <br /> <br /> Olympic sports, like cycling, running, and swimming, are changing our society and I think employers see that now.  They are building bike paths around their corporate parks and encourage basketball or walking.  It's great.<br /> <br /> I think running is changing.  It's a lifestyle sport, it's a lifetime sport, and it's a health and fitness sport.  Plus, if you're active, you sleep better, food tastes better; life is better in so many ways. <br /> <br /> <strong>Are there more marathons in you?  <br /> </strong> <br /> For years, I would run every race I went to, but now it's more about going to the expo at each race, where I meet the runners.  Since I'm older and have been at races so long, I don't want to run every race.  I get almost as much out of it by seeing the runners go by.  When I was at Philadelphia, Mayor Nutter actually gave high fives to all 30,000 runners. <br /> <br /> A lot of my friends still train for Boston, but most of them are younger.  From age 25 to age 40, I did 50 marathons.  That's a lot of traveling and racing.  When I hit 40, I did some more marathons, but I started to lose my drive for it.  As you get older, everything shifts gears.  You start to say,  Well, I'll do a half marathon, and that's my marathon now.   You start thinking of your health, and you want to back off a little.   <br /> <br /> During the first running boom, we didn't keep it moderate.  That caused some runners a lot of wear and tear.  Even the professional runners today don't race as much as Frank Shorter and I raced back in the seventies and early eighties.  The fastest older runners today are people who came into the sport later in their lives, not Frank Shorter or me.  We have too many miles on our bodies, though I think maybe I should do Boston this year because the desire for it never goes away.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Today, runners run fewer miles and do more cross training.<br /> </strong><br /> There's definitely more knowledge and awareness of cross training, and I think that's good for us older runners, too.  We're the first generation of older people who are trying to stay fit, though we aren't necessarily marathoning or doing Ironmans.  <br /> <br /> Most people aren't active.  They don't even walk!  They have jobs that are too much for them and take up too many hours, so they can't find the time to run.  They think,  This'll just make me more tired,  or they were never chosen for a sports team, so they don't believe they can be an athlete. <br /> To me, you're an athlete if you try, but you need a boost.  Take a look at our sports teams: eight, ten, twelve people per side.  Just a few people!  That leaves everyone else!  You have to figure out what you want to do, and explore it.  Now people are finding out what they love, and for more and more people, it's long-distance running.  <br /> <br /> <strong>What happens to people when they commit to running a marathon?<br /> </strong><br /> You change when you become a runner.  Think of those 25-year-olds -- they've got a journey ahead.  They're seeing all of the older runners out there, and that's got to be mindboggling to them.  I think it is such a cool thing that kids can see their parents run, and vice versa.  It wasn't like that thirty years ago.  You didn't often see parents running with their kids. <br /> <br /> If I had a part in people finding this quest for themselves, that's great.  At a marathon, we all cheer for each other, which is pretty cool. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 15:56:27 -0500"	"sports"

"Kobe Bryant Has Every Right To Be Upset With Laker Teammates"	"When Kobe Bryant talks, we listen. That's what five NBA titles and a league MVP get you. As a result, it became national news when the 36-year-old Bryant was caught on camera going after his teammates for a lackluster effort during practice.  Soft,  he called them.<br /> <br /> <img alt= kobe  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386394/thumbs/r-KOBE-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> The current Los Angeles Lakers roster is part has-been and part never-was, along with some players who belong in the D-League. It is a sad reminder of the state of an organization associated with championships and excellence. And it didn't help that Bryant's remarks came on the heels of the franchise's most famous and beloved player ever, Magic Johnson, going on record wishing that the team would lose the rest of its games.<br /> <br />  I hope the Lakers lose every game,  <a href= http://espn.go.com/losangeles/nba/story/_/id/12005550/magic-johnson-says-hopes-los-angeles-lakers-lose-every-game  target= _hplink >Johnson said</a>.  Because if you're going to lose, lose. And I'm serious. <br /> <br /> Bryant was right. As I <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jordan-schultz/kobe-bryant_b_6035458.html?utm_hp_ref=the-schultz-report  target= _hplink >tried to convey before the season began</a>, his prolific scoring prowess is going nowhere. And yet the lack of effort by a talented yet enigmatic scorer like Nick Young is appalling. So when Young started blabbering about being the best one-on-one player in the world, it's no surprise that Bryant lit him up.<br /> <br /> Here's a thought for Nick Young: Who cares? What difference does it make? Your team is 6-16 and the laughingstock of not just the Western Conference but the whole NBA. Young, even with his dynamic scoring ability, is at best a sideshow clown without a winning nature who consistently makes losing plays.   <br /> <br />  I think Nick probably regrets getting me started at practice and saying something,  <a href= http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/12016979/los-angeles-lakers-star-kobe-bryant-critical-teammates-heated-scrimmage  target= _hplink >Bryant said</a>.<br /> <br /> <img alt= nick young  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386416/thumbs/r-NICK-YOUNG-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> Bryant, because he can't help himself, will find a way to give a Herculean effort, even in losses. He is a mere 30 points behind the incomparable Michael Jordan to become the third-leading scorer in league history. He has been in the NBA over half his life and genuinely doesn't know how to go less than 100 percent. The problem is that the Nick Youngs and Jordan Hills of the world don't understand such a concept. <br /> <br /> Whether or not GM Mitch Kupchak fields a capable roster in Bryant's final years -- the Lakers will have cap room for max contracts -- remains to be seen. What we do know, however, is that No. 24 will not stand for mediocrity, even when his teammates will.<br /> <br /> Head coach Byron Scott summed it up:  Any time (No.) 24 practices,  he said,  it's going to be an intense practice. I think he brings out the best in the guys. It's a good way to start the trip. ... I don't think anything irritated him. I just think he did a great job of getting everyone else fired up. He's always fired up. That's the great thing about him. <br /> <br /> The fact that he's the only one fired up is the not-so-great thing about the rest of this team.<br /> <br /> <em>Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at <a href= https://twitter.com/Schultz_Report >@Schultz_Report</a>, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.

"Dark Matter Signal May Have Been Found In Mysterious X-Ray Data"	"After a decades-long search, astronomers may finally have found the <a href= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-12/epfd-rdp121114.php  target= _hplink >first sign of dark matter</a>. That's the <a href= http://home.web.cern.ch/about/physics/dark-matter  target= _hplink >invisible substance that scientists believe makes up the bulk of our universe</a>, since visible matter accounts for only about 20 percent of our universe's mass. <br /> <br /> While scientists can observe dark matter indirectly by looking at its gravitational effects on visible matter, they have struggled to come up with tangible evidence that proves the stuff exists--until now. <br /> <br /> This week, a team of researchers from Switzerland and the Netherlands announced that they may have detected the signal of decaying dark matter particles. <br /> <br /> For the research, the team analyzed the x-rays emitted from two celestial objects: the <a href= http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2014/perseus/  target= _hplink >Perseus galaxy cluster</a>, an array of galaxies located approximately 250 million light years from Earth, and our <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy  target= _hplink > sister  galaxy Andromeda</a>, which is approximately 2.5 million light years away. The researchers looked at data collected by the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope and spotted a mysterious  anomaly  that could not have been emitted by any known atom or particle.<br /> <br /> The <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/x-rays-dark-matter_n_5528961.html  target= _hplink >same strange x-ray spike was also detected</a> by a research team at Harvard in June, who announced they had spotted the emission in data from 70 different galaxy clusters.<br /> <br />  This tiny (several hundred extra photons) excess has been interpreted as originating from very rare decays of dark matter particles,  Dr. Alexey Boyarsky, a professor of physics at Leiden University in the Netherlands and the lead researcher for the new study, told The Huffington Post in an email.  Although the signal is very weak, it has passed several 'sanity checks' that one expects from a decaying dark matter signal. <br /> <br /> For instance, the researchers say the signal was more concentrated in the center and weak at the edges of Andromeda and the Perseus cluster, which corresponds to what they expected. Boyarsky added that the team has now found a signal at the same wave length coming from our own galaxy, the Milky Way.<br /> <br /> Boyarsky and his team believe the signal comes from the decay of a dark matter particle, possibly a  sterile neutrino,  which is a hypothetical particle believed to be <a href= http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2014/02/x-rays-other-galaxies-could-emanate-particles-dark-matter  target= _hplink >1/100th the size of an electron</a>. <br /> <br />  Confirmation of this discovery may lead to construction of new telescopes specially designed for studying the signals from dark matter particles,  Boyarsky said in a written statement.  We will know where to look in order to <a href= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-12/epfd-rdp121114.php  target= _hplink >trace dark structures in space</a> and will be able to reconstruct how the Universe has formed. <br /> <br /> The research is scheduled to be published next week in the journal Physical Review Letters.

"Research Links Addictive Social Media Behavior With Substance Abuse"	"Plenty of research has demonstrated that the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-judson-brewer/social-media-addiction_b_4079697.html  target= _hplink >addictive quality of social media</a> is very real. And according to a new study, heavy social media use may also contribute to a different type of addiction. <br /> <br /> Psychologists at the University of Albany found that not only is social media (particularly Facebook) itself potentially addictive, those who use it may also be at greater risk for impulse-control issues like substance abuse. <br /> <br /> The researchers surveyed 253 undergraduate students, asking questions about their social media use, Internet addiction, emotion regulation and alcohol use. They found that roughly 10 percent of users experience  disordered social media use,  meaning that they exhibit addictive behaviors in the way they use platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. To assess disordered social media use, the researchers included questions that reflected modified diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, such as,  How good does Facebook make you feel?  and  Do you check Facebook first thing when you wake up in the morning?  <br /> <br /> Those who were struggling with social media addiction were more likely to report Internet addiction (as measured by scores on the <a href= http://netaddiction.com/internet-addiction-test/  target= _hplink >Young Internet Addiction Test</a>), challenges with emotion regulation (such as poor impulse control), and drinking problems. <br /> <br /> Psychologist Julia Hormes, who led the study, said that Facebook was found to have especially addictive properties. The respondents spent an average of one-third of their online browsing time on Facebook, and 67 percent received Facebook push notifications on their phones.  <br /> <br />  New notifications or the latest content on your newsfeed acts as a reward. Not being able to predict when new content is posted encourages us to check back frequently,  <a href= http://www.albany.edu/news/56604.php  target= _hplink >Hormes said in a statement</a>.  This uncertainty about when a new reward is available is known as a 'variable interval schedule of reinforcement' and is highly effective in establishing habitual behaviors that are resistant to extinction. Facebook is also making it easy for users to continuously be connected to its platform, for example by offering push notifications to mobile devices. <br /> <br /> The researchers hypothesize that disordered social media use is likely a symptom of poor emotion regulation skills, which heightens susceptibility to a variety of types of addiction. <br /> <br /> “Our findings suggest that disordered online social networking may arise as part of a cluster of risk factors that increase susceptibility to both substance and non-substance addictions,” <a href= http://www.albany.edu/news/56604.php  target= _hplink >Hormes said</a>. <br /> <br /> The new findings join a growing body of research investigating the addictive potential of Internet social media use. MRI data has shown that the brains of compulsive Internet users to <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/30/shocking-ways-internet-rewires-brain_n_4136942.html  target= _hplink >exhibit similar changes </a>to those seen in people with alcohol and drug addictions. Harvard <a href= http://www.pnas.org/content/109/21/8038.abstract  target= _hplink >research conducted in 2012</a> provided some insight into why using Facebook in particular seems to be so highly addictive. Disclosing information about ourselves, the researchers found, is intrinsically rewarding. It activates the Nucleas Accumbens, a brain area that also lights up when cocaine or other drugs are ingested. But it's not just posting on Facebook that's addictive -- it's also receiving all those likes and comments. Another study found that receiving <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-judson-brewer/social-media-addiction_b_4079697.html  target= _hplink >positive feedback about ourselves</a> also activates the brain's reward centers. <br /> <br /> However, Hormes' and other research can't be taken as conclusive evidence that disordered social media use constitutes a full-blown addiction. <br /> <br />  The question of whether or not disordered online social networking use can be considered a 'true' addiction is a tough one,  Hormes said in an email to the Huffington Post.  I think the answer really depends on your definition of 'addiction.' Many people think of addictions as involving ingested substances. However, if we think about addiction more broadly as involving some kind of reward then it is easier to see how behaviors may be addictive. <br /> <br /> The new findings were published in the December issue of the journal <em>Addiction</em>.

"Bill Nye: Creationism Is 'Raising A Generation Of Young People Who Can't Think'"	"The biggest danger creationism plays, according to Bill Nye the  Science Guy,  is that it is raising a generation of children who  can't think   and who  will not be able to participate in the future in same way  as those who are taught evolution.<br /> <br /> Speaking on <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq3CvTP_LHc  target= _hplink >MidPoint</a>, Nye said he blames an older generation of evangelicals  who have very strong conservative views  and who are  reluctant to let kids learn about evolution.  Their <a href= http://www.businessinsider.com/texas-school-board-debate-on-evolution-2013-11  target= _hplink >presence on school boards</a> leads to debates over curriculum, Nye argued, which further inhibits schools' ability to teach facts.<br /> <br />  Religion is one thing. People get tremendous comfort and community with their religions,  Nye said.  But whatever you believe, whatever deity or higher power you might believe in, the Earth is not 6,000 years old.  <br /> <br /> Nye, who has a new book out titled  Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation,  recently participated in a <a href= http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/02/04/271648691/watch-the-creationism-vs-evolution-debate-bill-nye-and-ken-ham  target= _hplink >debate</a> with creationist Ken Ham, which some argued was a moment of embarrassment for the science community.<br /> <br /> University of Chicago evolution professor Jerry A.

"Students Give Professors Better Evaluations If They Think They're Male: Study"	"Students tend to give better evaluations to their professors if they think they're male instead of female, according to <a href= http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4  target= _hplink >a study</a> published last week in the journal Innovative Higher Education.<br /> <br /> The study, led by Lillian MacNell, a doctoral student at North Carolina State University, used an online summer course on introductory anthropology and sociology to, essentially, <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfish_%28film%29  target= _hplink >catfish</a> students. The class was divided into four discussion groups, with two assistant instructors, one male and one female, teaching two discussions groups each. The assistant instructors collaborated to write and teach in similar ways. <br /> <br /> However, the male instructor only told one of his groups that he was male, and told his other group he was female. Likewise, the female instructor only told one group she was female, and told her other group she was male.<br /> <br /> At the end of the course, students were asked to fill out an evaluation about their instructor. Overall, the instructors did not receive significantly different evaluations. But the female instructor received better evaluations when students thought she was male. The male instructor, meanwhile, received worse evaluations when students thought he was female.<br /> <br /> <script id= infogram_0_mean-of-student-ratings---male  src= //e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?64g  type= text/javascript ></script><div style= width:100%;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center; ><a target= _blank  href= https://infogr.am/mean-of-student-ratings---male  style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none; >Mean of Student Ratings - Male Instructor</a> |<a style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;  href= https://infogr.am  target= _blank >Create infographics</a></div><br /> <br /> <script id= infogram_0_mean-of-student-ratings---female-instructor  src= //e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?i1m  type= text/javascript ></script><div style= width:100%;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center; ><a target= _blank  href= https://infogr.am/mean-of-student-ratings---female-instructor  style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none; >Mean of Student Ratings - Female Instructor</a> |<a style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;  href= https://infogr.am  target= _blank >Create infographics</a></div><br /> <br /> <br /> The evaluations also included specific questions about how the instructor performed, and the responses to these questions reveal an even deeper bias. Both instructors returned grades to their students after two days. But when students were asked to rate their instructors on promptness, instructors perceived as male received an average rating of 4.35 out of 5, while instructors perceived as females received an average rating of only 3.55.<br /> <br /> Male-perceived instructors also scored higher on questions about interpersonal measures, even though, according to the study,  both actual instructors demonstrated the same level of interpersonal interaction in their attempts to create a sense of immediacy in the online classroom.  The researchers theorized that female instructors are generally expected to have high interpersonal skills -- meaning that a female instructor would have to work harder than a male instructor just to get the same rating.<br /> <br /> The study argues that if these biases are coming across so clearly in teacher evaluations,  this particular form of inequality needs to be taken into consideration as women apply for academic jobs and come up for promotion and review.

"Men Do The Dumbest Things, According To Science"	"The next time you call the man in your life an “idiot,” know that science — if not compassion — is on your side. <br /> <br /> A new tongue-in-cheek analysis published in the typically offbeat Christmas edition of the distinguished <a href= http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7094  target= _hplink >British Medical Journal</a> examined <a href= http://www.darwinawards.com/rules/  target= _hplink >winners of the Darwin Awards</a> -- a dubious prize given to those among us who have injured ourselves or even perished due to, uh, poor risk assessment skills. They found that 88.7 percent of the  winners  were male.<br /> <br /> On the other hand, the clever person who came up with this study is himself a man -- or close: 15-year-old <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/local/wp/2014/12/12/british-medical-journal-men-really-can-be-idiots/  target= _hplink >Ben Alexander Daniel Lendrem from Newcastle, U.K.</a>, conceived and carried out the analysis with his statistician father, Dennis Lendrem, reports The Washington Post. <br /> <br /> The Lendrems defined idiotic risks as “senseless... where the apparent payoff is negligible or non-existent, and the outcome is often extremely negative and often final. <br /> <br />  According to 'male idiot theory' (MIT) many of the differences in risk seeking behavior, emergency department admissions, and mortality may be explained by the observation that men are idiots and idiots do stupid things,” explained the study authors.  In this paper we present evidence in support of this hypothesis using data on idiotic behaviors demonstrated by winners of the Darwin Award. <br /> <br /> The team ran an analysis of 20 years of Darwin award winners and whittled down the cases to those whose deaths were independently verified were included. Awards shared by men and women (usually “overly adventurous couples,” notes the study) were also left out.<br /> <br /> That left 318 Darwin awards: 282 given to men, and 36 to women. Researchers note that the difference between the sexes is highly statically significant, which means it’s extremely unlikely that this division occurred by chance. Here’s how the study authors distinguish a Darwin-worthy death from a more routine accidental death:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>For instance, Darwin Awards are unlikely to be awarded to individuals who shoot themselves in the head while demonstrating that a gun is unloaded. This occurs too often and is classed as an accident. In contrast, candidates shooting themselves in the head to demonstrate that a gun is loaded may be eligible for a Darwin Award -- such as the man who shot himself in the head with a “spy pen” weapon to show his friend that it was real.</blockquote><br /> <br /> Other examples of Darwin winners include the terrorist who didn’t put enough postage on his package when sending a mail bomb; it was returned to him, and he promptly opened it and perished. Another man attached a shopping cart to the end of a train car, which dragged him to his death. <br /> <br /> Though half in (rather morbid) jest, serious, comprehensive research has also found that men are more apt to take risks and less apt to control their impulses than are women, to damaging effect. This study notes that men are more likely than women to be admitted to hospital emergency rooms after accidental injuries and more likely to be in a traffic collision with a higher mortality rate. <br /> <br /> Of course, even wacky studies have their limitations: Men drink alcohol more than women, which could skew the results. Alternately, idiotic men may idiotically die in a more newsworthy way, which leads them to be nominated for the Darwin awards. Finally, more woman may be nominating men for the award.

Should it be a light and fluffy yeast doughnut or a thicker cake doughnut? Should it have cinnamon sugar, glaze or <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/08/powdered-sugar_n_6289842.html  target= _hplink >powdered sugar</a>? Jelly filled, cream filled or filled with nothing but air, because there's an appropriately sized hole in the middle? Let's not even get started on the cruller. As luck would have it, a mathematician in England has just supposedly identified the <a href= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11284809/Mathematician-creates-formula-for-the-perfect-doughnut.html  target= _hplink >mathematically perfect doughnut</a>. <br /> <br /> The Telegraph reports that Dr. Eugenia Cheng, Senior Lecturer of Pure Mathematics at the University of Sheffield, came up with a  squidgy to crispy ratio  to measure doughnuts and find the ideal one. If you're wondering what  squidgy  means, you're not alone.  <a href= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/squidge  target= _hplink >Squidge</a>  means to squash or crush, so the doughnut's  squidginess  or  squidge factor  refers to how much it squashes in your mouth. (It's also a completely endearing Britishism that makes us wish the English could describe all of our food.)<br /> <br /> <a href= http://metro.co.uk/2014/12/10/maths-reveals-the-secret-to-the-perfect-ring-doughnut-its-to-do-with-the-size-of-the-hole-apparently-4981661/  target= _hplink >Metro UK explains</a> Cheng's formula:  We take the overall volume of the doughnut and then subtract the volume of the squidgy part on the inside, which is itself in the shape of a doughnut, with the same R (radius of doughnut) but smaller r (radius of dough.).  Stay with us. Basically Cheng believes the size of the doughnut hole is critical for affecting the way the doughnut tastes. The smaller the hole, the more squidgy the doughnut, because there's more surface area to squidge and less dead space. A bigger hole makes for a crispier doughnut, because there's less fluffy dough to squash, and less dough will crisp faster. We think that's the idea, anyway.<br /> <br /> The kicker of this whole equation is that it's commissioned by none other than Domino's Pizza. <a href= https://www.dominos.co.uk/  target= _hplink >Domino's UK</a> <a href= http://consumerist.com/2014/12/01/you-can-now-get-hot-doughnuts-from-dominos-in-the-u-k/  target= _hplink >started selling a new line of doughnuts</a> last month, and apparently it hired a scientist to find the ultimate doughnut. Cheng says that the squidgy-to-crispy ratio in Domino's doughnuts is 78:22, because its doughnuts have smaller-than-average holes. Whether or not this particular ratio is  perfect,  and whether or not more squidge equals tastier doughnuts, is, of course, up for debate. <br /> <br /> Judging by appearance alone, the size of the hole in many of America's favorite doughnuts (seen below) -- from the classic to the gourmet -- may not indicate anything at all. Like all great food debates, it would appear that the perfect doughnut is still a completely subjective matter. We're willing to try 'em all though, in the name of science. If anyone gets their hands on Domino's doughnuts in the UK, please tell us how it ranks on a scale of 1 to perfection. <br /> <br /> <HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--389166--HH><br /> <br /> <br><br /> <b><em>Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

"This New Phone App Can Tell When You've Had Too Much To Drink"	"<p>A new federally funded cellphone app allows people who may have had one too many to get an idea just how drunk they are — and hail a ride home.</p><br />               <p>Users enter their sex, height, weight, and number of drinks consumed to help figure out their blood-alcohol level. They also can play two interactive games to test reaction time and cognitive agility. And the app uses GPS technology to call cabs and pre-load phone numbers for potential designated drivers.</p><br />               <p>The app, called ENDUI — pronounced  End DUI  — was announced Thursday by government and police officials in Maryland. Funded by federal money reserved for drunken-driving education efforts, the app is among several in a handful of states to tackle drunken driving — though Maryland's is one of the most elaborate.</p><br />               <p> It's unique,  said Kara Macek, a spokeswoman at the Governors Highway Safety Association, of the new app, which was developed by the Maryland Highway Safety Office for about $50,000. The app was funded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p><br />               <p> I think states are starting to go that route because they're trying to reach consumers where they are and where they spend time, and everyone spends time on their phone,  Macek said.  I think we're going to see more of that as we go forward. </p><br />               <p>States with similar apps include New York, New Mexico, Colorado, and California, which launched its version two weeks ago.</p><br />               <p>Like the other states, Maryland's app is available for free on Android and iPhone.</p><br />               <p>One of the games on the app involves pressing a red  brake  button when an image of a pedestrian passes by or a car ahead stops. The app says just how fast — or slow — users react and how much time their car would have needed to avoid a collision.</p><br />               <p>The other game shows nine road signs that blink in different order; users try to recall the order, which gets increasingly challenging with each round — with or without drinks.</p><br />               <p> The game is meant to be a hook and pull you in,  said Tom Gianni, chief of the Maryland Highway Safety Office.  Then it's meant to give you a lesson of, 'See what can happen. Imagine if you were behind the wheel.' </p><br />               <p>A feature that estimates blood-alcohol levels has users enter their height and weight, and details about what kind and how many drinks they have. For instance, the app estimates that a 130-pound woman who just drank a glass of red wine would have a blood-alcohol level of .04 percent.</p><br />               <p>Though that's under Maryland's legal limit of .08 percent, the app warns that  driving ability is likely to be impaired. </p><br />               <p> Get a cab or have someone that has not been drinking take you home,  the app advises.</p><br />               <p>At nearly every step, the app warns users that no matter what the results,  driving with any amount of alcohol in your system may impair you and be illegal. </p><br />               <p>Gianni called the driving-related features the most important for someone who's been drinking.</p><br />               <p> It kind of takes the guesswork out of a situation where you've had a few drinks and you're not sure what to,  Gianni said.  This takes all the brainwork out of it. </p><br />               <p>____</p><br />               <p>Previous versions of this story incorrectly stated who funded the app. The app was funded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, not the Governors Highway Safety Association.</p> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 14:47:01 -0500"	"science"
"Street Drug 'Special K' May Offer New Hope For People With Treatment-Resistant Depression"	"A hallucinogenic drug known on the street as  Special K  offers new hope to those suffering from severe, treatment-resistant depression. <br /> <br /> Ketamine, which was originally developed in the 1960s as a milder version of PCP, already has a well-established medical use as a sedative or pain killer. But since 2000, <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25426012  target= _hplink >small but high-quality studies</a> have demonstrated its uses as a powerful and fast-acting treatment for major depression. <br /> <br /> The growing body of evidence has emboldened doctors to begin prescribing Ketamine for depression, despite the fact that the drug has not been approved for such a use and the long-term effects are still unknown. To address those unknowns, various pharmaceutical companies are <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/business/special-k-a-hallucinogen-raises-hopes-and-concerns-as-a-treatment-for-depression.html  target= _hplink >formulating their own versions</a> of the drug and testing them in clinical trials, as The New York Times recently reported, but advocates say that the trials are simply an attempt to make money on tweaked versions of a generic drug. <br /> <br /> Ketamine doesn't work like common, widely-used antidepressant medications like Prozac, Zoloft or Lexapro, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that change the <a href= http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825  target= _hplink >balance of the neurotransmitter serotonin</a>. Instead, Ketamine targets receptors of glutamate, an amino acid.<br /> <br /> Scientists first noticed that targeting glutamate had an antidepressant effect more than 50 years ago, when doctors administered a glutamate-modulating antibiotic to tuberculosis patients and saw their moods lift, according to Dr. Robert Howland, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. <br /> <br /> Howland recently published a review of 25 peer-reviewed studies (that had a total of 416 participants) in the journal <a href= http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825  target= _hplink >Neuropharmacology</a> that examined the effects of Ketamine treatment on people with treatment-resistant depression.<br /> <br /> All 25 studies suggested that Ketamine was indeed an  active and rapid antidepressant  for people with treatment-resistant depression (approximately 10 to 20 percent of those who have depression), wrote Howland in his review. Three of those studies even showed that Ketamine appeared to reduce suicidality (suicide ideation) in people treated with the drug. This confirms that glutamate plays an active role in this mental illness, according to Howland. <br /> <br /> But serious questions remain about the drug's long-term effects, as well as its ability to sustain the same levels of antidepressant over time without upping the dose. After all, people can become addicted to  Special K,  and large doses of the drug could cause hallucinations, aggressive or violent behavior and even death from overdose, according to the University of Maryland's <a href= http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/ketamine.asp  target= _hplink >Center for Substance Abuse Research</a>. <br /> <br />  Although limited to initial observations, ketamine may be effective not only in TRD patients but also on suicidality,  concluded Howland in his study review.  However, future studies are recommended in order to test the efficacy of ketamine when compared with other active comparators such as electroconvulsive therapy or antidepressant-antipsychotic drugs combinations.

"Immediately After A Stroke, Your Next Steps Are Crucial"	"<br>By Shereen Lehman</br>                <br>(Reuters Health) - Time is critical when someone has a  stroke, but care can be delayed when victims, bystanders or even  health workers don't recognize the emergency, a new study in the  UK finds.</br>                <br>Better public awareness of the signs of stroke and the  importance of seeking immediate emergency care are needed, the  authors say.</br>                <br/>                <br>Stroke signs include the sudden onset of various symptoms  such as confusion, difficulty speaking, droopy face or slurred  speech, weakness in a limb, numbness, being off-balance, visual  loss or a really severe headache.</br>                <br> Getting to hospital quickly is particularly important for  patients who suffer certain types of stroke, because they can  benefit from clot busting drugs, but only if these are given  within hospital within 4.5 hours of symptoms starting,  Ruth  Mellor, who led the study, told Reuters Health by email.</br>                <br> We knew from earlier research that people who have a stroke  can take a long time to get to hospital and wanted to understand  why that was,  said Mellor, who is a researcher with the  National Health Service Lanarkshire.</br>                <br>Her team interviewed 30 stroke patients to learn about their  decisions and experiences, with an emphasis on the routes that  eventually got them to the hospital for stroke treatment.</br>                <br>All the patients lived in cities. Most were white men, under  age 65. Most strokes occurred at home.</br>                <br>Eighteen patients contacted a health service before going to  the emergency department, but the remaining 12 took more  circuitous routes to the hospital.</br>                <br>Less than half arrived at the emergency department within  three hours of their first symptoms, but no times were recorded  for 11 of the patients, the researchers reported in Annals of  Emergency Medicine.</br>                <br>Delays in getting treatment happened when patients didn't  recognize the severity of their symptoms or decided to contact  their primary care doctor instead of emergency services.</br>                <br>Bystanders were often important. Eleven patients reportedly  sought help from friends or family to make sure something was  definitely wrong, while 12 patients resisted the idea that they  were having a stroke and were forced by bystanders to get help.</br>                <br>In eight cases, bystanders actually delayed the process,  possibly because they didn't want to take responsibility for the  decisions, the study team writes.</br>                <br>The researchers also found delays in care when health care  workers didn't recognize the severity of symptoms. Two patients  were misdiagnosed at the hospital and sent home.</br>                <br> People experiencing stroke symptoms may not always be the  best judge of the seriousness of the symptoms, bystanders have a  big role to play in recognition of stroke and helping people to  get to appropriate care,  Mellor said.</br>                <br>Calling the emergency medical services number (911 in the  U.S.)  so that an ambulance can take them to hospital quickly  can make a real difference,  Mellor said.</br>                <br> People need to think 'FAST': Face drooping, Arm weakness,  and Speech difficulty, then Time to call 911,  Mellor said.</br>                <br>Dr. Justin Sattina, a neurologist at the University of  Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison who  was not involved in the UK research, said the importance of  bystanders stood out for him.</br>                <br> It's a story I've heard plenty of times, that the patient  resisted seeking help but the spouse insisted or they call the  daughter who happens to be a nurse or whatever, and that's why  they're here,  Sattin said.</br>                <br>He told Reuters Health he always reinforces that behavior.   The husband will be angry that the wife called 911 and it  caused a big scene with the ambulance out in front at their  house, and I say 'no, no, no, your wife did the right thing,'   Sattin said.  I see these little looks of thanks when I  reinforce that for the family. </br>                <br>Sattin said calling 911 is better than calling a relative or  a doctor because then the hospital gets alerted to be ready.</br>                <br/>                <br> The thing about coming in by 911 is that there's  pre-notification to the hospital that there's a stroke patient  coming in and everything clicks along faster,  Sattin said.</br>                <br>There's no time wasted in the waiting room, he said, and  some hospitals bypass the emergency room entirely and take  patients straight to the CT scanner.</br>                <br> You don't get the benefit of that if you (drive to the  hospital), even if it's true that you arrive at the front door a  little quicker, it disrupts what's really an intricate and  adjusted process of caring for acute stroke patients,  Sattin  said.</br>                <br>SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1umrHzI Annals of Emergency Medicine,  online November 15, 2014.</br> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 13:07:00 -0500"	"science"

"California Battles Worst Whooping Cough Epidemic In Seven Decades"	"SAN DIEGO (AP) — California officials are battling the worst whooping cough epidemic to hit the state in seven decades as a recent rebound in cases raises questions about the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine.<br /> <br /> Doctors emphasize that the inoculation has led to fewer deaths than in the past and in instances where people do get sick, their illnesses aren't as severe. But California officials say the limited protection of the vaccine introduced in the 1990s has led to the rise in cases. Research has shown it doesn't last as long as the one it replaced, and a new study suggests the vaccine may not prevent the spread of the disease. Whooping cough peaks every three to five years, and California's last epidemic was in 2010. But despite an aggressive public health campaign in response, the current outbreak is worse.<br /> <br /> A total of 9,935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health from Jan. 1 to Nov. 26 — the highest number in 70 years.  The cases included one infant who died. Elementary, middle and high school outbreaks have occurred across the state.<br /> <br /> The bacterial infection causes uncontrollable, violent coughing, which often makes it hard to breathe. People often take deep breaths which result in a  whooping  sound.<br /> <br /> San Diego County is among the hardest hit areas with 1,819 cases reported so far this year.<br /> <br />  We'd have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases,  said Dr. Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County.<br /> <br /> That's when whooping cough was common, causing hundreds of thousands of illnesses annually and thousands of deaths. But after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, cases dropped to fewer than 5,000 a year.<br /> <br /> That vaccine was replaced in the 1990s because of side effects, which included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. The newer vaccine is part of routine childhood vaccinations as well as adult booster shots.<br /> <br /> Last year was the nation's worst year for whooping cough in six decades— U.S. health officials received reports of more than 48,000 cases, including 18 deaths. This year the number of reported cases nationwide dropped to about 20,000.<br /> <br /> After the 2010 epidemic, California launched a campaign about the importance of rapid diagnosis and treatment, especially in young infants. The state also started providing free vaccines for children, pregnant and postpartum women.<br /> <br /> Dr. Gil Chavez, epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, said while more people, especially pregnant women, need to get vaccinated, he does not believe low inoculation rates are the primary cause of the current epidemic: Of this year's pediatric cases that had information on the child's vaccination history, only 10 percent of those infected in 2014 had not been vaccinated against pertussis.<br /> <br /> Chavez says the new vaccine's limitations and better tests have led to the increase in cases.<br /> <br /> Cases are likely to continue going up as doctors do a better job at detecting the illness, officials say.<br /> <br /> More than two years ago, Kathryn Riffenburg, who lives outside Boston, said doctors told her that her newborn son, Brady, likely had a cold. A week and a half later, she took him to the emergency room as he struggled to breathe.<br /> <br /> By the time, he was diagnosed with pertussis it was too late to save the 2-month-old boy.<br /> <br />  It made us angry, because we felt more should have been done,  said Riffenburg, who know advocates for pregnant women and anyone else in contact with infants to get vaccinated."

"Tiny Invisible Robot Gives Whole New Meaning To The Term 'Baby Steps'"	"One day in the not-too-distant future, doctors may be able to treat deadly diseases like cancer by injecting an army of tiny nanorobots into the bloodstream. We're not there yet, but researchers say they may be <a href= http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/science-blog/walkers-baby-steps-towards-molecular-robots  target= _hplink >one step closer to turning this science fiction-like idea into science fact</a>.<br /> <br /> Chemists at the University of Oxford have built a nano-sized molecule that can  walk  its way across a tiny track. The team developed a new method to observe the teensy robot take its one nanometer-long stride, since microscopes can only spot the motion of objects as small as 10 nanometers. <br /> <br />  These are the smallest steps that have been observed in real time, i.e. as they happen,  Dr. Hagan Bayley, a professor of chemical biology at the University of Oxford and one of the researchers, told The Huffington Post in an email.  The step size is about one 100,000th of the diameter of a human hair. <br /> <br /> The new  walkers  aren't the only tiny robots out there. Previous researchers have built <a href= http://news.discovery.com/tech/dna-nanobot-spider.htm  target= _hplink >molecular robots made of DNA</a>, but these were much bigger than the new small molecular walkers and only work in water, according to the Oxford Science Blog.<br /> <br /> For the new research, Bayley and his colleagues built their  walker  from an arsenic-containing molecule and placed it on a  track  made of a single strand of protein built inside a tiny protein pore. As the walker moved across the track's footholds, this caused changes in the current flowing through the pore. The researchers mapped these changes, allowing them to chart the walker's steps (see video below).<br /> <br />  At the moment we don’t have much control over which direction the walker moves in; it moves pretty randomly, Dr. Gokce Su Pulcu, a postdoctoral fellow who studies nanotechnology at the university and the lead author of the new research, told Oxford Science Blog. The protein track is a bit like a mountain slope; there's a direction that's easier to walk in so walkers will tend to go this way. We hope to be able to harness this preference to build tracks that direct a walker where we want it to go. <br /> <br /> The researchers hope that one day these nanobots may be able to deliver drugs throughout the body, or combine together into larger nanomachines that can operate inside cells.<br /> <br /> The new research was <a href= http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nnano.2014.264.html#affil-auth  target= _hplink >published online on Dec. 8</a> in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.<br /> <br /> <iframe width= 570  height= 428  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/WDF_Iij3yQ4?controls=0&showinfo=0  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 09:44:00 -0500"	"science"
"This Is How Much Of Beyoncé's Breath You Inhale Every Time You Breathe"	"Here is a classic problem given to students in statistics classes:  How many molecules of Caesar's last breath do you inhale every time you breathe? <br /> <br /> To answer the query, no scientific testing is required. Instead, students are asked to use mathematics in an effort to work their way to a guesstimation. This type of question is called a  Fermi problem,  where answers are found to seemingly impossible questions based on setting out clear approximations and assumptions. With this sort of analysis, you can get answers to questions even as crazy-seeming as,  How many molecules of Beyoncé's breath do you inhale every time you breathe? <br /> <br /> Before going any further, let's note that Beyoncé's breathing is particularly notable. In the 2004 Destiny's Child single  Lose My Breath,  Beyoncé -- along with Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams -- sings,  Can you keep up? / Baby boy, make me lose my breath / Bring the noise, make me lose my breath / Hit me hard, make me lose my...  Then they all breathe heavily. Aren't you at least a little bit curious how much of these Queen B exhales end up making it into your own plebeian lungs?<br /> <br /> To answer that Beyoncé-related Fermi Problem, The Huffington Post reached out to <a href= https://www.odu.edu/directory/people/l/lweinste  target= _hplink >Professor Lawrence Weinstein</a> of the Old Dominion University <a href= http://www.odu.edu/physics  target= _hplink >Department of Physics</a> and co-author of <em><a href= http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8625.html  target= _hplink >Guesstimation: Solving the World's Problems on the Back of a Cocktail Napkin</a></em>. Professor Weinstein was game to take on this pop culture Fermi problem quite thoroughly, this despite its ridiculous nature and Professor Weinstein certainly having more important things to do than humor us about Beyoncé.<br /> <br /> <em>All text below has been written by Professor Lawrence Weinstein and formatted/illustrated by The Huffington Post.</em><br /> <br /> <br /> <img alt= TK TK gifs  width= 570  src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/yoncebreatheeee.gif  /> <br /> <br /> <font size= 4 ><strong>How much of the air you just breathed was once breathed out by Beyoncé?</strong></font><br /> <br /> Let’s start with an easier question: How much air did Beyoncé just exhale? When you exhale you can certainly fill a 1-liter soda bottle, but not a lot more than that. However, that 1-liter of breath contains 3´10^22 air molecules (this comes from high school chemistry where one mole of gas contains 6´10^23 molecules and occupies 22 L of volume at standard temperature and pressure).<br /> <br /> <img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F1.png  data-mobile-src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F1_Mobile.png /><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F2.png  data-mobile-src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F2_Mobile.png /><br /> <br /> <br /> <br><font size= 4 ><strong>How big is the entire atmosphere?</strong></font><br /> <br /> To answer that we need to know (or Google) a few numbers. The volume of the atmosphere equals the surface area of the Earth (4´10^14m^2 or 400 million-million square meters) times the height of the atmosphere. Airplanes fly at 30,000 feet (or 10,000 meters) so there is some air up there.  However, there is not enough for us to breathe. Let’s use 10,000 m since it’s a nice round number. This gives a volume for the atmosphere of (4´10^14m^2)´(10^4m)=4´10^18m^3.  Since there are 1000 L in 1 m^3, this means that the atmosphere contains about 4´10^21 (or about 4 billion-trillion) breaths. This is why scientists use scientific notation (10 raised to some power) because otherwise keeping track of all the -illions gets confusing.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br><font size= 4 ><strong>How far does Beyoncé’s breath travel?</strong></font><br /> <br /> If you blow really hard, your breath might travel a few feet. Beyond that, we depend on wind and the motion of gas molecules (diffusion) to mix her breath throughout the atmosphere. At wind speeds of 10 mph, some of the molecules in one breath could travel around the Earth in a few months. We’ll assume that it takes a full year to spread a breath evenly around the globe so that the air around each us contains some of those molecules.<br /> <br /> <img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F3.png  data-mobile-src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F3_Mobile.png /><br /> <br /> <br /> <br><font size= 4 ><strong>How much of Beyoncé’s 3:47:29 PM January 2013 breath did you just inhale?</strong></font><br /> <br /> Beyoncé exhaled this more than a year ago, so it should be thoroughly mixed throughout the entire atmosphere. Since the atmosphere contains 4´10^21 breaths, you will only inhale 1/(4´10^21)»2´10^-22 of that breath. However, since that 3:47:29 PM January 2013 breath contained 3´10^22, you just inhaled <strong><em>six molecules</em></strong> of that special exhalation.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br><font size= 4 ><strong>So for every breath you take, you inhale six molecules from every breath Beyoncé exhaled. Doesn’t that make you feel special?</strong></font><br /> <br /> <img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F4.png  data-mobile-src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F4_Mobile.png /><br /> <br /> Pedantic physics note: all nitrogen molecules (or oxygen molecules or carbon-dioxide molecules …) are perfectly interchangeable. It is completely impossible, even theoretically, to trace a particular molecule back to a particular person’s particular breath. On the other hand, through the quirkiness of quantum mechanics, this means that ALL of the molecules you just inhaled have an equal (although terribly small) chance of having been exhaled by Beyoncé.<br /> <br /> <em>Graphics by Jan Diehm and gif illustration by Eva Hill for The Huffington Post.</em> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 09:29:50 -0500"	"science"
"What This Gay Atheist Learned From Being an Evangelical Christian"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-choir.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-13-choir.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-choir-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> I was raised as a devout Evangelical Christian. My readers know I discarded that identity as an adult and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-sosa/jesus-is-just-a-myth-tell_b_5749472.html  target= _hplink >don't mince words</a> whenever the subject of religion arises. But what many probably don't realize is that religion continues to impact my life in profound ways. Sociologists say that even American atheists are often  cultural Christians,  as the roots of our identities come from the experiences of both our pasts and current surroundings. And most U.S. citizens were raised in and around Christianity.<br /> <br /> Evangelical Christianity, which, like all religious systems, has a host of well-documented problems. But I won't be discussing those here, as it's something I do often. This is about the way communities shape our identities, and how good can be drawn even from the experiences of identities we later reject.<br /> <br /> These five concepts exist in many other forms around the world, but I discovered them through being a Christian. After a few years outside the isolation of an Evangelical community, these are values I find most lacking in the mainstream and would pass on to others who are still building their own identities.<br /> <br /> <strong>Intimacy is not just for romantic partners.</strong> Those who have spent a lot of time around Evangelicals will notice that they tend to have uniquely personal relationships with each other. Platonic male friendships are the most noticeable, as they veer outside the emotional boundaries of masculinity in mainstream culture. They're often physically affectionate, talk openly about subjects that make most people feel vulnerable and routinely say  I love you. <br /> <br /> <strong>Caring for the needs of others leads to a happier life.</strong> When someone was without food, clothing, shelter or other necessities, the church would step in to help. And by  the church,  I mean the people within it would often individually offer their assistance. Caring for others wasn't just a duty, it was viewed as a privilege. Through that service, people formed bonds that remained throughout their lifetimes and, as a bonus, ensured that goodwill existed for themselves if they fell onto hard times.<br /> <br /> <strong>Using polite language averts hostility.</strong> This easy lifestyle choice is a valuable one for both professional and private interaction. Cursing and overt disrespect almost never lead to a better result, because displays of anger show a lack of self-control and stability while putting the other person on the defense. People have trust for individuals whose behavior isn't abusive, even when having a disagreement.<br /> <br /> <strong>Music is an essential component of community.</strong> Evangelicals sing <em>all the time</em>. And despite what  Footloose  would have you believe, Christian usually love to dance. Music forms a huge part of religious identity. The worship songs of Christianity are often based on communal joy and celebration. Uplifting music is a reliable tool for easing social tension and bringing diverse groups of people together in a dynamic way.<br /> <br /> <strong>Loving others is our primary responsibility.</strong> Evangelical Christians believe that love is greater than even faith, which is written by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians. While one can turn on the news and see Christian leaders ignoring this value, it doesn't change the fact that the concept imprinted itself on my life. As a lifestyle vegan, civil rights advocate and progressive political commentator, love remains the guiding force in the derivation of my values.<br /> <br /> Will I be returning to Evangelical Christianity? Nope. But that doesn't mean I can't use the best parts of my past to inform the choices I make as I step into the future. "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 16:31:08 -0500"	"religion"
"In the Face of Systemic Racism, South Asians Must Not Keep Silent"	"These past few weeks have been gut-wrenching for African Americans and other communities of conscience. The execution of black men and forgotten black women by white police officers, and the failure of justice first reemerging in Ferguson and now in New York City, have poured salt into the festering wound of systemic racism that has marred America's history.<br /> <br /> They have also been painful for me to watch as an Indian-American immigrant who was brought to this country as a child. This is now my adopted country. Although I was not born here, I found my voice here, found the music of my childhood here, and fell in love here. America is now home in ways that India can never be.<br /> <br /> And yet, I cannot be at home in this nation. How can I, in a land where my white brethren routinely kill my black brothers and sisters? Watching this bloodletting compels me to ask what are the obligations of those who are neither black nor white in this fratricidal country? Should we stay out of the fray, mindful of the marginality that comes to many of us because of our status as immigrants?<br /> <br /> As a Christian, I am guided by the prophet Jeremiah's words to Judah's exiles in Babylon:  Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon ... Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. <br /> <br /> If God calls an exilic people to work for the well being of their captors, then I too am bound to work for the welfare of this land. But how can this country be well so long as this centuries old racial divide violates the American body politic? Those of us of other hues must make labor with African Americans in order to free America from its captivity to white supremacy.<br /> <br /> This country has been largely kind to South Asians in ways that it has never been to its black citizens. African Americans have been enslaved, tortured, lynched and now criminalized, victimized by the New Jim Crow prison-industrial complex, and shot dead by police at 21 times the rate that whites are.<br /> <br /> After 9/11, Muslim communities came under suspicion and have been subjected to aggressive policing. After 9/11, Sikhs have been violated by hate crimes and even by mass murder as in the case of the Oak Creek Gurdwara shooting. The reach of white supremacy is long, and South Asians too have felt its sting.<br /> <br /> But there can be no question of symmetry; any suggestion of equivalence between the sufferings of South Asians and African Americans would be invidious. After all, agents of the state routinely execute African Americans whereas Sikh Americans have been killed by isolated white supremacists.<br /> <br /> Over recent years, I have watched as some have held up the success of the Indian American community to say that the United States is a land of opportunity in which anyone, regardless of race, can make it. The point of this discourse is explicit: see, South Asians have made it here so blacks have only themselves to blame for their own predicament.<br /> <br /> When South Asians like Dinesh D'Sousa speak in this fashion, they accept the status of  honorary white  and its attendant privileges; this status is offered on the condition that we keep silent about race and accept our compliant role as a  model minority.  Some of the most successful members of the Indian community have accepted this devil's bargain -Governors Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley, for example - and have been handsomely rewarded. The best that Governor Jindal can spout after Ferguson is the stale and deadly rhetoric of color-blindness and victim blaming:<br /> <br />  A young man is dead - this situation is truly a tragedy and our hearts go out to his family ... Some have used this as an excuse for lawlessness, arson and destroying property, but that is not the answer ... I do not care what pigmentation anyone's skin is. Justice is color blind, God is color blind, and I believe we all should be color blind. <br /> <br /> To talk about God's color-blindness and his in a country that kills according to color is an exercise in complicity.<br /> <br /> South Asians of conscience have a special obligation to speak out when we see uniformed officers snuff out black lives without consequence. Our histories are interlinked because African-Americans and Indians have fought together to forge a global nonviolent struggle to liberate those that W.E.B. Du Bois called the  darker races of the earth. <br /> <br /> The pain of the African-American community should bring South Asians of conscience to grief, frustration and rage, not least because we know we are in this country because our black brothers and sisters marched, fought and died to make this country a more just and inclusive nation. The Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, and the Immigration and Nationality Act passed in 1965. The latter Act struck down race-based immigration quotas that prevented Asians from entering the United States. Without the work of Rosa Parks, Bayard Rustin, James Lawson, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Martin Luther King, Jr., without Montgomery and Selma, our communities of color would not be here. The struggles that made 1964 possible also made 1965 possible.<br /> <br /> The Civil Rights Movement was itself the fruit of the shared spiritual yearnings of African-Americans and Indians. Therefore, South Asian immigrants are under historical, moral and spiritual obligations to refuse offers of white privilege and join in solidarity with African-Americans. We must remember the long conversation between W.E.B. Du Bois, Benjamin Mays, Howard and Sue Bailey Thurman, Mordecai Johnson and B.R. Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi that sought to bind together our peoples in a common struggle for justice in India and the United States.<br /> <br /> Next semester, Cornel West and I will co-teach a course on Gandhi and King at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. The course will explore the transmission of ideas and energies and the long enduring bond between the United States and India, between African Americans and Indians. That connection includes what Gandhi learned from American abolitionists and Quakers through Tolstoy, who learned about the promise of nonviolence in part by a close study of the American scene.<br /> <br /> When an African American delegation led by Howard Thurman and his wife Sue Baily Thurman visited Gandhi, Gandhi famously and prophetically said to Dr. Thurman,  It may be through the Negroes that the unadulterated message of nonviolence will be delivered to the world.  We seek by our work to advance Gandhi's hope.<br /> <br /> We are also committed to this course because we want to learn again with our courageous, justice-seeking students about the transformative power of radical and disruptive nonviolent resistance, a power that young black leaders are demonstrating again in the streets of Ferguson. We believe strongly that South Asian Americans and African-Americans must bind ourselves together to bring the promise of nonviolent resistance to bear on the work of healing the American soul of the cancer of racism.<br /> <br /> <em><a href= http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2014/12/10/4146064.htm  target= _hplink >This piece was originally published here</a>. </em> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 15:11:50 -0500"	"religion"

Although the autonomous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq was already a refuge for an estimated 250,000 Syrian refugees, since the Islamic State began its onslaught on Iraq in June, Kurdistan has also taken in a more than one and a half million displaced people. Many have been placed in purpose-built refugee camps but the huge numbers mean thousands of others are forced to live in un-finished buildings or inadequate, makeshift shelters and as winter in the region closes in, there are growing concerns for the welfare of the refugees who, while their homes are still in ISIL controlled territory, have no realistic prospect of returning to them. <br /> <br /> <strong>Mexico City, Mexico: December 12<br /> </strong><img alt= religion  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388486/thumbs/o-RELIGION-900.jpg?1  /><br /> Pilgrims prepare to perform a traditional dance outside the Basilica of Guadalupe on Our Lady of Guadalupe's feast day in Mexico City, Mexico. <br /> <br /> <strong>Karbala, Iraq: December 13<br /> </strong><img alt= religion  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388474/thumbs/o-RELIGION-900.jpg?1  /><br /> Iraqi Shiite Muslim pilgrims attend the Arbaeen religious festival which marks the 40th day after Ashura, commemorating the seventh century killing of Prophet Mohammed's grandson, Imam Hussein, at the Imam Hussein shrine in Karbala, 50 miles (80 kilometres) south of Baghdad.

"Celebrating Christmas"	"It was about 2,044 years ago, in 30 B.C., that there was a great celebration throughout all of the Roman Empire, especially among Roman leaders.  The Roman army became the supreme ruler of the land, and the ships of the Roman people became the rulers of the sea.  There was no question that Rome was the ruler of the world as it was known at that time.<br /> <br /> There appeared to be much glory and splendor throughout all of Rome, but much of it was like surface skin that covers deep and fatal sores not visible on the surface -- in this case, the hidden resentment of the common people. They were poor. And more than being poor, the common people were terribly mistreated. Cruelty seemed to be the policy of the government toward them.  As far as the common people were concerned, there was no hope for the future, and they had become depressed, despondent, easy to mistreat and subjected to becoming slaves.<br /> <br /> But one night all of this changed when, in Bethlehem, a young girl, unknown to the world, gave birth to a baby boy. This event was to change all history. For this baby boy grew to be a great man -- a man called by the name of Jesus. His birthday marks more than the date of his birth, it marks the birth of a new era -- the inauguration of a new culture -- the beginning of a new creed -- the fountainhead of man's hope. <br /> <br /> Although the birth took place in what was then a relatively unimportant walled town (about 1,000 people) built on a limestone ridge of the Judaean highland that overlooks the Dead Sea, such a significant event could not go unnoticed. The world noticed it then, and for the majority of time since then the world has noticed it.  And certainly we notice it now.  In fact, the celebration of the birthday of Jesus is the most widely celebrated holiday throughout the world today.  But it hasn't always been that way.<br />  <br /> In the early days of the Christian Church it was illegal to be a Christian.  Many early Christians did not celebrate Christmas for fear of being severely persecuted, and those who did celebrate Christmas did so secretly so as not to call attention to themselves.  There are nativity scenes carved in rocks of the ancient catacombs of Rome where the Christians frequently hid during the days of persecution.<br /> <br /> After Constantine became the undisputed emperor of the Roman Empire, sometime between A.D. 320 and 325 he declared that Christians would no longer be persecuted.  In fact, instead of it being illegal to be a Christian, he declared that all people should be Christians.  So Christians began celebrating Christmas once again.  It had been almost 300 years since they celebrated the birth of Christ.  They reverted to their Hebrew heritage and centered the Christmas celebration on a feast, a typical way for Hebrew people to celebrate great occasions.<br /> <br /> This is not to suggest that such feasts were times when people gathered around large tables to eat festive foods.  Feasts, or more correctly festivals, were times of dancing, singing, eating, and entertainment, sometimes lasting several days.  The early Christians named the Christmas celebration  The Feast of the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> It was sometime around A.D. 1038 that the word  Christmas  began to evolve.  The established church at that time realized that the most significant aspect of the celebration of the birth of Jesus was the  Mass --the celebration of the Sacrament of Holy Eucharist in conjunction with a worship service focused on the birth of the Savior.  So the church changed the name of the celebration of the birth of Jesus from  The Feast of the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ  to  Christ Mass,  more popularly called  Christ's Mass  or the  Mass of Christ.    It is understandable how Christ Mass evolved into  Christmas.   Since about A.D. 1050,  Christmas  has been the word used throughout the world to refer to the time Jesus was born.<br /> <br /> The Bible does not tell us the exact birth date of Jesus.  We only know that it was during  the first enrollment when Quirinius was governor of Syria.  (Luke 2:3, RSV)  There has been much scholarly research as to exactly when this would have been.  The general consensus is that Jesus was born sometime between 7 and 4 B.C., probably closer to 4 B.C.  But there is no indication of what days or month such a census would have conducted.<br /> <br /> The probable day and month of the birth of Jesus finally narrowed down to January 6 or December 25.  The problem primarily was that there were several very popular pagan feasts celebrated about those same times of year.  Some Christian leaders wanted to have the celebration of Christ's birthday on the same day as one of the popular pagan feasts in order to keep Christians from joining the pagan festivities, while others wanted to make sure that there was no connection between the pagan feasts and the celebration of Christmas.<br /> <br /> Finally, about 350 years after the birth of Jesus, Bishop Liberius of Rome declared the date of Christmas as December 25, and since then that is the date that has been accepted by nearly all the peoples of the world.  <br /> <br /> Actually, we will never know the exact birth date of Jesus.  But that really doesn't make any difference, for we know that Jesus was a real person who is still alive and is a very real presence in our lives today.  Let us focus on that as we prepare for a blessed Christmas celebration.<br /> <br /> Next week we will take a look at Mary and Joseph. "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 09:20:44 -0500"	"religion"
"Massive Nativity Scene Reportedly Breaks World Record"	"A full 1,039 people, as well as a camel and several sheep, took part in a <a href= http://www.good4utah.com/story/d/story/utah-youtubers-help-break-record-for-worlds-larges/35155/4M8C-4lzA0ulOVkOZtxz-Q  target= _hplink >massive nativity scene</a> filmed in Provo, Utah on Dec. 1 that reportedly broke the <a href= http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-living-figures-in-a-nativity-scene/  target= _hplink >Guinness World Record</a>.<br /> <br /> The idea for the project came from Christian media group <a href= http://www.radiant.org/press  target= _hplink >The Radiant Foundation</a>, a sub-brand of the Deseret Management Corporation, which hoped to offer a holiday message that would  show the importance of Christ during Christmas,  according to Radiant's digital strategist John Dye.<br /> <br /> Radiant approached several Christian YouTube stars, including The Piano Guys, American Idol winter David Archuleta and Peter Hollens who agreed to take part in the scene and who were joined by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in a sweeping <a href= http://youtu.be/PrLoWt2tfqg  target= _hplink >rendition</a> of  Angels We Have Heard on High  for the scene. In addition to breaking the Guinness record for most people in a nativity scene, Dye said he also believed the event to have been one of the largest collaborations of YouTubers ever. <br /> <br />  Our goal is to give people the inspiration to share this with others and help them understand the importance of Christ,  Dye told HuffPost over the phone.<br /> <br /> The video was produced on  a shoestring budget,  Dye said, and was dependent on the help of volunteers, many of them students at the nearby Brigham Young University. Dye worried the weather on the December filming date might deter volunteers, but said it ended up being unseasonably warm. This, as well as other near-mishaps, convinced him that  divine intervention  was at play in the production.<br /> <br />  We really feel that this was something that needed to be done,  Dye told HuffPost.  We felt inspired to do it and we saw inspiration all along the way in the hand of the Almighty in this process.  "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 09:05:08 -0500"	"religion"
"Bill Nye: Creationism Is 'Raising A Generation Of Young People Who Can't Think'"	"The biggest danger creationism plays, according to Bill Nye the  Science Guy,  is that it is raising a generation of children who  can't think   and who  will not be able to participate in the future in same way  as those who are taught evolution.<br /> <br /> Speaking on <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq3CvTP_LHc  target= _hplink >MidPoint</a>, Nye said he blames an older generation of evangelicals  who have very strong conservative views  and who are  reluctant to let kids learn about evolution.  Their <a href= http://www.businessinsider.com/texas-school-board-debate-on-evolution-2013-11  target= _hplink >presence on school boards</a> leads to debates over curriculum, Nye argued, which further inhibits schools' ability to teach facts.<br /> <br />  Religion is one thing. People get tremendous comfort and community with their religions,  Nye said.  But whatever you believe, whatever deity or higher power you might believe in, the Earth is not 6,000 years old.  <br /> <br /> Nye, who has a new book out titled  Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation,  recently participated in a <a href= http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/02/04/271648691/watch-the-creationism-vs-evolution-debate-bill-nye-and-ken-ham  target= _hplink >debate</a> with creationist Ken Ham, which some argued was a moment of embarrassment for the science community.<br /> <br /> University of Chicago evolution professor Jerry A.

"Saudi Artist Photographs Daily Life From Behind A Veil And Learns Unexpected Lesson"	"While the mandate that women should cover their hair is an tenet of Islamic belief, the act of wearing a veil that completely shields a woman's face is a matter of tradition, not religion. For Saudi photographer <a href= http://www.faisalalmalki.com/  target= _hplink >Faisal Almalki</a>, this female ritual remained one shrouded in mystery. He resolved to experience the practice for himself, documenting the entire experience with his camera.<br /> <br /> <img alt= untitiled  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381070/thumbs/o-UNTITILED-900.jpg  /><br /> <br />  It started as both a visual and investigative experiment,  Almalki told the Huffington Post Arts.  From a visual point of view, I -- as a photographer and person -- cherish sight and I've always wondered how veils affect sight and seeing. But on a more contextual level, I've always wanted to understand this sub-culture and I thought if I managed to at least see the world they way they see it, I might scratch the surface of 'walking a mile in their shoe.' <br /> <br /> For his photographic investigation, Almalki took inspiration from 20th century German biologist Jakob von Uexkull, particularly his idea of the '<em>umwelt</em>' or 'self-world as perceived by organisms living within it.' The artist stepped into the role of biologist to fully immerse himself in this alien way of life.  Understanding how organisms experience their surroundings, needs and motivations can only be achieved by stepping into their perceptual world,  the exhibition expressed.  An organism creates and reshapes its own <em>umwelt</em> when it interacts with its environment.  <br /> <br /> <img alt= breath  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381072/thumbs/o-BREATH-900.jpg  /><br />  <br /> Almaki titled his series  Lone Canyon,  referencing the gap between a woman and her veil. Yet as the photographic process continued, the artist noticed it changing shape.  I took a few photos of flowers as seen from behind the veil, except some of those flowers weren’t real –- but the veil affects vision enough for us (ie. Her) not to see the difference. And that’s when I realized that I wasn’t trying to understand veiled women, I was trying to judge them.  While the project began as an effort to see through an Islamic woman's eyes (and veil), it ended up revealing the biased mode of viewing the artist himself possessed.<br /> <br />  Those pictures instead became a portrait of my prejudice,  he explained.  I’ve always resented how some western media outlets profiled Muslims and Middle Eastern, and this showed me how I was doing the same. Turning the veil onto that barrier between us and 'the others,' whoever that might be. <br /> <br /> <img alt= post  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381076/thumbs/o-POST-900.jpg  /><br /> <br /> As Almaki's series progressed, the symbols associated with the veil changed shape.  When I started working on this project, I kept saying that I wasn't pro or against veils, I just wanted to offer their perspective to the world.  Yet Almaki realized that for many, the veil isn't just a symbol of difference but of inferiority, of otherness.  Suddenly, the veil, became a symbol of prejudice, that wall between any person and 'the others.'  Almaki's project then transformed into an investigation of the invisible veil that so many unknowingly wear, the obstructive layer of prejudice.<br /> <br />  Lone Canyon  runs at Athr Gallery in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia until January 10, 2015.

"Torture and the Killing of Jesus"	"In the 1950s and early 1960s, trend-setting comedian Lenny Bruce often said,  If Jesus had been killed twenty years ago, Catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses. <br /> <br /> Bruce was right that any device used to kill Jesus Christ in any age would have become a symbol of both divine judgment and divine deliverance to the faithful. What Bruce did not get right was his assumption that the cross of the first century was equal to the electric chair of the twentieth century, that both were meant only to execute. The truth is that the cross was a Roman tool of torture before it was a tool of death. It was meant to inflict such horrible suffering on a single man that an entire nation was made to cower.<br /> <br /> This is a truth that ought to condition attitudes toward torture today, particularly among those who regard Jesus as God. It means that there is a direct connection between the events of that first Good Friday and the torture depicted in the recent film Zero Dark Thirty, that there is a line to be drawn between Guantanamo Bay and Golgotha, between the evils of Bashar al-Assad, president of Syria, and the evils of Pontius Pilate, governor of Judea. <br /> <br /> In the Roman mind, crucifixion was an act of state terror. By the time of Jesus, the ancient world had already tried dealing with its undesirables by boiling them in oil, stoning them, strangling them, drowning them and setting them on fire. All of these brought on death too quickly. Officials wanted a method of killing that was slow and terrifying enough that no onlooker missed the implied threat. Crucifixion met this need.<br /> <br /> The name reveals the purpose: cruciare-torture. In practice, it was simply death by impalement. In meaning, it was a statement of what rulers could do to anyone who resisted their will. <br /> <br /> The Romans learned the art of crucifixion from the Greeks, improved upon it, and made it a tool of Empire. In answer to the slave revolt under Spartacus in 71 B.C., the Empire crucified six thousand rebels, famously lining the road from Rome to Capua with crosses. During the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., the Romans crucified as many as 500 rebels a day. <br /> <br /> Crucifixion was the perfect blend of death, vengeance, spectacle and terror. Victims took days to expire, sometimes as much as a week. Soldiers taunted and further tortured the dying, often driving stakes through body parts associated with the victim's crimes. Genitalia received special attention. Wildlife sometimes ate away at bodies before the mercy of death arrived. <br /> <br /> Nearly alone against such horrors in the ancient world was the teaching of the Jews. Their law taught that men were made in the image of God and thus the human body was holy. This truth was the basis for prohibitions against murder, against cutting oneself in grief, even against tattoos. So great a matter was punishment by death that even after lawful executions, the dead were removed by sundown so that the land itself would not be desecrated. <br /> <br /> The Romans had no such scruples and it is why sometime around 30 A.D. Jesus of Nazareth spent six hours gasping wide-eyed for breath while soldiers gambled for his clothes and crowds of onlookers urged him to get on with the business of dying. He was killed in a place so public that many who watched him die came upon him accidentally. This was all as Rome intended: a cruel death meant not merely to kill a man but to kill the spirit of a nation, to end not just a single Jew but the threat that any Jew might pose to the Empire.<br /> <br /> We should see the ancient Roman zeal for crucifixion as one with its later zeal for the cruelties of the gladiators' games and, ultimately, as one with the hardening and barbarity of an entire people. Torture as martial technique led to torture as entertainment and eventually to torture as commonplace and nearly unremarkable. Nobility died in this progression, as did compassion, and, finally, the Empire itself.<br /> <br /> It could very well be the same in our own time. While there is certainly a place for aggressive interrogation -- even deception and the intimidation of captives -- in the conduct of a just war, dehumanizing torture produces a dehumanized people, bitterness that endures for generations, and an undermining of the noble principles that may have at first given legitimacy to the conduct of war. <br /> <br /> Those who worship Jesus -- the most famously tortured man in history -- ought to be the greatest opponents of the kind of tortures he endured. If their faith grows from the soil of the Jewish law and if they remember what their ancestors endured at the hand of Rome and a hundred other persecutors, they will stand against the similar violation of the image of God in man today.<br /> <br /> Torture is not merely an issue of political left or right. It is not just an issue of military opinion versus civilian. It is an issue that grows from the nature of man, from the principled vision of a nation and from the highest of religious truth. There is no better time to assert this than during the Christmas season, a time in which we celebrate the life of Jesus. There is also no better time to assert this than the present moment in our nation's history, a time in which we hope to learn from the excesses of our recent wars and to live out, in Lincoln's hopeful phrase,  the better angels of our nature.

"Rebirth of a Nation"	"In the third chapter of the ancient Gospel narrative titled John, a religious leader named Nicodemus approached Jesus under the cover of night. Jesus stated,  I tell you the truth, unless you are born again, you cannot see the Kingdom of God.  Nicodemus then inquired of The Christ,  What do you mean? How can an old man go back into his mother's womb and be born again?  <br /> <br />    As with Nicodemus, the idea of rebirth has been a point of contention, controversy and curiosity, a point vigorously debated among the early church councils, a point of departure among diverse adherents to the faith. Just what does it mean to be  born again ? Of many perceptions of meaning, one prominent belief is that to be  born again  is to be released from the fatal consequences of sin, which first originated with Adam and Eve and became a heritage for the entire human family, and to have the hope of an Utopian existence with God in a future time. <br /> <br />    If America has a sin of origins, a sin deeply rooted within the nation's epistemology, it is undoubtedly racism. Permeating the soil and soul of our country even before the nation's founding, and fully grafted into our nation's DNA through its founding documents, racism is a sin long befalling America. <br /> <br />    If the wages of sin is indeed death, America's bloodied history reveals that we have been fully compensated.  <br /> <br />    In 1915, American racism may have reached its zenith with the cinematic release of <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>. Widely regarded as a cinematic masterpiece and historically footnoted as the first motion picture screened at The White House, <em>The Birth of a Nation's</em> racist depictions of African Americans -- especially African American men as inherently ignorant, violent and hyper-sexualized savages -- aided the Ku Klux Klan, who used the film as a recruitment tool, in dramatically increasing its membership rolls. The movie reflected and exasperated fears of an American society under Black rule, fears emergent during the Reconstruction Era after Blacks were freed from slavery, en masse. <br /> <br />    Our nation's xenophobic proclivities have caused great harm to many and have led to generations of marginalization and oppression. <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> vividly offered a portrait of White America's worse nightmare: a society run a muck by freed Blacks. The film would reached its horrifying height as a white woman fled through the woods to escape a large Black male seeking to rape her. <br /> <br />    Ironically, although common, the Black male rapist was depicted by a white male actor. When finally cornered by her would-be assailant, the white woman leapt from a cliff to her death. As she fell, she incited the murderous intentions of thousands, and hundreds of real Black men became their victims.  Since its release nearly one hundred years ago, we have lived in an era defined by the film's cultural constructions, the greatest legacy of which is the terrifying Black man -- ignorant, deviant, bent on destruction. This construction is so ingrained within our nation's consciousness that, for many, the Black man is the personification of evil.<br /> <br />    Even as The White House is presently occupied by a biracial, African American self-identifying man and his Black family, constructions of African Americans as ignorant, violent and sexual deviants remain prevalent throughout culture and media. These constructions are not without consequence, and it has often proven fatal. In fact, it is this cruel criminalization of color that has resulted in the death of countless unarmed Blacks at the hands of police officers for generations. <br /> <br />    As innocent blood flows in our nation's streets, parks, stoops and stairwells, it calls forth for justice. As constricted airways whisper forth screams of agony, it calls forth for a new day. As the body count attributed to these painful atrocities continues to rise, our nation has reached a boiling point and the calls for justice amid gross injustices has resulted in an uprising. It is in the midst of these uprisings, the likes of which we have not seen upon these shores in two generations, that America is being reborn.<br /> <br />    Surely some are as Nicodemus, unsure, even doubtful of the possibilities of this rebirth. Jesus answered Nicodemus' concern thusly:  The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can't tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can't explain how people are [born again].  <br /> <br />    It may be hard to explain rebirth, but it is easy to hear. <br /> <br />    I recently had the opportunity to address a  This Stops Today Rally  in downtown Dallas. As I panned the diverse crowd, the cries of  Black lives matter,   Hands up, don't shoot,   No justice, no peace,   I can't breathe,  and  This stops today  filled the night time air. Under the cover of night, the mystery of rebirth once again unfolded.<br /> <br />    I told the story of Allen Brooks, a 50-year-old Black man who had been accused of assaulting a white child. I acknowledged that any Black man accused of anything in 1910 was deemed guilty by mere accusation. As he appeared in court, a mob broke into the courtroom, placed a noose around his neck and threw him out the second floor window. He landed head first upon the ground below. <br /> <br />    Some have stated the fall may have killed him, but he was still stripped of his clothes, then dragged by the rope around his neck to the corner of Elm and Akard Streets where he was lynched. His body would later have to be rushed out of the city as, after being cut down, the rabid crowd still desired to burn Brooks' body. When the judge called a grand jury to identify Brooks' killers, although a multiplicity of police officers were present, and although there were horrific pictures of the day's tragedy, the police officers said that they could not identity one offender. <br /> <br />    For Allen Brooks, there was no justice.<br /> <br />    As we gathered that night, only 0.3 miles from where Brooks was lynched, it was impressed upon me that the same sin that killed Allen Brooks in 1910, and the same sin that informed <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> in 1915, continues to claim new victims today. So as we rallied and marched, it was not just for Michael Brown, Eric Garner, John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Ezell Ford, but for all whose names history no longer remembers but who suffered similar fates.<br /> <br />    As we continue to lie down, march, chant and organize for justice together, we serve as the midwives to our nation's rebirth. Our collective cries echoing forth in these winds of change signify that our nation's water has finally broken in order that justice might  flow like rivers, and righteousness like a mighty stream.  America is contracting, and ours will not be a still birth. No, these present labor pains will bring forth justice and equality to all! <br /> <br />    On account of America's many sins, we are now being redeemed <em>by</em> the people and <em>for</em> the people. Our fight is still young, and it is not without opposition. Indeed, there appear to be days of struggle ahead. Although the road ahead remains challenged, the imperative before us is clear: <br /> <br />    Push! <br /> <br />    Our labor shall not be in vain. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 17:18:22 -0500"	"religion"
"Social Worker Empowers Muslim Women In Need With Sewing Class"	"When Tahani Jabarin started the Introduction to Sewing and Dressmaking program at the <a href= http://www.daralhijrah.net/ns/  target= _hplink >Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center</a> in northern Virginia, she was hoping to create  a road to self-sufficiency  for Muslim women in her area. Made possible by a $10,000 grant from <a href= http://www.irusa.org/  target= _hplink >Islamic Relief</a>, a U.S.-based charity organization, the sewing class graduated its first class of 12 students on Nov. 5.<br /> <br /> Jabarin, 37, told The Huffington Post she could not be happier with the results.  Thank God things went great,  she said.<br /> <br /> A social worker at Dar Al-Hijrah with no background in sewing, Jabarin said she chose the subject because it's something women with children can do from home. Jabarin runs the program, but she hired a woman with commercial sewing experience to teach the actual classes. Women ages 18 and above who earn half the area median income or less, or who receive financial assistance like food stamps, were eligible to sign up for the first round of lessons, as long as they agreed to attend every one, Jabarin said.<br /> <br /> Participants were also asked to pay a $300 fee for the class, but were issued waivers if they were unable to afford the cost. In exchange, the women received six hours of instruction every week for 16 weeks, with an additional four-hour workshop on starting their own business. Projects included clothing and home decor like curtains and lampshades. Dar Al-Hijrah sells the students' work on-site, Jabarin said, and each student gets 50 percent of whatever proceeds her pieces bring in, meaning the women can receive an income even during the program.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sewing class  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371058/thumbs/o-SEWING-CLASS-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps most significantly, those who completed 100 hours of sewing received their own machine, which Jabarin described as crucial for ensuring the women would continue their work after graduating. Of the 12 women who graduated in November, Jabarin said that more than half started making an income within two weeks of completing the course. A new 16-week course, she said, began earlier this month.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sewing class  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371048/thumbs/o-SEWING-CLASS-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> <br /> Jabarin spoke with one of the graduates on behalf of HuffPost Religion to illustrate the program's effect on participants. Due to a language barrier, Jabarin spoke to the woman in Arabic and translated her answers into English.<br /> <br /> <strong>How did you find the sewing group?</strong><br /> <br /> My name is Fawzia, and I was born in Sudan. I am 42 years old, and I have eight children, ages 25, 23, 17, 9, 8, 5, 2 years old and 4 months old. As an immigrant mother with eight children, I was facing financial instability that lost me my apartment and led me to seek a home in a shelter. Fortunately, the shelter I was placed in happened to be within walking distance of Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center. Through [a social worker's] help, I joined the sewing class, which enabled me to become self-sufficient via training whilst establishing an income. I applied for a waiver, since I had no income through which to pay for this class, and I received it, rendering my sewing lessons charge-free.<br /> <br /> <strong>What have been some of the biggest struggles in your life since coming to the U.S.?</strong><br /> <br /> My most immediate issue was the language barrier. I required some time to learn the English language and become accustomed to speaking it. Secondly, as a mother, I faced the enormous problem of finding an apartment to rent for me to live in with my children. Having been blessed with a large family, it was difficult finding a place big enough to accommodate us. Not being able to be a self-sufficient mother who could provide for her children shook me to the core.<br /> <br /> <strong>In what ways, if any, does the holiday season affect these concerns?</strong><br /> <br /> The holiday season is more taxing, as this is a family-oriented time during which I wish to present my children with the most joyous experience possible whilst also working hard to provide for them. I received support from my children’s elementary school, which donated gift cards to me in order to be able to purchase the Thanksgiving turkey. Simultaneously, I receive continuous support from Dar Al-Hijrah, which has a thrift store on-site. At any point that I need assistance buying clothing, I apply for aid and receive a $100 gift card to use at the store in order to keep my children and myself warm during this colder time of year. <br /> <br /> <strong>In what ways has joining the sewing class made a difference in your life?</strong><br /> <br /> During this difficult year of my life, these obstacles enclosed me in a severe depression that I even received therapy for. Nothing seemed to really help me deal with the crippling mentality that I was unproductive until I joined the sewing group. Walking down from the shelter to the Islamic Center every Monday and Wednesday became something to look forward to, and my mood was automatically elevated on those days.<br /> <br /> Additionally, the shelter kept telling me that I had an “exit date” and that I had to find a place to live. It just so happened that my graduation date coincided with my exit date from the shelter. It was my graduation, and the program director’s recommendation, that allowed the shelter to extend my stay for one more week. My life had finally begun looking up. I was becoming self-sufficient, which had always been my dream, and I was finally able to provide for my children.<br /> <br /> I learned that much like sewing, life occurs in several stages, not all at once. Having acquired patience, I was able to push myself through these difficult times and persevere until I was able to improve my life. Having received my certificate of completion and my sewing machine, I finally felt like a productive member of society.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are your hopes for improving your family’s circumstances moving forward, and how will the skills you’ve learned through the sewing group help you?</strong><br /> <br /> The day I graduated, I received my sewing machine from Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center. Furthermore, Dar Al-HIjrah connected me with the county’s case workers, who held several workshops that taught us to transform our sewing skills into a commercial method in order for us to establish our own businesses and become self-employed.<br /> <br /> I walked into this class thinking I would only be taught to sew clothing, but soon thereafter I learned that was not the case. Aside from sewing clothing, I learned how to create home décor items like handkerchiefs and even custom-made draperies.

" Troubled  Moses or Traumatic Origins of the Bible?"	"The star of the new Ridley Scott movie about Moses,  Exodus: Gods and Kings  (release Dec. 12), described Moses earlier this Fall (as reported in <a href= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christian-bale-playing-moses-he-737012  target= _hplink >the Hollywood Reporter</a>) as  a very troubled and tumultuous man  who was  likely a schizophrenic and was one of the most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life.  Though these comments by Christian Bale show insensitivity to contemporary communities for whom the figure of Moses is deeply important, he has picked up on an important feature of the stories surrounding Moses: they are saturated in ancient experiences of trauma. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have no way to ascertain whether Moses personally suffered from trauma. He lived long before history was written down in Israel and the stories about him are shrouded in centuries of later tradition. That said, we do know that the biblical books about Moses (Exodus --Deuteronomy) were completed in the wake of ancient Israel's deepest crisis, hundreds of years after Moses: when the holy and supposedly invulnerable city of Jerusalem had been destroyed, its kingship ended, and its populace sent into seeming permanent exile in Babylon. <br /> <br /> This crisis, this experience of exile, was so intense that it qualifies as an ancient example of  trauma.  Indeed the exile was so traumatic for the ancient Israelites that they rarely wrote about it directly. The histories of the Bible go up to the destruction of Jerusalem and exile, have a gap, and then pick up again fifty years later when some exiles were allowed to start returning to Israel. If an individual had such a gap in their personal story, one might suspect that they had suffered trauma that they could not remember or speak about. For ancient Israel, the loss of city, kingship and especially possession of the land was a communal  near death  experience that was virtually impossible for them to describe explicitly. <br /> <br /> When survivors of trauma find it difficult to talk directly about their trauma, they often find indirect ways to reflect and process their unspeakable experience. The exiles in Babylon did this by retelling the Moses story in ways that reflected their experience of loss, vulnerability, and communal near-annihilation. They set Moses's birth amidst crisis. The Egyptian Pharaoh develops a genocidal scheme to have midwives murder all newborn Israelite boy babies. <br /> <br /> When the midwives subversively undermine Pharaoh's order, he orders all Israelite babies be thrown in the Nile (Exodus 1:15-22). This is the situation when Moses is born to a couple in the Levitical tribe. Frightened at what might happen to her son, Moses' mother places her baby in a waterproofed basket and sets him adrift on the Nile River. In other words, the book of Exodus opens with slavery, infant genocide, and an individual mother's decision to let her baby son loose on a river, a form of possible infant exposure -- all related in the first chapter and a half! <br /> <br /> As the story continues, the character of Moses develops in ways that mirror his people's vulnerability. For example, after he has been set loose, as a three-month old baby on the mighty Nile, he is rescued by an Egyptian princess and grows up in an Egyptian household. The child Moses of this story thus lives like an exile amid foreigners, even as his mother is hired as his wet nurse (Exodus 2:5-9). The princess gives him an Egyptian name, Moses, but ironically this Egyptian woman explains his name in terms of Hebrew -- as reflecting the fact that she  drew out  (Hebrew mashah) Moses from the river water (Exodus 2:10). <br /> <br /> Here we see the cultural cross-currents that many exiles face while living as a cultural minority. They take on foreign names and/or customs while maintaining ties to their own cultures. In this exilic version of the story, Moses' mother can parent her son only secretly, and his name is a mix of the slaveowner's culture (Moses) and a Hebrew reinterpretation of it ( I drew him out of the water ). <br /> <br /> On one level this story of slavery, genocide, exposure, and secret parenting works powerfully as individual drama, but it would have resonated with exiles under forced labor in Babylon. By preserving and revising old narratives about Moses' endangerment as a baby and rescue from the Nile, these exiles could speak, from a safe distance, of their own suffering and hope.  <br /> Like much of the rest of the Old and New Testaments, the Moses story is saturated with experiences of profound suffering. <br /> <br /> That is part of what has made these stories so compelling to diverse communities over the centuries. Characters like Moses reflect the reality of violence faced by many who cherish these texts today. Christian Bale' comments about Moses, the individual, miss the power of these biblical texts about Moses to help generations of communities, past and present, survive such suffering and make sense of it.

"Finding Justice in the  Giving Season "	"Tis the season of giving. Right? From  Giving Tuesday  to Salvation Army bell ringers to frantic online donations or checks postmarked by Dec. 31, charitable giving spikes in December. <a href= http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=1360#.VIijw0ue_rM  target= _hplink >The Network for Good estimates</a> that 30 percent of annual giving occurs in December and 10 percent in the last three days of the year. Not surprisingly, non-profits that address direct service needs like clothing and food also see a spike in volunteerism during the holidays. It's a good feeling to share our own bounty at Christmas -- to help a family buy presents, or serve a meal at a soup kitchen. I do these things with my own family, its part of how we teach our children to love and serve others.<br /> <br /> Charity is one of the foundations of Christianity (along with faith and hope it is considered one of the three theological virtues). The word comes from the Latin  caritas  and is used in Christian theology as a way of describing the nature of God, often translated as  love.  Because it is meant to represent an altruistic love that symbolizes the love people have for others (as in love thy neighbor), we often think about charity as how we act towards others, particularly those who need help. Charity is also foundational to Judaism in the form of <em>tzedakah</em> and to Islam as <em>zakat</em>, or almsgiving. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.bls.gov/news.release/volun.nr0.htm  target= _hplink >According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, about 25 percent of Americans volunteered at least once for an organization in 2013. Through our money and our time we tutor children, work in soup kitchens, offer up our houses of worship and community centers for people to shower and sleep. We feed people, cloth people, visit them when they are sick, and do our best to help care for and express of our love, <em>caritas</em>, for our neighbors. <br /> <br /> Charity, however, is not enough to address the deep economic and social problems that face our communities. In addition to giving people clothes and food and helping them find shelter, we need to address the root problems that are causing poverty. We need to focus not just on charity but also on justice. Why? We've all heard the story about teaching people to fish instead of giving them a fish and that begins to get at justice. But what if the pond is polluted and all the fish have died? Or what if there are giant trawlers that have cleaned out all the fish and sold them at a profit, leaving none behind for our fisher to catch and feed his or her family? A justice approach is interested in figuring out why all the fish died and how to make sure that our fisherperson is able to take care of their own needs and the needs of their family. Addressing the root causes of poverty is an essential aspect of effective social change.  <br /> <br /> The crisis of inequality that we face in our country rivals the days of the Robber Barons and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. A serious job and income crisis faces increasing numbers of poor and low-income families in our country. Work that pays a living wage has slowly evaporated from our economy over the last twenty years. Many poor and low-income people are eager and ready for work but their skills are obsolete or their industries have collapsed and the work that they can find doesn't feed their families, or pay their rent, or keep the lights on. <br /> <br /> The number of <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/upshot/unemployment-the-vanishing-male-worker-how-america-fell-behind.html?emc=edit_th_20141212&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=21693736&_r=0&abt=0002&abg=0  target= _hplink >prime-age men (25-54 years old) not working stands at 16 percent </a>, that's triple the number since the late '60s. <a href= http://www.nwlc.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/final_nwlc_lowwagereport2014.pdf  target= _hplink >Two-thirds of low-wage workers are women</a> (defined as $10.10 an hour or less) and one-third of these women are mothers of children under 18.<br /> <br /> Charity is an important and necessary part of a caring society. Charity helps people make it through the hard times and get back on their feet. So, by all means, keep giving food, money and clothes to help folks make through the tough times.<br /> <br /> But don't stop there. <br /> <br /> We need to develop justice responses to the social and economic crises that threaten the well being of our communities. During this Giving Season, think about where you are giving your time and money. In addition to the organizations that offer charity, find and give (time and money) to organizations in your community that are working toward social change. Community development organizations that work in partnership with people from poor and marginalized communities to create innovative justice-oriented solutions to their problems need and deserve your support -- year round. Find these organizations in your local community and give generously. After all, it's the Giving Season. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 15:36:51 -0500"	"religion"

"There Is Nothing Casual About Prejudice: The Popular Podcast 'Serial' and the Notion of Implicit Bias"	"Like <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/07/serial-adnan-syed-family-podcast-interview  target= _hplink >millions</a> of others, I have been an avid listener of the new podcast<em> Serial</em>.  Its <a href= http://serialpodcast.org/  target= _hplink > one story, told week by week  </a>is the true case of Adnan Syed, who was convicted of and is serving life in prison for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee.  Host and executive producer Sarah Koenig analyzes the evidence and lack thereof, transcripts of the interrogations and two trials, and presents recent interviews of witnesses, former classmates, family, jurors, and Adnan himself.  Koenig seems to genuinely vacillate between believing Adnan is innocent and guilty, and early in the podcast she invites listeners to start paying attention if we want to solve this mystery with her.<br /> <br /> Adnan is a Pakistani American, and Hae was Korean American.  The racial and cultural identities of the protagonists have prompted some to <a href= http://www.theawl.com/2014/11/serial-and-white-reporter-privilege  target= _hplink >characterize the podcast as an  immigrant story,  and to criticize</a> Koenig for not grasping many aspects of this narrative.  While I agree with this analysis, I did not think it ultimately compromised Koenig's role as an effective storyteller.  That is, until I heard Episode 10.<br /> <br /> About five minutes into Episode 10, Koenig is interviewing Adnan's mother, who tells Koenig that she believes her son was convicted because he is Muslim.  I was surprised to hear Koenig say right away that she does not believe her.  But then Koenig seems to take a step back by stating that prejudice may have  crept in  and contributed to the way the case was investigated and prosecuted,  advertently or inadvertently.   She goes on to provide striking examples of gratuitous, suggestive, and plainly stereotypical references to Pakistani or Muslim men.  I began to forgive Koenig for immediately dismissing Adnan's mother's perspective when she seemed to get the harm of this prejudice, exclaiming that one can  stir stereotypes into facts, all of which gets baked into a story. <br /> <br /> But then Koenig downplays the injustice that can result from such sordid story making.  About 15 minutes in she says,  Reporting this story I found plenty of examples of casual prejudice against Muslims.   Koenig goes on to cite comments by Adnan's former teachers and interviews of some of the jurors who voted to convict Adnan.  As for the jurors, Koenig presents their claim that while they had stereotypes about Adnan's religion, it  didn't affect their view of the case.   However, Koenig states that when she pressed, it seemed for some of the jurors  stereotypes of Adnan's culture were there, lurking in the background.   She then plays recorded interviews of two jurors who explain that views of how Muslim men treat women seemed to play a part in how some saw the case.  Nonetheless, Koenig switches to discussing Adnan's defense attorney and describes the amount of time the attorney dedicated in the opening statement to explaining Adnan's religion and culture as  nutty. <br /> <br /> The fact that Koenig identifies how racial and cultural stereotypes were present in Adnan's case but then dismisses this as  casual  is frustrating and troubling.  Casual prejudice is not an actual phenomenon.  It is not a defined phrase or term of art.  There is, however, a proven concept called  implicit bias,  and it is currently part of the national discourse in the wake of the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and other Black and Brown civilians killed by police officers.  Referring to <a href= http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/research/understanding-implicit-bias/  target= _hplink > the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner, </a> many are pointing out how implicit bias plays a role in police brutality.  There is the dehumanizing language in <a href= http://time.com/3605346/darren-wilson-michael-brown-demon/  target= _hplink >Darren Wilson's grand jury testimony</a> describing Michael Brown as a  demon  and  Hulk-Hogan like.   There have been discussions about <a href= http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/03/black-boys-older.aspx  target= _hplink >a report </a>released earlier this year revealing that the police perceive young Black men to be less innocent than their White counterparts, and also older than they actually are (the officer who killed 12-year-old Rice thought Rice was 20).  <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/08/across-america-whites-are-biased-and-they-dont-even-know-it/  target= _hplink >A <em>Washington Post</em> article this week</a> discusses an implicit bias study and declares that  across America, Whites are biased and they don't even know it. <br /> <br /> Koenig uses the concept of casual prejudice to cast the biases of jurors and other key actors in Adnan's case as not dispositive -- that it did not ultimately impact the outcome.  It is not clear why Koenig is so certain, but her characterization of the prejudice against Adnan as  casual  calls into question her credibility.  Prejudice is conscious, or it can be implicit.  It is pervasive.  Prejudice in the U.S. <a href= http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet  target= _hplink >incarcerates </a>and <a href= http://www.propublica.org/article/deadly-force-in-black-and-white  target= _hplink >kills</a> people of color at disproportionate rates.

"Spike in Tiny Number of Gay Men on PrEP Abandoning Condoms Hardly Represents 'All' Gay Men"	"<a href= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2014/12/hiv-aids-prep-truvada-condom-gilead-gild.html?s=print  target= _hplink >A Dec. 8 blog post in the <em>San Francisco Business Times</em></a> has sparked another furor over gay men using the HIV drug Truvada to prevent infection with the deadly virus.  San Francisco men shed condoms in favor of Gilead's HIV prevention pill,  alleges the title of <em>SFBT</em> reporter Ron Leuty's opinion piece.<br /> <br /> Leuty reported on a survey of men in a Kaiser Permanente AIDS-prevention program. More than 500 are taking Truvada once a day as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Leuty called the 45-percent increase among men in the study not using condoms  eye-popping  -- which it is. Clearly these men aren't heeding the <a href= http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/guidelines/PrEPguidelines2014.pdf  target= _hplink >Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation</a> to use condoms in addition to taking the drug.<br /> <br /> But it's a serious stretch to project the behavior of about 90 men on PrEP in this one study to  all  gay men in San Francisco, let alone anywhere else. Consider this: All 500 men in the study represent only about 0.007861 of San Francisco's roughly 60,000 or so gay and bisexual men.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there will always be men who push the limits of risk to engage in high-risk sex that is, for them, something of value. Others of us may see it as self-harm, but these guys usually describe it in terms of intimacy and pleasure. Either way, we should be glad these men are making even a partial effort to protect themselves by taking PrEP.<br /> <br /> We can argue all we want about whether PrEP provides cover for dangerous behavior. But we aren't addressing the most important questions: Why do some gay men value high-risk sex more highly than they apparently value their own health? Why do some guys seem unable to value themselves apart from their willingness to engage in  anything goes  sex?<br /> <br /> At risk of getting stuck trying to understand what even mental-health experts would likely classify as aberrant behavior, I would suggest we step back to get a more accurate picture of how the vast majority of gay men conduct their sex lives. Reframe the statistics that can be blown out of proportion to make it look like  all  gay men have stopped using condoms, or even like  all  gay men engage in anal intercourse, which they don't.<br /> <br /> Ron Stall, Director of the LGBT Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh, has identified four interconnected  epidemics  of psychosocial health conditions that disproportionately afflict gay and bisexual men, each one making the other worse: childhood sexual abuse, partner violence, depression, and drug use. Together, their insidious effects are referred to as syndemics. Men who are most strongly affected by any one of these tend to be at high risk for HIV and substance abuse. Those from lower-income or culturally marginalized ethnic groups are especially vulnerable to syndemic effects.<br /> <br /> In <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12773359  target= _hplink >one study</a>, Stall and his colleagues found that 11 percent of 812 men who reported one problem -- depression, for instance -- had engaged in high-risk sex. Of 129 men who reported three or four problems, 23 percent said they had had high-risk sex.<br /> <br /> The numbers are high relative to the so-called general population. But surely no one can be surprised to see self-destructive behavior in people treated as if they don't deserve better. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the numbers tell us something quite astonishing when we look at them from a different angle: that 89 percent of the men reporting one problem did <em>not</em> engage in high-risk sex. Likewise, more than three quarters of the men with three or four problems did <em>not</em> engage in high-risk sex.<br /> <br /> These numbers make it clear: The overwhelming majority of gay men are resilient and take care of, protect, and value ourselves. How can this be? In the face of overwhelming pressures and struggles that can give gay men all the reasons we might need to harm or medicate ourselves, how is it that most of us <em>don't</em>?<br /> <br /> The short answer: We accept ourselves. Research suggests that our journey toward being resilient gay men who accept and value ourselves begins by accepting our sexual orientation -- overcoming our own self-stigma, what we've internalized from the bullies of our lives. Ron Stall told me in an <a href= http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/02/the-power-of-choosing-resilience/273245/?single_page=true  target= _hplink >interview for <em>The Atlantic</em></a>,  Guys who do the best job of resolving internalized homophobia [or self-stigma] are the least likely to have current victimization, substance abuse, and compulsive [high-risk] sex. <br /> <br /> Put a little differently, he said,  Getting a population of people to not hate themselves is good for their health. This is not rocket science.  Building up, and upon, gay men's resilience is a challenge for each of us -- and for our families, lawmakers, ministers, teachers, and anyone else who wishes us to be well and fully contributing members of society. <br /> <br /> The place to start is in revising the way we think. We need to consider carefully how numbers can hurt us when they are taken out of context. Their  eye-popping  shock value dwindles when they're put into perspective against the bigger number of  all  gay men.<br /> <br /> We can hope that gay men who value condomless sex more than they do their own lives will eventually find intimacy and pleasure in sex built upon mutual respect and protection. Until then, PrEP for them is an important step in protecting themselves.<br /> <br /> In the meantime, the vast majority of gay men -- who don't abuse drugs or engage in high-risk sex -- clearly value their health enough not to endanger themselves or their partners.<br /> <br /> Yes it's shocking to realize that <a href= http://sfaf.org/hiv-info/statistics/  target= _hplink >one in four gay men in San Francisco is HIV-positive</a>. <br /> <br /> But it's at least as surprising that 75 percent of gay men in San Francisco are not HIV-positive. What can we learn from them about how they have avoided HIV when the virus is so prevalent in the community? What can their experience show us that might even help the guys taking an expensive, powerful, and toxic drug so they can engage in high-risk sex?<br /> <br /> Among the lessons, one stands out: Just as the way we frame our personal story can make us feel like a victim of our circumstances or a victor over them, so too the way we present statistics  can mean the difference between hope and despair. Increases in condomless sex among a tiny sliver of men already at extreme risk for HIV may be  eye-popping.  But so is the far greater number of gay men who choose to view safer sex as the key to real intimacy and pleasure between men who care about themselves and one another.

"Attorney General Won't Force New York Times Reporter To Reveal Source"	"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has ruled out forcing New York Times reporter James Risen to divulge his source in the upcoming trial of a former CIA officer accused of disclosing government secrets, a person familiar with the matter said Friday night.<br /> <br /> The decision comes ahead of a court hearing set for next week at which Justice Department prosecutors had been directed to reveal whether they plan to seek Risen's testimony. The person briefed on the matter, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the decision had not yet been formally announced, said the Justice Department may still subpoena Risen to answer other questions in the case but would not compel him to disclose the identity of his source.<br /> <br /> Risen's reporting has been at the center of a years-long conflict with the federal government that has contributed to a debate about the line between national security and press freedoms.<br /> <br /> Prosecutors allege that Jeffrey Sterling, who is scheduled for trial next month in federal court in Virginia, was a key source in Risen's 2006 book  State of War,  which detailed a botched CIA effort during the Clinton administration to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. Risen has refused to reveal his sources despite being subpoenaed by the government and did not testify before the federal grand jury that indicted Sterling in 2010.<br /> <br /> The trial has long been delayed while lawyers have debated whether Risen enjoys any kind of immunity from being compelled to testify about his interactions with anonymous sources. In June, the Supreme Court let stand a ruling from a federal appellate court that Risen could be subpoenaed and rejected his bid to get the justices to clarify whether journalists have a right to protect their confidential sources.<br /> <br /> It's not clear what the Justice Department's decision will mean for the case against Sterling, which is set for trial on Jan. 12.<br /> <br />  We are waiting for the formal response as ordered by the court,  one of Sterling's lawyers, Edward MacMahon, wrote in an emailed statement.  If the result is that the Attorney General does not want to issue the subpoena that his own Department of Justice fought for all the way to the Supreme Court, then three years of Mr. Sterling's life have been wasted in litigation. <br /> <br /> Attorney General Eric Holder has said no reporter would be sent to jail for doing his or her job, but he has faced repeated criticism for the Justice Department's handling of national security leak investigations during his tenure.<br /> <br /> In 2013, the government secretly subpoenaed records of telephone lines used by AP journalists as part of its investigation into who leaked information for a 2012 story about a foiled plot in Yemen to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner. The Justice Department also secretly used a warrant to obtain the emails of a Fox News reporter, a decision Holder singled out in October as one he wished  could have been done differently. <br /> <br /> The fallout of those cases led the Justice Department to issue new guidelines for obtaining records from news media organizations in leak investigations.<br /> <br /> In the Risen matter, Holder had said he was optimistic that the situation could be defused in an acceptable way for both sides.<br /> <br /> Earlier this week, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ordered prosecutors to state at a Dec. 16 hearing whether they planned to call Risen as a witness and also asked them to reveal  any conditions or limitations  they had worked out with his attorneys.  She said the Justice Department has had more than six months to decide whether it would subpoena Risen to testify at trial.<br /> <br />  Because Mr. Risen's presence or absence at the trial will have a significant impact on how the parties present their case, a decision about Mr. Risen must be made sufficiently before trial to enable the parties to prepare adequately,  she wrote in the order.<br /> <br /> An email message sent to Risen was not immediately returned.<br /> <br /> The Justice Department's decision was first reported by NBC News.<br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP"	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 19:04:43 -0500"	"media"
"'We Tortured Some Folks,' But 'That's Not Who We Are'"	"Last August, President Barack Obama admitted to the press: <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/obama-cia-torture-some-folks-brennan-spying  target= _hplink > we tortured some folks. </a>  But he also added that torturing people  is not who we are.   His CIA director, <a href= http://www.c-span.org/video/?323254-1/cia-director-john-brennan-interrogation-report  target= _hplink >John Brennan</a>, calls the CIA torturers  patriots.  So which is it? Are they  patriots,  deserving of our admiration, or sadists who engaged in acts that are contrary to  who we are? <br /> <br /> The Senate Intelligence Committee's executive summary <a href= https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1376748/sscistudy1.pdf  target= _hplink >report </a> on CIA torture concludes that at least 26 of the people the CIA contractors tortured were <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/middle-east-cia-torture-report_n_6303538.html  target= _hplink >innocent of <a href= http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/12/09/249465/senate-finds-cia-brutalized-terror.html  target= _hplink >any ties</a> to terrorism </a>whatsoever. <br /> <br /> One of the CIA contractors,<a href= http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/11/politics/enhanced-interrogation-architect-speaks/index.html?hpt=hp_t2  target= _hplink > James Mitchell</a>, was on TV lately where he was called the  architect  of the torture program.  His Spokane, Washington company, Mitchell, Jessen, and Associates, <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/world/senate-torture-report-shows-cia-infighting-over-interrogation-program.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >received $81 million</a> in taxpayer money for services rendered.  <br /> <br /> CIA Director<a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/us/politics/cia-director-brennan-torture-report.html  target= _hplink > John Brennan</a> argues that people like Mitchell and his business partner, Bruce Jessen, were doing legitimate intelligence work.  But isn't it also possible that these  patriots  were acting out their post-9/11 revenge fantasies against a bunch of Arabs and Afghans who fell into their clutches about whom they knew very little?<br /> <br /> Mitchell and Jessen had <a href= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2869650/Anti-terror-program-leaders-little-experience.html  target= _hplink >no specialized knowledge</a> of Al Qaeda or international terrorism; they didn't speak Arabic or Pashto, and had no experience interrogating prisoners. <br /> <br /> What <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryancasey/cia-interrogation-program_b_6299398.html  target= _hplink >they did know about </a>as psychologists was how to drill down into the human psyche.  And they knew how to <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/12/us/12psychs.html?pagewanted=all  target= _hplink >reverse engineer </a>the Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) techniques designed to help U.S. personnel counter torturers. They applied the same appalling techniques to their own interrogations. Given their lack of qualifications to head such an endeavor it's likely Mitchell and Jessen were just winging it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Can we get our $81 million back?</strong><br /> <br /> George W. Bush and Dick Cheney might have  authorized  the torture program, but it's still a war crime that violates the <a href= http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html  target= _hplink >Convention Against Torture</a>, the United Nations Charter, the <a href= http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/  target= _hplink >Universal Declaration of Human Rights,</a> and the U.S. Constitution.  Letting the people responsible for torture ride off into the sunset free of any criminal charges throws out the window international and domestic law, as well as almost everything we've learned from the Nuremberg Trials, Hannah Arendt, or the trial of Adolf Eichmann. <br /> <br /> One of the CIA's <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/rise-and-fall-of-cias-overseas-prisons-traced-in-senate-report-on-interrogations/2014/12/11/067232b4-8143-11e4-9f38-95a187e4c1f7_story.html  target= _hplink > black  (secret) torture sites </a>was located at Guantanamo, which should raise some thorny legal issues because, unlike Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Afghanistan, or Thailand, the Supreme Court has ruled that<a href= http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/the_obama_gitmo_myth/  target= _hplink > Guantanamo is considered  U.S. soil.  </a> <br /> <br /> Absent any criminal prosecutions, the only conclusion we will be left with is that these guys really are  patriots  and torturing people really is  who we are.   But we shouldn't need  experts  like <a href= http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2014/12/10/the-torture-report-and-american-values/  target= _hplink >Max Boot</a>, <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/feb/04/usa.afghanistan  target= _hplink >Joe Klein</a>, or other apologists for torture to judge the morality of turning to torturers posing as  doctors  to root out suspected terrorists.  <br /> <br /> The morality and ethics of whether or not the CIA can torture people in our name are non-negotiable. There is no argument that can be made to justify this atrocity. The corporate media are treating torture as if it's just another  issue  like immigration reform or the federal budget. It isn't. You cannot justify the unjustifiable. People who attempt to apologize for torture done in their name are embarrassing themselves; raising their heads to be counted as <a href= http://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/208  target= _hplink >barbarians</a> at the gate. <br /> <br /> We don't fight against terrorists to become more like them, but to maintain our differences.  And after all of the criticism the Arab and Islamic world has gotten for being behind the West in embracing the Enlightenment from the <a href= http://www.salon.com/2014/11/21/reza_aslan_sam_harris_and_new_atheists_arent_new_arent_even_atheists/  target= _hplink >Sam Harrises</a> and <a href= http://www.salon.com/2014/10/12/bill_mahers_horrible_excuse_why_his_defense_of_islamophobia_just_doesnt_make_any_sense/  target= _hplink >Bill Mahers</a>, our own government tossed out any semblance of Enlightenment thinking against torturing prisoners going back to <a href= http://gradstudentmadness.blogspot.com/2005/11/voltaire-on-torture.html  target= _hplink >Voltaire</a> and Beccaria. <br /> <br /> Not long ago <a href= http://www.alandershowitz.com/publications/docs/torturewarrants.html  target= _hplink >Alan Dershowitz </a>was advocating  torture warrants,  whereby judges could issue a legal justification for torture.  I suppose that would be better than what we had: the CIA acting in secret and employing contractors to torture people willy-nilly.  <br /> <br /> Mitchell and Jessen and their underlings weren't going after any  ticking time bombs.   They wanted to use coercion to get the names of other potential bad guys. The Senate report shows that they routinely kept prisoners in solitary confinement in a dark hole for up to <a href= http://globalnews.ca/news/1717407/how-the-cia-tortured-its-guinea-pig-detainee-abu-zubaydah/  target= _hplink >47 days</a> just to  soften them up  before asking them any questions.  So much for disarming the  ticking time bomb.   The report also shows that any real intelligence gleaned from the interrogations came <em>before</em> prisoners were subjected to torture.   <br /> <br /> One of the <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-worst-findings-waterboard-rectal  target= _hplink >creepiest revelations </a>from the Senate report is the description of a torturer who has broken down one of his subjects through water-boarding and other  techniques  to the point where he can merely raise an eyebrow or snap his fingers and that broken human being would willingly go over to the water board and strap himself in. That's straight out of Orwell's <em>1984</em>.  <br /> <br /> Mitchell and Jessen (and a number of other agents who are still receiving government salaries) engaged in  interrogating  their prisoners with beatings, stress positions, sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, dark and cold or light and hot environments, rectal feeding, rectal hydration, sensory overload or sensory deprivation, and any other humiliating abuse that leapt into their imaginations.<br /> <br /> One prisoner under their charge <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/09/the-most-gruesome-moments-in-the-cia-torture-report.html  target= _hplink >died of hypothermia </a>on a cold concrete floor after being shackled to a post stripped of his pants.      <br /> <br /> The torture report sort of gave the country another  teachable moment.   But will we learn anything other than how <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/11/jon-stewart-awesome-andrea-tantaros_n_6306844.html  target= _hplink > awesome </a> is the United States?<br /> <br /> In recent news cycles since the report was made public we've seen the corporate media clearly go in <a href= http://fair.org/take-action/action-alerts/equal-time-for-torturers/  target= _hplink >damage control mode.</a>  The networks and cable TV stations apparently see it as their responsibility to provide journalistic  balance,  as if torture is just another  issue  to bloviate about with talking points and a bifurcated  pro  and  con  frame.  They bring on their shows people like former CIA director <a href= http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/michael-hayden-cia-rectal-rehydration-113515.html  target= _hplink >Michael Hayden </a>(who has lied to Congress) and other torture apologists and propagandists to spin the story out of existence.<br /> <br /> During the George W. Bush years there was a brief public debate about whether or not waterboarding was  torture.   The late <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/02/ivanity-fairis-christophe_n_110444.html  target= _hplink >Christopher Hitchens</a>, who was an important intellectual cheerleader for the Iraq War and an advocate for an aggressive  war on terror  wasn't convinced that waterboarding was torture so he agreed to have it done to him.  A few other reporters also willingly subjected themselves to waterboarding as a publicity stunt to  see what it was like.   I doubt if any pro-torture reporter or intellectual would agree to undergo rectal feeding as Hitchens did with waterboarding to find out if it's really  torture.   We won't see <a href= http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/12/torture-party-republicans.html  target= _hplink >Dick Cheney </a>on teevee with a blender and an enema bag any time soon.  <br /> <br /> <strong>I'll ask again: Can we get our $81 million back?</strong><br /> <br /> The United States claims to uphold  universal  values such as democracy and human rights while trampling the principle of  universalism,  which holds that all nations, big or small, powerful or weak, must respect international law.  Allowing CIA career employees or contractors to get away with torturing people free from legal accountability telegraphs to the rest of the world that the United States reserves unto itself the right to commit war crimes.<br /> <br /> Back in the 1920s and 1930s, the <a href= http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-mussolini  target= _hplink >Italian fascists</a> used to attack the gastrointestinal tracts of their left-wing opponents by pouring castor oil down their throats or administering castor oil enemas.  Rectal feeding to punish and humiliate has been around for a while; but the trains ran on time.  <br /> <br /> Since it appears that the CIA torturers never will be brought to justice it makes it more likely that sometime in the future, with the nation facing a new peril, a different cast of  patriots  might direct these kinds of  enhanced interrogation techniques  closer to home.  Maybe next time their targets won't be foreigners suspected of terrorism but will be American citizens who hold political views they don't like.  And the black sites, instead of being located in places like Lithuania or Poland, might be in Peoria or Tulsa. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 17:18:46 -0500"	"media"
"Conflicts of Interest in Coverage of a Health Issue by the New York Times"	"In recent days, employees of <em>The New York Times</em> have posted no fewer than three pieces on the newspaper's website, asserting that the risk of harm from the electromagnetic fields (EMF) given off by power lines is negligible, and that fears of it are unfounded. Among the postings is a seven-minute <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/health/long-after-an-80s-scare-suspicion-of-power-lines-prevails.html  target= _hplink >video</a> produced by Kyra Darnton for Retro Report, entitled  Long After an 80's Scare, Suspicion of Power Lines Prevails.  An accompanying article with the same title has been posted by a reporter for Retro Report named Clyde Haberman, and a third <a href= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/a-fresh-look-at-power-lines-cancer-and-the-dread-to-risk-ratio/  target= _hplink >piece</a> entitled  A Fresh Look at Power Lines, Cancer and the Dread-to-Risk Ratio  has been put up by a reporter for the newspaper named Andrew C. Revkin.<br /> <br /> The video produced by Darnton and some colleagues at Retro Report relies preponderantly on the testimony of two researchers -- David Savitz, who is vice-president for research at Brown University, and John Moulder, director of radiation biology at the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Medical College of Wisconsin.<br /> <br /> Early in <a href= http://microwavenews.com/news-center/times-retroreport-power-lines  target= _hplink >his career</a>, Savitz conducted studies showing that children living in homes near power lines were developing leukemia twice as often as children who did not live in such homes. Later, he received a five-million-dollar contract from the Electric Power Research Institute -- an organization financed by the electric utility industry -- to study the risk of cancer among electric utility workers. Savitz found an increased risk of brain tumors in these workers, but he subsequently renounced this finding and challenged similar findings on the part of other researchers. He also renounced his finding of increased leukemia in children exposed to power-line electromagnetic fields, and challenged similar findings by other researchers. In Darnton's video, he declares,  it's quite questionable whether these fields cause leukemia at all. <br /> <br /> Savitz has every right to renounce his work on electromagnetic fields, and to challenge the validity of studies conducted by other researchers, but is it good journalistic practice for Darnton and her colleagues at <em>The Times</em> to omit any mention of the fact that he has received heavy financing from the electric utility industry?<br /> <br /> John Moulder, who, like Savitz, also plays a leading role in Darnton's video, tells its viewers that the  Current state of the science says power lines cannot be a major public health hazard.  <br /> <br /> Moulder has every right to express such an opinion, but is it good journalistic practice for Darnton and her colleagues to omit any mention of the fact that he has testified repeatedly as a <a href= http://microwavenews.com/news-center/%E2%80%9Cradiation-research%E2%80%9D-and-cult-negative-results#Moulder  target= _hplink >paid consultant</a> for the electric utility industry that electromagnetic fields given off by power lines do not pose any health risk?<br /> <br /> As for Moulder's assessment of the current state of scientific research regarding the power-line health hazard, how in the name of any claim to objectivity could Darnton and her colleagues omit mention of a <a href= http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs322/en/  target= _hplink >report</a> issued by a panel of scientists convened by the prestigious International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), in Lyon, France, whose twenty-five members reviewed the findings of dozens of studies of childhood leukemia victims and the proximity of where they lived to power lines, and concluded unanimously that power-frequency magnetic fields are  possibly carcinogenic to humans ? (Among the members of the panel were representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the National Radiological Protection Board, the Yale University Medical School, and the World Health Organization.) <br /> <br /> The answer to this question is that Darnton and her colleagues did not try to find out if there was any evidence to cast doubt upon the conclusion that exonerates power-line electromagnetic fields of posing any health risk. If they had seen fit to contact me -- the author of half a dozen articles about the EMF hazard in <em>The New Yorker</em> -- or Louis Slesin, the editor and publisher of <a href= http://microwavenews.com/  target= _hplink >Microwave News</a> -- a meticulously researched newsletter that has carried information about the health hazards posed by EMFs and microwave radiation for more than thirty years -- they could easily have learned about the conflicts of interest that may well taint the views of Savitz and Moulder, as well as about the unanimous findings of the IARC report.<br /> <br /> (Disclosure: I appear in Darnton's video giving a three-second answer to a question asked by Tex Koppel during a <em>Nightline</em> program about EMFs that aired back in the early 1990s. Both Louis Slesin and I have written letters to Margaret Sullivan, Public Editor of <em>The Times</em>, pointing out the conflicts of interest on the part of Savitz and Moulder, and the necessity of acknowledging such conflicts when reporting on public health issues.)<br /> <br /> This is not the only time that <em>The New York Times</em> has failed to inform its readers adequately about the existence of a major public health risk. During a twenty-year period between the 1960s and 1980s, I wrote a number of articles for <em>The New Yorker</em> about the massive health hazard posed by exposure to asbestos, as well as the extensive toxic tort litigation being brought in jurisdictions around the nation by sick and dying asbestos workers and the families of dead workers against asbestos manufacturers, who had concealed the hazard for half a century -- in some cases, neglecting to inform their workers when X-ray examinations revealed that they had developed fatal lung disease. During that whole period, <em>The Times</em> carried articles about the asbestos problem on its business pages, and often referred to asbestos as an  alleged carcinogen,  thus conferring legal rights upon a mineral that had killed or disabled tens of thousands of American workers, and been shown to be the most important industrial cause of cancer in the world. Moreover, <em>The Times</em> invariably  balanced  the findings of researchers whose studies had demonstrated that asbestos was carcinogenic with denials issued by researchers financed by the asbestos industry. <br /> <br /> Only when the nation's largest asbestos company, Johns-Manville, filed for bankruptcy on August 26, 1982 -- an event brought about because juries around the nation had found the company guilty of outrageous and reckless misconduct, and levied millions of dollars in punitive damages against it -- did the story find its way to the front page of <em>The Times</em>.<br /> <br /> A day later, an editorial writer for the newspaper proved to be so ignorant of the fifty-year cover-up of asbestos disease by the nation's asbestos manufacturers that he compared the human agony they had visited upon their workers with the fiscal uncertainty besetting them.  Asbestos is a tragedy,  he wrote,  most of all for the victims and their families but also for companies, which are being made to pay the price for decisions made long ago. <br /> <br /> Asbestos proved to be a powerful carcinogen that inflicted cancer and other disease upon workers who inhaled its fibers in occupational settings. It also posed a health hazard for people in the general population, who were exposed to asbestos insulation that had been sprayed as fireproofing on the girders of buildings -- a practiced now banned nationwide.  Studies of power-frequency electromagnetic fields show them to be are a far weaker carcinogen than asbestos, but also demonstrate that they pose a cancer hazard for telephone linemen, electric utility workers, and workers exposed to EMF emanating from electrically powered equipment and machinery. As for children and people in the general population, a glance along any street in the United States should be sufficient to show that power-line EMFs are ubiquitous in the environment, and to serve as a warning that their potential to cause widespread harm should not be ignored or denied.<br /> <br /> One might have hoped that <em>The Times</em> had learned by now to inform its readers about conflicts of interest that could skew the accuracy of its reports on matters relating to the public health. However, judging from Darnton's video and the pieces by Haberman and Revkin, who have rubber stamped its flawed conclusions, one would have been mistaken to do so.<br /> <br /> One might hope that in the future <em>The Times</em> will inform its readers regarding conflicts of interest in people it presents as reliable sources, so readers may make better-informed decisions about the information being transmitted to them.<br /> <br /> Don't bet on it.

"5 Tips to Improve Your Campus Rape-Reporting Experience"	"Everyone seems to give women great--and by  great  we mean terrible--<a href= http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/20/justice/colorado-rape-prevention-guidelines/  target= _hplink >advice these days</a> for how to prevent college rape. And as you probably know, college rape isn't abating--indeed, it seems a new story breaks weekly that's more horrifying than the last. Because there's a good chance that you or someone you know will be raped while you're in college, we decided to provide some actually useful advice. <br /> <br /> Since reporting rape is unfortunately an activity with which both of us (<a href= http://the-toast.net/2014/09/16/counted-reporting-rape-school-title-ix-investigation/  target= _hplink >Katie</a> and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/annie-e-clark/why-i-am-filing-an-office_b_2489641.html  target= _hplink >Annie</a>) are familiar, we've compiled our own list of  tips  for when you or a friend is ready to report your rape. <br /> <br /> <em>Content Warning: The following tips may look shockingly similar to the terrible advice that women are routinely given to avoid getting raped. That's on purpose.<br /> </em><br /> <strong>1. Put on your Rape-Reporting Face</strong><br /> <br /> Since your <a href= http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=6065  target= _hplink >anti-rape face</a> failed to prevent your rape, it's time to work on your rape-reporting face. A rape-reporting face must convey a variety of emotions at once, so getting it right is going to take some practice. You must look sad, but not so weepy that you're unreliable. You must seem frightened, but not so frightened that you might have traumatic memory loss. If you come across too cold, your listeners might think you're inventing the rape because you're vengeful. <br /> <br /> If you cry too much and seem out of control, you might be <a href= http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=authors/angie-epifano  target= _hplink >headed for a psychiatric facility</a>. This is why we recommend the ten-to-twenty tear rule. Keep your number of tears in the ten-to-twenty range, and you'll be fine.<br /> <br /> If figuring out the correct rape-reporting face seems difficult, you're right! Basically, it's nearly impossible to get a rape-reporting face right unless you're Meryl Streep with multiple Oscars. You should still try, though, because how you come across to the police and school administrators often determines whether they take your case seriously. Be sure to <a href= http://mic.com/articles/102980/college-tells-female-students-to-practice-their-anti-rape-faces-in-the-mirror  target= _hplink >practice in the mirror</a> before you go. <br /> <br /> <strong>2. Dress Appropriately </strong><br /> <br /> Nothing you were wearing last night, not even your <a href= http://www.buzzfeed.com/alisonvingiano/these-college-students-are-making-a-nail-polish-that-changes  target= _hplink >anti-rape nail polish</a>, could prevent your rape. <br /> <br /> Now you need to think about what to wear when you report your rape. Definitely avoid yoga pants and dresses. You won't want to feel like anyone is looking at your body because after you are raped you will want to feel like you are dead. Additionally, if you  look pretty,  the people at the rape reporting office might say that  you were asking for it  and tell you to dress more modestly. <br /> <br /> Remember this rule: Old sweats = rape wear. Find the largest, most shapeless sweatsuit that you can, ideally one cut for a man. Furthermore, the sweatshirt will need to be of the hoodie variety. That way, when you <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/06/is-columbia-failing-campus-rape-victims.html  target= _hplink >pass your rapist on campus</a>, you can pull up your hood and hide your face.<br /> <br /> Don't have a hoodie? It's OK! University police have suggested that <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/21/uconn-sexual-assault-complaint_n_4133713.html  target= _hplink >certain hats</a> work just as well for fending off unwanted attention from rapists. <br /> <br /> <strong>3. Bring a Buddy</strong><br /> <br /> The <a href= http://safercampus.org/userfiles/file/NASummaryReport.pdf  target= _hplink >buddy system</a> obviously failed you when you got raped. Where was your buddy during your date with the guy you thought was kind and trustworthy? Couldn't she have sat on the edge of the bed and read <em>Marie Claire</em> while you guys got it on and made sure nothing rapey happened? <br /> <br /> Well, too late now. It's time to break out the rape-reporting buddy system. Reporting your rape is easier when you bring a friend. But what friend should you bring? This is a tough decision. Let's start with your buddy's sex--do you bring a girl friend or a guy friend? You're going to be talking with total strangers about violent sexual acts that happened to your body. Having a guy friend there might make you even more uncomfortable. But, people listen to men--men have  <a href= http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/katie-couric-some-said-i-lacked-gravitas-which-ive-since-decided-is-latin-for-testicles_b128981  target= _hplink >gravitas</a> --so bringing along a guy might make your rape report more credible.<br /> <br /> But if talking about sex acts in front of a guy friend is just too much for your post-assault-self to handle (it was for us), then you have to select a girl friend. But which one? Your friend who could take on three drunk guys in a bar with her bare hands and leave them crying on the floor? She'll stand up for you if you get bullied during the reporting process. But--here's a strange thing--college administrators are secretly afraid of you. You can make their school look bad or <a href= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/11/university_of_virginia_gang_rape_investigation_rolling_stone_reveals_limits.html  target= _hplink >start a media firestorm</a>, which is their worst nightmare. Bringing an intimidating friend along might actually make them be less helpful to you. <br /> <br /> So do you bring your quiet, meeker friend, who will let you do all the talking and hold your hand? She's loyal and kind. But what happens when they blame you and ask you how rape is possible <a href= http://jezebel.com/23-students-file-complaint-against-columbia-for-mishand-1567215473  target= _hplink >without proper lubrication</a>? Will she stand up for you? <br /> <br /> If you're starting to feel like you can't win, that's because you can't! Administrators really don't want to hear about you being raped. They wish it didn't happen almost as much as you do--just for different reasons. They might try to talk you out of reporting to the police. They might try to convince you that it didn't happen like you thought it did--especially if your rapist is <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/16/sports/errors-in-inquiry-on-rape-allegations-against-fsu-jameis-winston.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >a famous athlete</a>. <br /> <br /> So whatever you do, don't go alone. <br /> <br /> <strong>4. Ask for a Better Rape Whistle</strong><br /> <br /> You will want to show the people at the campus rape reporting office that you are serious about not making yourself a target. So ask for a better rape whistle. According to at least one college, the best rape whistles are made of a  <a href= http://www.knox.edu/offices/campus-safety/about-the-department/safety-and-education-programs  target= _hplink >high-quality brass</a>.  If you blew yours before your rape, and no one came to your aid, perhaps it was because of your whistle's poor metallurgy. Request a high-quality brass whistle right away. <br /> <br /> Reminder: Be sure to also ask whether you will be subject to  disciplinary action  for blowing the whistle outside of a narrow band of what your school's administrators perceive to be  threats.  After all, you don't want to get in trouble for violating a whistle policy. As a rape victim, you already have enough to deal with (like victim-blaming, slut-shaming, and terrible hearing procedures).<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Replenish Yourself After Being  Used Up </strong><br /> <br /> Feeling  used up  after being raped? Apparently using up women is totally normal--normal enough to talk about during a male university president's <a href= https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/11/10/debate-over-university-presidents-comments-rape  target= _hplink >convocation speech to female students</a>.<br /> <br /> So, after being used up, it's time to replenish! You have two ways to go here: there's wine, and then there's ice cream. Both work. We recommend having an ample supply of each on hand for post-rape emergencies. <br /> <br /> For example, you might get an email from your school telling you how much they  care,  but there's nothing they can do about your rape. Therefore, you will have to see your rapist on campus every day for the <a href= http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/09/emma-sulkowicz-campus-sexual-assault-activism.html  target= _hplink >rest of your college career</a>. A container of chocolate chip cookie dough or mint chocolate chip is usually the best way to replenish after seeing one's attacker, whereas Belgian chocolate tends to be a better choice in <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/11/unc-sexual-assault-report-false-charges_n_3049031.html  target= _hplink >cases of retaliation</a>.<br /> <br /> Pro-tip: Avoid the Cabernet on the day of your rape-reporting, as it's best not to be tipsy when you report your rape. Your listeners already tend to not believe you, since, you know, <a href= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/06/why_cops_don_t_believe_rape_victims_and_how_brain_science_can_solve_the.html  target= _hplink >hardly anyone believes rape victims</a>. Plus, school administrators love to <a href= http://www.buzzfeed.com/franciswhittaker/college-president-blames-sex-assaults-on-too-much-alcohol-an  target= _hplink >blame rapes on alcohol</a>--instead of on rapists--so don't give them any extra chances to do so. Dulling the pain with a little vintage should be saved for after the meeting. <br /> <br /> Of course, we sincerely hope that you never need to use our list of helpful tips. But if you do find yourself needing to report a sexual assault some day, perhaps the list will come in handy--at least as handy as all of the terrible how-to-not-get-raped advice that we've all been given lately.<br /> <br /> <em>Co-Authored by Annie E.

But that one stroke of the pen doesn't match up with the rest of his actions. </p><br /> <br /> <p>The ethos of this administration has been to <a href= http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/01/obama-leaves-do/  target= _blank  >look forward and not backwards</a>.

Obama may not want to dwell on the past, but history will, and his legacy on torture will be one of acceptance.</p><br /> <br /> <iframe class= js-hplive-frame   width= 570  height= 381  frameborder= 0  ></iframe><script type= text/javascript >(function(){var src_url= http://embed.live.huffingtonpost.com/HPLEmbedPlayer/?segmentId=548b40012b8c2a0fd80001e4&sid=577&showPlaylist=true&autoPlay=false&amp;onVideoDataLoaded=HPTrack.Vid.DL&amp;onTimeUpdate=HPTrack.Vid.TC ;if (typeof(commercial_video) ==  object ) {src_url +=  &amp;siteSection= +commercial_video.site_and_category;if (commercial_video.package) {src_url +=  &amp;sponsorship= +commercial_video.package;}}var iframe = document.querySelector( .js-hplive-frame );iframe.src = src_url;iframe.className=  ;})();</script>  "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 16:23:40 -0500"	"media"
"Obama Opts For ESPN Over Cable News In The Morning"	"President Barack Obama does not start his mornings off by devouring the latest political headlines from CNN, Fox News or MSNBC. No, the president gets enough of that during the day. Instead, like so many American's seeking solace from reports of war, disease and government gridlock, Obama turns to ESPN.  <br /> <br /> On Friday, during an interview with Colin Cowherd on ESPN Radio's  The Herd,  the president -- between plugging the Affordable Care Act and mentioning the importance of professional athletes speaking out on critical issues -- made sure he let listeners know just how much he loves watching sports. <br /> <br /> “I spend most of my time watching ESPN in the morning,” Obama said, adding that he watches  Sports Center  while working out. “I get so much politics I don’t want to be inundated with a bunch of chatter about politics during the day.”<br /> <br /> In October, former White House press secretary <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/27/jay-carney-obama-cable-news-printed-word_n_6054190.html  target= _hplink >Jay Carney divulged</a> that Obama doesn't bother watching the big cable news channels, but he somehow failed to mention that  Sports Center  makes up the majority of the president's morning news diet.

"The Bogus Defense of 'Enhanced Interrogations'"	"Despite irrefutable evidence in the Senate Intelligence Committee report that the CIA engaged in grotesque acts of torture in the years after 9/11, a group of former CIA directors and officials have taken to the airwaves to claim these actions were justified as a legally authorized program of  enhanced interrogations.   <br /> <br /> Whatever the intentions of the beltway creators of this program, we now know that, right from the beginning, the program used illegal forms of torture.<br /> <br /> The country would be well served if the CIA and its defenders would acknowledge this truth, apologize for what happened, and support laws to ensure it does not happen again. Continued advocacy for the discredited concept of  enhanced interrogations  is only compounding the damage to the United States that has resulted from this program and the decade-long controversy about it.<br /> <br /> From the beginning, the concept of  enhanced interrogations  was based on the flawed view that it is possible to distinguish between legal and illegal uses of violence during interrogations.  Virtually everything we know about human psychology and the nature of bureaucracies provided ample warning that once violence was introduced into the process -- the interrogations would devolve to torture.   <br /> <br /> And that is what occurred.  <br /> <br /> For example, the CIA assured the Justice Department that  enhanced interrogations  would begin initially using the least coercive forms of violence and psychological distress techniques.  But in the field, this guideline was immediately disregarded. Interrogators quickly escalated right up to the harsh techniques of sleep deprivation, requiring detainees to stand in place for hours, and the  confinement  box.  <br /> <br /> Promised limitations on the  enhanced  methods were also exceeded.  If one simulated drowning would not cause  prolonged mental harm,  the interrogators reasoned, then how could 2, or 10 or 183 (the number of times Khalid Sheik Mohammed faced this practice)? If it was okay to place a detainee in a box with insects (a practice the Justice Department authorized), then why would it be impermissible to engage in  rectal feeding  (a medically unnecessary practice the Senate report says was used on detainees).  <br /> <br /> The original sin, therefore, was to authorize the use of violence and intentional infliction of mental distress in the first place. The entire list of horribles in the Senate report followed from this initial lapse in judgment by the president and his top advisors.<br /> <br /> Nonetheless, the CIA's defenders continue to claim that the CIA acted appropriately because the program had been ordered by the president and certified as legal by the Department of Justice.  <br /> <br /> It is important to remember that the legal opinions authorizing the program were written by the White House's cherry-picked lawyer, John Yoo, who ignored all the venerable traditions of the Justice Department regarding vetting of its analysis with legal experts throughout the government.  Many civilian and military lawyers in the Department of Defense, with far more expertise than Yoo in matters relating to interrogation law, made clear that his legal opinions were flat out wrong. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a constitutional scholar to recognize that the memos were absurd on their face. Pages and pages of the analysis were comprised of a lawyer sitting at his desk in Washington attempting to determine whether the amount of physical and psychological pain resulting from an  enhanced interrogation  technique on a detainee, of unknown physical condition, in a cell 5,000 miles away, was  severe.   The perversion is even deeper when you consider that approval of the program by the Justice Department rested on assurances that doctors -- pledged by oath and law to heal the sick -- would be on site to regulate how much pain and psychological distress could be imposed on a detainee without causing  prolonged mental harm.    <br /> <br /> The fact that CIA personnel relied on the defective Justice Department memos is good reason to absolve individual interrogators of criminal liability. But it is not a justification for former CIA directors, officials, and agents to be defending the merits of the program. True, these were extraordinary times. But the program the CIA constructed and urged the president to approve was ethically and morally corrupted to its very core.   <br /> <br /> Instead of doubling down on the defense of this program, now would have been the time to admit mistakes and urge the country and the world to think about how the CIA can contribute to addressing the multiple, serious security challenges facing the world. The United States cannot lead the world if it condones the use of torture. It is unclear why the patriots who led the U.S. government and the CIA through the trauma of 9/11 and its immediate aftermath, fail to recognize this. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 14:52:32 -0500"	"media"

"'Both Sides' Are Wrong: Torture Did Work -- to Produce Lies for War (See Footnote 857 of Report)"	"<em>This post first appeared on the author's <a href= http://husseini.posthaven.com/what-both-sides-are-ignoring-torture-did-work-to-produce-war-see-footnote-857-of-report  target= _hplink >blog</a>. </em><br /> <br /> Nothing solidifies the establishment more than a seemingly raging debate between two wings of it in which they are both wrong. Not only wrong, but in their wrongness, helping to cover their joint iniquities, all the while engaging in simultaneous embrace and fingerpointing to convey the illusion of debate and choice.<br /> <br /> Such is the case with the  debate  on whether torture  worked  following the release of the Select Committee on Intelligence report on the CIA's  Detention and Interrogation Program.  <br /> <br /> On the one side, we have among others Dianne Feinstein:  The big finding is that torture doesn't work and shouldn't be employed by our country  <a href= http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/torture-doesnt-work-big-takeaway-cia-report-sen-feinstein  >she told PBS</a>. Similarly, a headline in the <i>Hill</i> tells us:  <a href= http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/226476-mccain-i-know-from-personal-experience-torture-doesnt-work  >McCain: 'I know from personal experience' torture doesn't work</a>. <br /> <br /> Then, we have six former directors and deputy directors of the CIA <a href= http://www.wsj.com/articles/cia-interrogations-saved-lives-1418142644  >claiming</a> the  interrogation program   saved thousands of lives  by helping to capture al-Qaeda members. On this score, the Intelligence Committee report seems to have the goods, quoting CIA emails. While the former CIA directors claim a string successes based on torture:  KSM [Khalid Sheik Muhammed] then led us to Riduan Isamuddin, aka Hambali, East Asia's chief al Qaeda ally and the perpetrator of the 2002 Bali bombing in Indonesia -- in which more than 200 people perished.  But the report quotes CIA officials internal emails:  <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/10/us-senate-rejects-cia-claims-torture-key-capture-bali-bombings-suspect  >Frankly, we stumbled onto Hambali</a>. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean Feinstein and McCain are right and that's the end of story. The truth is that torture did work, but not the way its defenders claim. It worked to produce justifications for policies the establishment wanted, like the Iraq war. This is actually tacitly acknowledged in the report -- or one should say, it's buried in it. <a href= https://twitter.com/samhusseini/status/542435002420432898  >Footnote 857</a> of the report is about Ibn Shaykh al-Libi, who was captured in Afghanistan shortly after the U.S. invasion and was interrogated by the FBI. He told them all he knew, but then the CIA rendered him to the brutal Mubarak regime in Egypt, in effect outsourcing their torture. From the footnote: <br /> <br />  Ibn Shaykh al-Libi reported while in [censored: 'Egyptian'] custody that Iraq was supporting al-Qa'ida and providing assistance with chemical and biological weapons. Some of this information was cited by Secretary Powell in his speech at the United Nations, and was used as a justification for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Ibn Shaykh al-Libi recanted the claim after he was rendered to CIA custody on February [censored], 2003, claiming that he had been tortured by the [censored, likely 'Egyptians'], and only told them what he assessed they wanted to hear. For more more details, see Volume III.  Of course, Volume III has not been made public.<br /> <br /> So, while CIA head John Brennan now says it's  unknowable  if torture led to information that actually saved lives, it's provable that torture led to information that helped lead to war and destroyed lives. <br /> <br /> Nor was al-Libi the only one tortured to try to make the case for war. Many have reported that CIA interrogators waterboarded two alleged top al Qaeda detainees <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/20detain.html  target= _hplink >repeatedly</a> -- Abu Zubaydah at least 83 times and Khalid Sheik Muhammed 183 times -- but few give the exact timing and context: They were so tortured in August 2002 and March 2003 respectively -- the beginning and end of the Bush administration's push for the invasion of Iraq.<br /> <br /> This was somewhat acknowledged in the other Senate report on torture, released by the Armed Services Committee in 2008. It <a href= http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/04/21/66622_report-abusive-tactics-used-to.html?rh=1  target= _hplink >quoted</a> Maj. Paul Burney, who worked as a psychiatrist at Guantanamo Bay prison:  A large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq and we were not successful. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish that link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.  The GTMO Interrogation Control Element Chief, David Becker told the Armed Services Committee he was urged to use more aggressive techniques, being <a href= http://documents.nytimes.com/report-by-the-senate-armed-services-committee-on-detainee-treatment#p=72  target= _hplink >told at one point</a>  the office of Deputy Secretary of Defense [Paul] Wolfowitz had called to express concerns about the insufficient intelligence production at GTMO. <br /> <br /> McClatchy <a href= http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/04/21/66622_report-abusive-tactics-used-to.html?rh=1#storylink=cpy  target= _hplink >reported</a> Sen. Carl Levin, the chair of the Armed Services Committee, said at that time:  I think it's obvious that the administration was scrambling then to try to find a connection, a link (between al Qaida and Iraq) ... They made out links where they didn't exist.  But now, Levin seems more muted, saying, in <a href= http://www.levin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/levin-floor-statement-on-intelligence-committees-report-on-cia-detention-and-interrogation#sthash.uVo6LEZy.dpuf  target= _hplink >response to the release of the recent report</a>, that false information leads to  time-consuming wild goose chases  -- which is quite an understatement given the human horrors that have resulted from the invasion of Iraq.<br /> <br /> So, contrary to the claim that torture helped save lives, torture helped build the case of lies for war that took thousands of U.S. lives and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives, helping to plunge the region into astounding violence, bringing al-Qaeda into Iraq, leading to the rise of ISIS and further bloody wars. As Arianna Huffington <a href= https://twitter.com/ariannahuff/status/542768791642722304  >noted</a>:  A perfect circle: Torture helps start Iraq War, which in turn gives us more people to torture. <a href= https://twitter.com/search?q=%23happyhumanrightsday&amp;src=hash  target= _blank  >#happyhumanrightsday</a> <br /> <br /> This oversight perhaps shouldn't come as too big a shock given who's calling the shots in Washington: Feinstein and McCain both voted for the Iraq war authorization in 2002, as did virtually everyone running foreign policy atop the Obama administration: VP Joe Biden, Pentagon heads Robert Gates and Chuck Hagel and Secs. of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.<br /> <br /> Some have made an issue of videos of torture being destroyed -- but it's been widely assumed that they were destroyed simply because of the potentially graphic nature of the abuse. But there's another distinct possibility: They were destroyed because of the questions they document being asked. Do the torturers ask:  Is there another terrorist attack?  Or do they compel:  Tell us that Iraq and Al-Qaeda are working together. ? The video evidence to answer that question has apparently been destroyed -- with barely anyone raising the possibility of that being the reason. <br /> <br /> Exploiting false information has been well understood within the government. Here's a 2002 memo from the military's Joint Personnel Recovery Agency to the Pentagon's top lawyer -- it debunks the  ticking time bomb  scenario and acknowledged how false information derived from torture can be useful: <br /> <br /> <blockquote>The requirement to obtain information from an uncooperative source as quickly as possible -- in time to prevent, for example, an impending terrorist attack that could result in loss of life -- has been forwarded as a compelling argument for the use of torture ... The error inherent in this line of thinking is the assumption that, through torture, the interrogator can extract reliable and accurate intelligence. History and a consideration of human behavior would appear to refute this assumption. </blockquote><br /> The document concludes: <blockquote>The application of extreme physical and/or psychological duress (torture) has some serious operational deficits, most notably, the potential to result in unreliable information. This is not to say that the manipulation of the subject's environment in an effort to dislocate their expectations and induce emotional responses is not effective. On the contrary, systematic manipulation of the subject's environment is likely to result in a subject that can be exploited for intelligence information and other national strategic concerns. [<a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/pdf/JPRA-Memo_042409.pdf  >PDF</a>]</blockquote><br /> <br /> So torture can result in the subject being  exploited  for various propaganda and strategic concerns. This memo should be well known but isn't, largely because the two reporters for the <i>Washington Post</i>, Peter Finn and Joby Warrick, <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/24/AR2009042403171.html?hpid=topnews&amp;sid=ST2009042403231  >who wrote about it</a> in 2009  <a href= http://firedoglake.com/2009/04/26/washington-post-helps-jpra-cover-up-complicity-in-torture-program  >managed to avoid the most crucial part of it</a> in their story, as <a href= http://www.truth-out.org/author/itemlist/user/44741  >Jeff Kaye</a>, a psychologist active in the anti-torture movement, has noted. <br /> <br /> One reporter who has highlighted critical issues along these lines is Marcy Wheeler -- noting as the recent report was being released:  <a href= https://www.emptywheel.net/2014/12/08/the-debate-about-torture-were-not-having-exploitation  >The Debate about Torture We're Not Having: Exploitation</a>,  where she writes:  Some other things exploitation is used for -- indeed the very things the torture we reverse-engineered for our own torture program was used for -- are to help recruit double agents and to produce propaganda.  Her reporting also raises questions about how torture was used to push a whole host of policies, which would make us a virtual tortureocracy: CIA director  John Brennan has admitted to using information from the torture program in declarations he wrote for the FISA Court. This means that information derived from torture was used to scare [FISA judge] Colleen Kollar-Kotelly <a href= https://www.emptywheel.net/2014/12/08/some-torture-facts  >into approving the Internet dragnet in 2004</a>.  (Disclosure: Wheeler writes a column for <a href= http://exposefacts.org/  >ExposeFacts.org</a>, a project of the Institute for Public Accuracy, where I work.) <br /> <br /> Many presumed critics of torture have, either intentionally or not, obscured its connection to war making and other agendas. Teju Cole notes in an interview with the <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/12/10/reading-the-times-with-teju-cole/?_r=0  ><i>New York Times</i></a> on Dec. 10 about that outlet:  The paper's fabrications and support for the Iraq war is a generational shame that shouldn't be too quickly forgotten. It should haunt us for a long time.  But his comments on the torture report betray a total lack of understanding of the connection between torture and the invasion of Iraq, ascribing to it the very human emotions of revenge rather than the more Machiavellian realities of policy making:<blockquote> Let's acknowledge torture for what it is: It is punishment, vengeance. It's the kind of havoc you wreak on an enemy or bystander merely because your rage needs an outlet. It has vanishingly little to do with intelligence-gathering. It spreads grief, and though it intends to do so, it spreads even much more than it intends. It destroys the perpetrators too. Rage is not a precision weapon.</blockquote><br /> <br /> But the rage of the general public -- steered in large measure by major media -- might have been useful in increased public acceptance of torture in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, but that's not what makes decisions in the U.S. It's decided by the machinations of a narrow set of elites who act in their interests as the utility of torture shows. The coverups for how war was made have grown so complex that critics like Teju Cole have been sucked into it.<br /> <br /> Researchers for Human Rights Watch <a href= http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/05/11/libyaus-investigate-death-former-cia-prisoner  >have done some good work in getting information on the al-Libi case</a>, but Ken Roth, the head of the group doesn't seem to take to heart the lessons of that case, writing that the CIA  <a href= https://twitter.com/KenRoth/status/542731263472594944  >forgot its own conclusions from 1989: inhumane interrogation was 'counterproductive,' yielded false answers'</a> in reference to a recent <i>New York Times</i> piece:  <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/world/senate-torture-report-shows-cia-infighting-over-interrogation-program.html?contentCollection=world&amp;action=click&amp;module=NextInCollection&amp;region=Footer&amp;pgtype=article  >Report Portrays a Broken C.I.A. Devoted to a Failed Approach</a>.  But it's not that the CIA  forgot -- the torture regime is actually designed to produce false but useful information that can be used to justify hideous polices. Pretending it's a  failed approach  is to exactly avoid telling the truth about the torture program just as everyone is claiming that they are telling the truth about it. <br /> <br /> And there are arguably other utilities of torture for war makers, often portrayed only as costs to the society as a whole: It's profitable to a few. It helps stifle dissent as a method of social control. It was likely especially effective at silencing the Arab and Muslim American community just as the U.S. was gearing up to invade Afghanistan and Iraq. <br /> <br /> The recent report highlights a CIA memo that relayed instructions from the White House to apparently hide the program from then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. Powell could  blow his stack if he were to be briefed on what's going on,  <a href= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/cia-torture-report-set-release-article-1.2038874  >the email said</a>. But when I questioned Powell on the connection between torture and war, he was remarkably defensive. His former chief of staff, Larry Wilkerson wrote in 2009 that the Bush administration's  principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. <a href= https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwashingtonnote.com%2Fthe_truth_about%2F&amp;ei=jg2LVIzvM9CCgwSd1oK4Bg&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-c7s0El8Y0e0K-QvSh1GqEcj5QQ&amp;sig2=51VNihN6wFPf2tkaWNxfQg&amp;bvm=bv.81828268,d.eXY  >but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al-Qaeda</a>.  Shortly after he wrote that, I questioned Colin Powell at the  media stakeout  as he left the CBS studios in DC:<br /> <br /> <blockquote >Sam Husseini: General, can you talk about the al-Libi case and the link between torture and the production of tortured evidence for war?<br /><br /> Colin Powell: I don't have any details on the al-Libi case.<br /><br /> SH: Can you tell us when you learned that some of the evidence that you used in front of the UN was based on torture? When did you learn that?<br /><br /> CP: I don't know that. I don't know what information you're referring to. So I can't answer.<br /><br /> SH: Your chief of staff, Wilkerson, has written about this.<br /><br /> CP: So what? [inaudible]<br /><br /> SH: So you'd think you'd know about it.<br /><br /> CP: The information I presented to the UN was vetted by the CIA. Every word came from the CIA and they stood behind all that information. I don't know that any of them believe that torture was involved. I don't know that in fact. A lot of speculation, particularly by people who never attended any of these meetings, but I'm not aware of it.</blockquote><br /> <br /> But my questioning was based on statements by Wilkerson, who was in the room. Presumably Powell has been waiting for the CIA to call him and tell him directly that torture was used to extract some of the information he used. See my piece  <a href= http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/02/06/how-colin-powell-showed-that-torture-works  >How Colin Powell Showed That Torture Works</a>  and <a href= http://blip.tv/grittv/grittv-washington-stakeout-colin-powell-2173969  >video</a>. <br /> <br /> This problem of torture yielding useful but false information was not unforeseeable. Professor As'ad AbuKhalil appeared on a news release for the Institute for Public Accuracy, where I work, the day after Powell's notorious UN speech:  The Arab media is reporting that the Zakawi story was provided by Jordanian intelligence, which has a <a href= http://www.accuracy.org/release/557-some-analysis-of-powells-speech/  >record of torture and inaccuracy</a>.  Indeed, the utility of torture might also help further explain U.S. government ties to brutal regimes. Part of what the U.S. government derives from them is capacity to torture and kill. As professor Lisa Hajjar has noted, it was the Egyptian  <a href= http://www.accuracy.org/release/egypts-torturer-in-chief-running-for-president/  >Torturer in Chief</a>  Omar Suleiman who got al-Libi to talk about a connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda -- the U.S. torturers in Gitmo had apparently failed. Bob Woodward <a href= http://www.claremont.org/article/strategically-challenged/#.VInDPXW98tM  target= _hplink >quotes</a> former CIA head George Tenet:  We created the Jordanian intelligence service and now we own it.  <br /> <br /> Of course such regimes sometimes fall in an out of favor, there can be little honor among thieves. Al-Libi himself was eventually turned over to Muammar Gaddafi, at a time when -- to the bewilderment of many -- the U.S. government was rather cordial with the former Libyan dictator. In 2009, a newspaper run by one of Gaddafi's son's claimed al-Libi committed suicide in his Libyan jail cell. Juan Cole wrote at the time:  The best refutation of Dick Cheney's insistence that torture was necessary and useful in dealing with threats from al-Qaeda <a href= http://www.juancole.com/2009/05/al-libi-case-eloquent-testimony-against.html  >just died in a Libyan prison</a>.  <br /> <br /> But only if we insist on forgetting this case and the evidence that lies for war and torture are joined at the hip.<br /> <br /> <center>__________________</center><br /> <i>Sam Husseini is communications director for the <a href= http://www.accuracy.org/  >Institute for Public Accuracy</a>.

"Your Money or Your Life"	"There is a Jack Benny routine where a mugger pointed a gun at Jack and said,  Your money or your life.  Jack hesitates. The mugger said,  Look bud, I said your money or your life.  Jack turns to the mugger and said,  I'm thinking it over. <br /> <br /> This scenario is very funny because it is so ridiculous. We all understand our lives are far more important than our money. Yet, when we consider our legacy to our children, grandchildren and the world, our focus often shifts away from our lives, our values and how we make a positive difference in the world to a discussion about passing our money onto future generations.<br /> <br /> Our legacy is not about our money; it is about the lasting impact we make on the people we love and the world around us. Ernest Becker said it best:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>What man really fears is not so much extinction, but extinction with insignificance. Man wants to know that his life has somehow counted... that it has left a trace, a trace that has meaning. And in order for anything once alive to have meaning, its effects must remain alive in eternity in some way.</blockquote><br /> <br /> We want to leave behind a trace that has meaning. That doesn't mean that 150 years from now people will remember your name. The truth is they probably won't. Your great-great-grandparents probably died about 150 years ago. How many of their first names can you recall?<br /> <br /> You may not recall their names, but you may be living their legacy. My family has a long history of entrepreneurship. My father, uncles and grandfathers were all entrepreneurs. I was told as a teenager that it is less risky to work for yourself than to work for someone else. I was told to take business risks while you are young; if it doesn't work out, you have plenty of time to try again. <br /> <br /> Their legacy inspired me to create my first entrepreneurial endeavor. I started my own window washing business in high school. When we were 34 and 31, my brother and I started GV financial advisors. Working together and with our colleagues, we have built a company that allows us to each use our signature talents while making a meaningful difference in the lives of our clients and colleagues.<br /> <br /> My children are 26 and 24. I don't know if either of them will be entrepreneurs. I do hope I have shown them the benefits of taking some risks while you are young, and of building a company that allows you to do what you love.<br /> <br /> Maybe more importantly, I want to leave my children a legacy of confidence and values. I want them to understand that they have the ability to overcome any adversity the future may hold. I want to share with them our family values of working hard, being kind, having a generous heart and contributing to the community. <br /> <br /> I hope that my children will pass on our family values to my grandchildren who hopefully will pass it on to my great-grandchildren. I don't expect my great-grandchildren to remember my name. I do hope they understand the value of being an entrepreneur and living by our family values.<br /> <br /> I want my legacy to include leaving the world a better place than I found it. My wife and I have always believed in the value of a quality education and in the power of community. We give our time, talents and money to a local charity that provides interest-free loans to kids struggling to pay for college. Our hope is the college experience will expose these kids to opportunities to meet new people, learn new ideas and pursue careers that will be both financially and personally rewarding.<br /> <br /> My wife and I don't expect these young adults to remember our names.

"New Changes May Make Getting a Mortgage Easier"	"If you've had past credit problems or can't save up enough to cover a large down payment, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may have just cut you a break when it comes to getting a mortgage.<br /> <br /> Stricter credit score limits, large down payments and even heavy paperwork requirements have kept many would-be borrowers from buying a home in recent years, but new rules put in place by the government-sponsored enterprises may change that.<br /> <br /> The new guidelines, which took effect this week, resulted from an agreement in October that clarifies when lenders would be penalized for making mistakes on mortgages they sell to Fannie and Freddie. Lenders have blamed the lack of clarity for tight credit conditions that have made it difficult for many consumers to qualify for a mortgage, <a href= http://online.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-lenders-set-to-relax-standards-1417197075  rel= nofollow ><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> reported.<br /> <br /> Here's what you need to know.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>Lower Credit Score Requirements</strong></b><br /> <br /> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a 620 credit score approval threshold for conventional loans, but many lenders had said they weren't sure what that limit was. By extension, they said they were hesitant to approve <a href= http://www.realtor.com/advice/can-spouses-credit-score-kill-mortgage/ target= _blank >consumers with subprime credit scores</a>, fearing those applications would be delayed or ultimately denied.<br /> <br /> Under the new rules, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have made their credit score and history requirements more transparent. As a result, lenders are likely to ease up on consumers who have lower credit scores or a black mark on their credit histories from a one-time events such as <a href= http://www.realtor.com/advice/help-lost-job-buying-a-home/ >job loss</a> or a big medical bill.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>Less Paperwork</strong></b><br /> <br /> In the past, many lenders imposed extra requirements--known as credit overlays--on consumers with past credit mistakes. For example, consumers with a past credit mishap would often have to write a letter explaining the mistake before the lender would approve their loan. This situation will definitely change, said Jason van den Brand, mortgage expert and CEO of online home refinancing service Lenda.<br /> <br />  The supplemental stuff that drives everyone nuts will decrease gradually,  van den Brand said.  Like being required to write a letter explaining why their credit was pulled for the loan they're applying for. Hello! It's [being] pulled because they are getting a home loan. That stupid stuff hopefully goes out the window and saves homeowners a bunch of headaches. <br /> <br /> Previously, if you had <a href= http://www.realtor.com/advice/6-smart-tips-securing-mortgage/  >late payments on your credit card or a small unpaid bill</a>, the lender might have been willing to approve you--but also required you to write and submit a letter of explanation for the mishap, adding more paperwork on your end.<br /> <br /> Under the new rules, many lenders may remove or lower the number of credit overlays they include, meaning less paperwork for you.<br /> <br /> <strong>A Possible Change in Processing Times</strong><br /> <br /> In recent years, getting a <a href= http://www.realtor.com/home-finance/get-mortgage-rates.aspx >mortgage</a> could take several weeks or two months. But will those new rules change that? <br /> <br />  Yes, but only slightly, and this is just a stepping stone,  van den Brand said.  You might see a day shaved off the process, but don't expect anything drastic. <br /> <br /> The application process will still be the most time-consuming factor for buyers. However, processing times might speed up if more lenders start going paperless.<br /> <br />  Once technology is enabled to allow folks to get their required documentation faster online, the whole process will really speed up,  he added.  Digital is the answer, and we're much closer to that than most people realize. <br /> <br /> <strong>More Changes in the Works</strong><br /> <br /> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may issue even more changes that benefit consumers in the future. According to <a href= http://www.forbes.com/sites/markgreene/2014/12/01/fannie-and-freddie-make-mortgaging-easier/ ><em>Forbes</em></a>, the enterprises are considering lowering the minimum down payment requirement from 5% to 3% for government-insured conventional loans.<br /> <br /> <strong>What This Means for the Future Market</strong><br /> <br /> The relaxing of credit scores could mean more people buying houses and a <a href= http://www.realtor.com/news/5-housing-market-predictions-2015/ >boost to the market.</a> A study from the Urban Institute published in March found that if credit requirements were relaxed to  normal levels,  about 1.2 million additional home loans per year could have been made.<br /> <br /> And while these new rules may help some buyers get that home, don't expect any overnight miracles for the housing market.<br /> <br />  It's not going to solve the perceived housing problem,  van den Brand noted.

"Best Cash-Back Websites for Earning Money on the Side"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-10-cash_back_websites.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-10-cash_back_websites.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-10-cash_back_websites-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <br /> <em>By Morgan Quinn, Feature Writer</em><br />  <br /> Online shoppers can go beyond coupons or price comparison tools to find the best money-saving deals. Cash-back websites are a popular way to earn back a portion of the money you already spend online. Consumers simply register with a cash-back website and start shopping, selecting from a list of the site's preferred merchants. Any time you buy something through the site, you receive a percentage of the sale in the form of cash back or other rewards. Many of these sites also offer rewards for referring family and friends, although they must make at least one purchase in order for you to reap the benefits.<br /> <br /> The savings these cash-back sites offer can vary, depending on which one you use, so it's important to compare the sites and shop through the ones that offer the highest payouts. The internet is littered with cash-back sites and it's difficult to know which ones offer the best rewards, so we've narrowed it down for you.<br /> <br /> In no particular order, here is a list of our favorite cash-back websites.<br /> <br /> <strong><em><a href= http://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/vote-personal-finance-expert-2014-here/  target= _hplink >>>Submit Your Vote for the Best Personal Finance Expert of 2014</a></em></strong><br /> <br /> <h3>1. ShopAtHome.com</h3><br /> <br /> ShopAtHome.com offers up to 70 percent percent cash back from an enormous selection of more than 3,000 online sellers, including Walmart, Bath & Body Works and Kohls. Once you rack up $20 in savings, the site mails you a check.<br /> <br />  ShopAtHome.com is all about saving our members money,  said Marc Braunstein, president and founder.  Not only do we boast more than 120,000 coupons from more than 50,000 stores, but we also offer cash back, exclusive deals and rewards that can be redeemed for free gift cards. <br /> <br /> <h3>2. Ebates.com</h3><br /> <br /> Ebates offers coupon codes for over 1,200 retailers, including Nordstrom and Sephora. Users can also earn up to 25 percent cash back on purchases -- and when you make your first purchase, the site will credit your account an additional $5. Checks are mailed quarterly once your account has reached a balance over $5, or you can request the rebate be donated to charity.<br /> <br />  Just like with almost every other online shopping center, we get a commission from the stores when you make a purchase. Instead of keeping that money -- like almost all other sites do -- we share it with you in the form of a 'Big Fat Check,'  said Mark Moran, senior vice president of marketing and distribution for Ebates.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Keep Reading: <a href= http://www.gobankingrates.com/credit-cards/10-rewards-credit-cards-2014/  target= _hplink >10 Best Rewards Credit Cards of 2014</a></strong></em><br /> <br /> <h3>3.

You can get cash back from hundreds of stores and thousands of store offers, as well as bonuses for referring friends and family members (they have to make at least one purchase). Earnings are paid any time via check or PayPal.<br /> <br />  Using a cash-back browser extension, like FatWallet Express, provides automatic notifications when you search or shop directly at your favorite stores. It's essentially the  easy button  for cash back,  said Brent Shelton at FatWallet.com.<br /> <br /> <h3>4. Swagbucks.com</h3><br /> <br /> Swagbucks.com offers cash-back rewards for more than just online shopping: Users earn a virtual currency called Swag Bucks for a variety of online activities, including searching, shopping, taking surveys, playing games and discovering online content. Members can simply install a search toolbar to make it easy to start earning rewards. Swag Bucks can be redeemed for retail gift cards, PayPal cash and other rewards.<br /> <br />  Cash back and rewards-based shopping is one of the easiest ways to save money while shopping online,  said David Weinrot, COO of Swagbucks.com.  Simply start your shopping at a rewards or cash-back site and receive a percentage of your purchase amount back in the form of cash or the site's rewards currency. We encourage shoppers to also 'stack deals' to get the most benefit, and it's quite simple. Find an online coupon code (we publish them on Swagbucks.com) that offers a dollar off or percent off. Plus, you can easily qualify for free shipping with a minimum purchase amount; and, if you pay with a rewards-based credit card, all of a sudden you will find yourself 'quadruple stacking' your rewards. <br /> <br /> <h3>5. Mypoints.com</h3><br /> <br /> Every time shoppers make a purchase through MyPoints.com they earn rewards points, which can be redeemed for for gift cards, cash back or even travel miles.<br /> <br /> <h3>6. Mrreebates.com</h3><br /> <br /> Mr. Rebates offers cash-back rebates of up to 30 percent on all your online shopping, plus coupons for over 2,000 merchants like Best Buy, Overstock.com and Dell.

Upromise.com</h3><br /> <br /> Upromise.com is a loyalty program where members earn credits on qualifying purchases. Members can shop from grocery stores, online retailers, travel sites, restaurants or gas stations to earn credits, which can be directed to a college savings plan or used to pay down student loans. Members can also request a check payout and are not required to spend their rewards on college-related expenses.<br /> <br /> <h3>8. Befrugal.com</h3><br /> <br /> BeFrugal.com features cash back, online coupons and promotion codes for over 4,000 merchants. The site also offer printable coupons that can be used offline at restaurants and grocery stores. If you make a purchase and then find a higher rate on another site, BeFrugal will apply the higher rate, plus 25 percent, to your rebate. You can cash out your rebates once your account has reached $25.<br /> <br />  You can use BeFrugal.com to find discounts and sales, earn cash back on your online purchases and maximize your shopping dollars,  said Jon Lal, the site's founder.  BeFrugal has coupons available for over 40,000 stores, including all of the top 500, and saves shoppers an average of $27 per order. <br /> <br /> <h3>9. ExtraBux.com</h3><br /> <br /> Find deals using the site's comparison-shopping tool, which allows you to select an item and then compare all the merchants selling that particular item.

You also get a $5 bonus just for signing up, as well as earn additional cash when your friends shop. Earnings are paid by check, Alipay or PayPal once your account has reached at least $10, or you can have the money donated to charity.<br /> <br /> <h3>10. BigCrumbs.com</h3><br /> <br /> BigCrumbs.com offers cash-back rewards for popular retailers like Beauty.com, Barnes & Noble and eBay. Become a BigCrumbs member and start earning cash back just by following the links to your favorite retailers. You can also earn more by referring friends and family to the site. Payouts are toward the end of each month, and you only need a balance of $1 to cash out.<br /> <br />  The smartest thing shoppers can do if they're searching for cash back on the Internet is to find a program they really like and stick with it!  said Vince Martin, CEO of BigCrumbs.com.  Most leading programs pay competitive rates, so small differences here and there tend to average out over time. That's why I'd say the biggest things to look out for when selecting a program are: 1. Reliable tracking, 2. Good customer service that stands behind members (especially when the occasional tracking glitch does occur), 3. Fast payments (for instance, some programs pay monthly vs. quarterly and some have higher minimum payment requirements before they'll send a payment).  "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 15:50:45 -0500"	"money"
"5 Cool and Easy Ways to Donate to Charity"	"One of the foundations of good finances is charitable giving. It might seem counterintuitive that <a href= http://personaldividends.com/reasons-to-give-to-charity/  target= _hplink >giving your money away results in better finances</a> for you, but it's true that giving can provide you with rewards that extend to the personal and the financial. <br /> <br /> From the warm fuzzies you feel when you donate to the <a href= http://www.taxdebthelp.com/blog/5-tips-taking-tax-deduction-charitable-donation  target= _hplink >tax deduction that you might receive</a>, it makes sense to be generous. If you want a few cool and easy ways to donate to charity, here are some ideas that can help you do more -- no matter how much money you have:<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Click to Donate</strong><br /> <br /> One of the coolest ways to support the charity of your choice is <a href= http://www.clicktodonate.org/  target= _hplink >Click to Donate</a>. There are a number of non-profits available for donation, and you can find what you're looking for quickly and easily. Not only that, but you can also download a browser plugin to help you find and donate as a part of your regular online activity. One of the things I like about Click to Donate is that it also helps you find local charities that you might not otherwise know about.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Amazon Smile<br /> </strong><br /> If you're like me, and you shop on Amazon a lot, you can put a portion of your purchases toward charity. <a href= http://smile.amazon.com/  target= _hplink >Amazon Smile</a> is a program that allows you to give, without changing any of your habits. It's true that the amount given is usually relatively small, so you don't want to make this your primary way of giving. However, if you want to do a little extra, using Amazon Smile can be a good choice.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Free Rice</strong><br /> <br /> This has long been one of my favorite ways to feed the hungry. Basically, <a href= http://freerice.com/#/english-vocabulary/1544  target= _hplink >Free Rice</a> is a quiz that donates food for each question that you get right. If you have a few minutes, you can answer questions and build up rice to be donated through the World Food Programme. I love it because you can help feed the hungry around the world, while at the same time learning something, since all of the questions have to do with word definitions. So, keep your brain sharp while helping others.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. Donate Credit Card Rewards</strong><br /> <br /> One of the coolest ways to donate to charity is to donate your credit cards rewards. If you have unused points or miles, you can usually <a href= http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/how-to-donate-unused-rewards-miles-points-1263.php  target= _hplink >donate them to charity</a>. Most credit card issuers allow you to do this, and some even have programs that will boost your gift. Check into the terms and conditions to see how you can make this donation. It's a good way to help others without breaking the bank.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Charity Miles</strong><br /> <br /> Want to get in shape while you donate to charity? A cool app called <a href= http://www.charitymiles.org/  target= _hplink >Charity Miles</a> will help you earn for charity when you walk, bike or run. All you have to do is follow your regular routine, and what you do will help others. You don't have to break the bank, and it can be a fun way to take your workout to the next level.<br /> <br /> <strong>Things to Remember When Giving to Charity</strong><br /> <br /> It's important to be smart about your charitable giving, however. Remember that many of these cool and easy ways to give (like Amazon Smile or Free Rice) aren't likely to amount to a huge donation. An occasional donation through these sites isn't the same thing as a regular donation of money or time, which is why Click to Donate, or a regular contribution to a charity of your choice (I make automatic monthly donations using my credit card), are more effective in the long run. I like to <a href= http://blog.equifax.com/family-money/prioritize-your-charitable-contributions-this-holiday-season/  target= _hplink >prioritize my main charitable donations</a>, and then use other means to do a little extra good.<br /> <br /> What are your favorite ways to give to charity?

"Obama Hails Budget Compromise, Citing Needed Ebola Funds"	"<br>(Adds quotes)</br>                <br>WASHINGTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  on Friday hailed a budget compromise that many of his fellow  Democrats opposed, saying it is a product of both sides working  together.</br>                <br> This is by definition a compromise bill,  Obama told  reporters as he met senior aides to discuss the U.S. fight  against the Ebola virus.  This is what's produced when you have  the divided government that the American people voted for. </br>                <br>In the negotiations, Obama found himself at odds with a key  Democratic loyalist in Congress, Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the  Democratic minority in the House of Representatives.</br>                <br>Pelosi wanted pulled out of the legislation a provision that  weakens some of the Wall Street reforms that Obama engineered  after the 2008-09 financial meltdown. While Obama opposed the  Wall Street reform provision as well, he did not actively fight  to get it excluded to avoid disrupting the compromise talks.</br>                <br> There are a couple provisions in this bill that I really do  not like,  Obama said. On the other hand, he said, it includes  funding needed for his signature healthcare law, fighting  climate change, expanding early childhood education and  confronting the Ebola virus.</br>                <br> Had I been able to draft my own legislation, get it passed  without any Republican votes, I suspect it would be slightly  different,  Obama said.  That is not the circumstance we find  ourselves in and I think what the American people very much are  looking for is responsible governance and the willingness to  compromise. </br>                <br>At his daily news briefing, White House spokesman Josh  Earnest sought to mend fences with Pelosi after the strains that  emerged between her and Obama on Thursday. He said none of the  central legislative achievements of the Obama presidency could  have been done without Pelosi's help.</br>                <br> The president is confident that the strong working  relationship and the effective, productive working relationship  that we have had over the last six years will continue for the  next two,  said Earnest, referring to the end of Obama's tenure.</br>                <br>Obama said the $1.01 trillion legislation that passed the  House of Representatives and appeared headed toward approval by  the Senate contains funds necessary for the fight against Ebola.</br>                <br> We've got to stay on this,  he said of the Ebola outbreak  in West Africa.  This is not a fight that is going to go away  any time soon.      (Reporting By Steve Holland)</br> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 14:22:00 -0500"	"money"

That is, the rise of finance was a money grab by the 1 percent.<br /> <br /> <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.salon.com/2014/11/30/how_to_deal_with_wall_street_and_income_inequality_in_one_fell_swoop/salonfinance2/  rel= attachment wp-att-13831854 ><img class= size-full wp-image-13831854 alignnone  title= SalonFinance2  src= http://media.salon.com/2014/11/SalonFinance2.jpg  alt=   width= 559  height= 334  /></a><br /> <br /> Because relatively few low-income and middle-income families own financial assets, they largely haven't benefited from the rise of finance. Instead, it's enriched the wealthy while saddling the middle class with debt.

HFT is a useless and distortionary practice that allows investors to make money off of millisecond-quick trades. (HFT recently attracted attention in Michael Lewis' book  Flash Boys. ) The practice <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/news/conferences/14fmc/Stiglitz.pdf >has been derided</a> by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz as a sophisticated version of front-running (buying a stock shortly before a pending order to take advantage of the price increase).<br /> <br /> The problem is that instead of channeling money toward profitable investment, HFT is a prime example of making money off of moving money around. A recent study <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/business/24trading.html?_r=3&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss >finds</a> that a one millisecond advantage can increase a firm's earnings by $100 million a year. Ironically, while bridges are <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/thousands-of-us-bridges-vulnerable-to-collapse/ >vulnerable to collapse</a> across the country and infrastructure in general is sorely undercapitalized, high-speed traders <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.wired.com/2012/08/ff_wallstreet_trading/all/ >spent</a> $2 billion on infrastructure in 2010 -- for high-speed cables to NYSE. HFT does nothing to benefit markets, but instead makes them more volatile.<strong> </strong><br /> <br /> <strong>The solution: A Financial Transaction Tax</strong><br /> <br /> When an industry has negative impacts on the broader public, economists call these effects  externalities.  It doesn't mean we should destroy the industry, but rather, limit the harmful behavior. In much the same way that we should tax carbon dioxide -- and do tax cigarettes and alcohol -- we should also tax financial transactions.<br /> <br /> The idea for a financial transaction tax has been around since John Maynard Keynes'  General Theory.<em>  </em>However, <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://ideas.repec.org/p/cwl/cwldpp/506.html >the idea began to gain traction</a> in the late '70s and '80s with the rapid growth of the financial sector. In 1989, Lawrence Summers and Victoria Summers <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://stevereads.com/papers_to_read/when_financial_markets_work_too_well.pdf >proposed</a> a U.S. Securities Transfer Excise Tax, arguing that it could raise some $10 billion annually. Recently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has<a style= color: #ff0000;  href= https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11185.pdf >supported</a> a financial transaction tax as well. A <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= https://ideas.repec.org/p/sus/susewp/1611.html >metastudy</a> by Neil McCulloch and Grazia Pacillo finds that a Tobin Tax (a type of FTT) would be  feasible and, if appropriately designed, could make a significant contribution to revenue without causing major distortions. <br /> <br /> From 1914 to 1966, the United States levied a 0.02 percent tax on sales and transfers of stock. Federally, Speaker Jim Wright pushed for a renewed tax in 1987, proposing a fee of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent on the buyer and seller of each securities transaction, highlighting the tax's progressive aspects. More recently, the  Wall Street Trading and Speculators Tax Act  was proposed by Sens. Harkin and DeFazio, which would assess a tax of 0.03 percent on trades of stocks, bonds, futures, options, swaps and credit-default swaps, and would <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://defazio.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/memo-joint-tax-committee-finds-harkin-defazio-wall-street-trading-and >generate $352 billion over 10 years</a>.<br /> <br /> Such a tax would not be unprecedented. On May 6, 2014, 10 European nations issued a<a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/business/international/european-financial-trading-tax-moves-forward-despite-new-pockets-of-resistance.html >joint statement</a> that a financial tax will begin in 2016 as a means to reduce speculation and raise revenue. The initial tax will focus on the trading of stocks and some derivatives, even though the initial proposal included taxing most financial products. The European Commission <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/com_2013_71_en.pdf >estimates</a> that a broad tax could raise $39 billion (31 billion EUR) in annual revenues.<br /> <br /> Further, there was a Stock Transfer Tax (a type of FTT) in place in New York from 1905 to 1981; revenue from the tax was split between the city and state (in the 1960s the full revenue reverted entirely to New York City). Because of a quirk in its phase-out, the STT remains technically legal in New York, though it is automatically rebated to the trader at a rate of 100 percent. Reducing <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.thenation.com/article/188505/why-cuomo-leaving-wall-street-cash-table >this rebate</a> would be a great way to boost revenues for New York and show the viability of a more expansive tax.<br /> <br /> Finance is an important part of any economy. But the unprecedented rise of finance has <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://theweek.com/article/index/258640/how-wall-street-is-crushing-main-street >harmed the real economy</a>, propelled inequality and <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://qz.com/196575/to-get-rich-forget-entrepreneurship-and-marry-wealthy/ >created opportunities for rent-seeking</a>. To rein in Wall Street and prevent another financial crisis, and to give governments much needed money to invest, we should levy a modest tax on financial transactions. Right now, the financial industry subsists on monetizing privilege. It needs to shrink so we can grow.<br /> <br /> This article originally appeared on <em><a href= http://www.salon.com/2014/11/30/how_to_deal_with_wall_street_and_income_inequality_in_one_fell_swoop/ >Salon</a>. </em><br /> <br /> </div> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 14:12:02 -0500"	"money"
"Government Goes After Student Loan Assistance Companies"	"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has taken action against some student loan assistance companies that are selling programs to consumers saying they can offer great benefits to those with student loans.<br /> <br /> The CFPB went so far as to say they  took action to put an end to two student  debt relief  scams that illegally tricked borrowers into paying upfront fees for federal loan benefits. <br /> <br /> The two companies in the crosshairs have passed over my keyboard before. Both <a href= https://getoutofdebt.org/tag/student-loan-processing >Student Loan Process.US</a> and <a href= https://getoutofdebt.org/50057/help-student-loan-default-review-are-they-a-scam >College Education Services</a> raised concerns for me early on and had been the target of other reports as well.<br /> <br /> Back in February of 2013 I wrote <a href= https://getoutofdebt.org/49243/student-loan-assistance-rescue-scams-on-the-rise-beware >this article</a> warning consumers about dubious student loan assistance outfits. The tea leaves were very clear on what was about to happen to consumers. It seemed the sales outfits that had been pushing debt settlement had moved on to now target those with student loans. It is/was almost like shooting fish in a barrel.<br /> <br /> And ironically, it was the very government loan servicers that were driving consumers into the hands of scammers by not knowing what programs were in their quivers or being properly incentivized to offer them.<br /> <br /> Rohit Chopra of the CFPB said,  We have previously noted that problems in student loan servicing can create the opportunity for scammers to flourish -- similar to the  foreclosure rescue  scams that grew in number as homeowners struggled with their mortgage servicers. <br /> <br /> And with the recent action against those two companies the CFPB says they are  issuing a consumer advisory today warning student loan borrowers to be wary of paying high fees for free federal loan benefits. <br /> <br />  Student loans are already a significant debt for many Americans. College Education Services and Student Loan Processing.US added to that hardship by taking advantage of troubled borrowers and failing to describe their services honestly,  said CFPB Director Richard Cordray.  When scam artists prey on student loan borrowers, we will take action to halt their illegal activity. <br /> <br /> <strong>College Education Services Banned from Industry</strong><br /> <br /> College Education Services, its owner, Marcia Elena Vargas, and advisor and employee, Frank Liz, marketed and advertised debt relief services to student loan borrowers with loans in default. Based in Tampa, Florida, the company advertised through Internet ads and operated websites including CollegeDefaultedStudentLoan.com and HelpStudentLoanDefault.com. The company reaped millions of dollars in advance fees from thousands of consumers before it ceased operations around February 2013. Specifically, College Education Services:<br /> <ul><br /> <li><strong>Charged illegal advance fees:</strong> Federal law requires at least one debt to be renegotiated, settled, or reduced before a fee can be collected for debt relief services. But College Education Services charged consumers between $195 and $2,500 and required all, or a substantial portion, of its fees to be paid upfront; the average fee was about $500. The company even took money from financially distressed consumers who could not qualify for loan consolidation, income-driven payment plans, or loan forgiveness programs.</li><br /> <li><strong>Falsely promised lower payments:</strong> Presenting themselves as  counselors,  College Education Services' telemarketers promised consumers that they could solve all the student loan issues that plagued consumers. Internet ads and telemarketers guaranteed lower monthly payments for consumers. One College Education Services' ad said,  Cut Your Student Loan Monthly Payment Up to 50% - Save Today!  The company often failed to deliver the promised results. For some consumers who qualified for loan consolidation, College Education Services selected monthly repayment plans that increased their monthly payments.</li><br /> <li><strong>Falsely claimed quick relief from default or garnishment:</strong> The company promised quick relief from default or garnishment. Garnishment is when a court order allows money to be taken from a consumer's salary, bank account, or other asset when she owes money. But the principal debt relief approach the company used - loan consolidation − did not and could not ensure those benefits in all cases, and not in the quick timeframe the company promised. - <a href= http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-to-end-student-debt-relief-scams/ >Source</a></li><br /> </ul><br /> <br /> College Education Services entered into a <a href= http://www.consumerfinance.gov/f/201412_cfpb_consent-order_the-college-education-services.pdf >consent order</a> with the CFPB. This agreement bans Vargas and Liz from  (1) offering, marketing, selling, or providing any Debt-Relief Service, whether directly or indirectly, (2) assisting any person offering, marketing, selling, or providing any Debt-Relief Service, including by consulting, brokering, planning, investing, or advising, and (3) receiving any monies or consideration from, holding any ownership interest in, providing services to, or working in any capacity for any person engaged in or assisting in the offering, marketing, selling, or providing of any Debt-Relief Service. <br /> <br /> The CFPB also took action against what I think was the larger player in this announcement, Student Loan Processing.US.<br /> <br /> <strong>Student Loan Processing.US Sued As Well</strong><br /> <br /> Student Loan Processing.US, a fictitious business name of Irvine Web Works, Inc., is headquartered in Laguna Nigel, California, with an office in Dallas, Texas. The CFPB alleges that since at least July 2011, the company and its owner, James Krause, has been marketing and advertising services to advise and assist borrowers applying for Department of Education federal student loan repayment programs. The company operates websites under the names StudentLoanProcessing.us, StudentLoanProcessing.org, and slpus.org. In the complaint filed today, the Bureau is accusing the company and Krause of:<br /> <br /> <ul><br /> <li><strong>Falsely representing an affiliation with the U.S. Department of Education:</strong> Claiming to be a  consultation service,  Student Loan Processing.US implies to consumers that it is affiliated with the Department of Education. The company uses a logo that resembles a government seal, stamps  Official Business  on its mail to consumers, and cites federal law prohibiting mail tampering to create the impression that the marketing material is sent or endorsed by the federal government.</li><br /> <li><strong>Charging illegal advance fees:</strong> Student Loan Processing.US charges consumers considerable upfront enrollment fees of either 1 percent of the consumer's federal student loan balance or $250, whichever is higher. The company requires payment of the entire fee before it even mails application materials to consumers.</li><br /> <li><strong>Deceiving borrowers about the costs and terms of its services:</strong> Student Loan Processing.US fails to clearly explain and disclose that it charges a monthly service fee that continues until the consumer's federal student loans are paid in full or discharged, a timeframe that could last decades. In certain cases, the company advises consumers who may qualify for zero payments to pay $39 a month - without adequately explaining that the $39 is going to Student Loan Processing.US as a fee.</li><br /> </ul><br /> <br /> The folks behind Student Loan Processing did not enter a consent order with the CFPB and are headed down the long road towards a trial.<br /> <br /> The <a href= https://getoutofdebt.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/201412_cfpb_complaint_student-loan-processing.pdf >complaint the CFPB filed</a> let's us know the CFPB alleges:<br /> <ul><br /> <li> Defendant James Krause is the founder, president, and sole owner of Student Loan Processing.US. Krause has substantial managerial responsibility for and daily control over the operations of Student Loan Processing.US, including sales, onboarding, training, communications, compliance, as well as Student Loan<br /> Processing.US's policies and procedures. </li><br /> <li> Consumers who contacted Defendants in response to an outbound call, the Defendants' mailer, or any other recruitment channel spoke with a self-proclaimed  Student Loan Specialist  for enrollment with Student Loan Processing.US.<br /> <br /> The enrollment calls typically began with staff at Student Loan Processing.US telling the consumer that they were  prequalified  for certain federal student loan repayment and forgiveness programs. During the call, the  specialists  directed the consumer to divulge their confidential 4-digit PIN information for the U.S. Department of Education's National Student Loan Data System, collected information about the borrower's federal student loan balances and annual income, and then quoted the new expected federal student loan monthly payment amount for borrowers who enroll.<br /> <br /> Defendants then gathered banking information from the borrower for payment of the enrollment fee, which was generally collected from the consumer's debit/credit card or bank account during the initial enrollment call. If a consumer needed to schedule payment of the enrollment fee or to break the enrollment fee into more than one payment, Defendants' employees were directed to ask the consumer about the frequency with which they were paid, as well as their next expected payday, in order to schedule the enrollment fee payment around that date. </li><br /> <br /> <li> Throughout the relevant time period, Defendants misrepresented to consumers, directly or by implication, that they were agents of the U.S. Department of Education or were affiliated with that agency in some capacity. </li><br /> <br /> <li> Until approximately September 2012, the logo for Student Loan Processing.US (image on the left below) shared several similarities with the U.S. Department of Education seal (image on the right below), including the outer spherical gold border, inner spherical gold border, tree  growing  from a base, and medium blue shading between the borders with white text. <br /> <br /> <img src= https://getoutofdebt.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Student-Loan-Processing-Logo.jpg  alt= Student Loan Processing Logo  width= 712  height= 294  class= aligncenter size-full wp-image-63215  /></li><br /> <br /> <li> For at least some consumers whose financial circumstances could potentially qualify them for a $0 monthly payment, Defendants regularly advised those consumers that Student Loan Processing.US could get that consumer's monthly payment amount  down to $39,  without separately explaining that the entire $39 payment would be paid to Defendants as a monthly fee, rather than payment toward the consumer's federal student loans. These types of statements, as well as those described in the preceding paragraphs, were made before a consumer consented to payment, as well as during the actual enrollment (when payment was made). </li></ul><br /> <br /> For more help with student loan issues, read <a href= https://getoutofdebt.org/51013/the-ultimate-guide-to-dealing-with-student-loans-you-cant-afford  target= _hplink ><strong>The Ultimate Guide to Dealing With Student Loans You Can't Afford</strong></a> and learn what you can do for yourself, for free.<br /> <br /> <img src= http://getoutofdebt.org/img/Steve-Sig.gif  width= 100  height= 46  title= Steve  Rhode - Consumer Debt Expert  alt= Steve  Rhode - Consumer Debt Expert  /></br><br /> Get Out of Debt Guy - <a href= http://twitter.com/GetOutOfDebtGuy  target= _hplink >Twitter</a>, <a href= https://plus.google.com/114824422459050954723?rel=author  target= _hplink >G+</a>, <a href= http://www.facebook.com/GetOutOfDebtGuy  target= _hplink >Facebook</a><br /> <br /> If you have a credit or debt question you'd like to ask, <a href= http://getoutofdebt.org/ask-the-hp-get-out-of-debt-guy  target= _hplink >just click here and ask away</a>.<br /> <br /> If you'd like to stay posted on all the latest get out of debt news and scam alerts, <a href= http://eepurl.com/doVqD  target= _hplink >subscribe to my free newsletter</a>.<br /> <br /> <link rel= canonical  href= http://getoutofdebt.org/63213/government-goes-student-loan-assistance-companies ><meta name= syndication-source  content= http://getoutofdebt.org/63213/government-goes-student-loan-assistance-companies > "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 11:35:49 -0500"	"money"
"Hurry Up! Big Obamacare Deadline Coming Monday"	"The first <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/14/obamacare-enrollment-2015_n_6155354.html  target= _hplink >Obamacare enrollment </a>deadline for next year is just three days away, meaning Monday is the last day for people in most states who buy their own health insurance to choose a plan they can begin using Jan. 1.<br /> <br /> If you're already a customer of a plan selected from a health insurance exchange marketplace or directly from an insurance provider, or if you're uninsured now and looking for coverage for the beginning of the year, there's no more time to waste. Here's are some don't's and do's that last-minute health insurance consumers should consider before the deadline in your home states.<br /> <br />  Don't wait until Sunday. Don't wait until Monday after work,  said DeAnn Friedholm, the health care reform campaign director at Consumers Union.  It is complicated. <br /> <br /> <strong>Don't delay!</strong><br /> <br /> If you're one of these people and don't visit <a href= https://www.healthcare.gov/  target= _hplink >HealthCare.gov</a> or your <a href= https://www.healthcare.gov/get-coverage/  target= _hplink >state's exchange</a>, you won't be able to get a new plan until February, and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/14/obamacare-enrollment-2015_n_6155354.html  target= _hplink >the last chance to choose a plan for any part of next year is Feb. 15</a> (<a href= https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/special-enrollment-period/  target= _hplink >except under special circumstances</a>). Five state's exchanges have different deadlines: Dec. 18 in <a href= https://www.marylandhealthconnection.gov/  target= _hplink >Maryland</a> and Dec. 23 in <a href= https://www.yourhealthidaho.org/  target= _hplink >Idaho</a>, <a href= https://www.mahealthconnector.org/  target= _hplink >Massachusetts</a>, <a href= http://www.healthsourceri.com/  target= _hplink >Rhode Island</a> and <a href= https://www.wahealthplanfinder.org/  target= _hplink >Washington state</a>. These deadlines only apply to people who buy health insurance through an exchange, a broker or directly from an insurer -- not those who get health benefits from their jobs or a government program like Medicare or Medicaid. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of factors to consider, like what doctors and hospitals you can access, what drugs and medical services are covered, how much you'll have to pay out of pocket when you get health care, and what the monthly premium is. Sorry -- there will be some math.<br /> <br /> To prepare, you should have some information and documentation handy, like your family members' Social Security numbers and last year's tax returns or something else to verify your income, which is how subsidies are calculated. <br /> <br /> <strong>Don't Stand Pat!</strong><br /> <br /> Maybe you got a really good deal on the health insurance you have now, and you like it, <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/upshot/why-most-people-wont-shop-again-for-health-insurance.html  target= _hplink >so you figure you're all set</a>. While it's true that the health insurance exchanges in most states (check with the exchange to find out about where you live) will automatically roll you into the same plan for next year if it's still available, there are a lot of good reasons shop around.<br /> <br />  Don't assume because you have something from last year that it's still the best value for you,  Friedholm said.  There are real savings here to be had for many, many people.  The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that <a href= http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2015/premiumReport/healthPremium2015.pdf  target= _hplink >more than 70 percent of current Obamacare enrollees could save money</a> next year by switching to a new plan with a similar level of coverage.<br /> <br /> Monthly premiums for exchange policies are <a href= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/health-industries/health-research-institute/aca-state-exchanges.jhtml  target= _hplink >going up and down all over the place</a> and<a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/23/obamacare-competition_n_5869710.html  target= _hplink > there are new plans on the marketplaces</a>. It's smart to check whether you can find something more affordable. <br /> <br /> Don't assume you don't qualify for financial assistance: 85 percent of this year's Obamacare enrollees did, and tax credits are available to people who earn up to four times the federal poverty level, or <a href= http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3190  target= _hplink >about $94,000 for a family of four</a>. <br />  <br /> For those who get subsidies, shopping is crucial because of the complicated way the tax credits are calculated. The value of the subsidy is linked to the cost of the so-called benchmark plan in every geographic area, and <a href= http://kff.org/health-reform/slide/change-in-benchmark-silver-premiums-2014-2015/  target= _hplink >those prices went down</a> in many places. These lower premiums mean smaller subsidies. Even if the sticker price for your current plan isn't going up much, you could end up paying much more by not finding a less expensive alternative because your tax credits will be worth less. (Read a more detailed explanation <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/13/obamacare-prices_n_6149076.html  target= _hplink >here</a>.) <br /> <br /> If you are automatically renewed into your existing plan and get a scary bill for January, you can switch to something else for the rest of the year, but you're stuck with that plan for at least a month (unless you cancel it outright and go without coverage).<br /> <br /> It's also vital to visit HealthCare.gov or a state exchange to update your household's income information. If you expect your income to rise and you and don't notify the exchange, you may have to pay back part of your subsidy.<br /> <br /> <strong>Do Your Research!</strong><br /> <br /> The plan you have now may have changed in ways other than price. Your doctor or hospital may not be in the network anymore, or may be available through a different plan. The amount you pay when you get health care may be different, as might the services the policy covers. The journalism nonprofit ProPublica created a useful tool that helps you compare benefits in this year's insurance plans with next year's. Find it <a href= http://projects.propublica.org/aca-enrollment/  target= _hplink >here</a>.<br /> <br /> The trickiest thing about choosing insurance is finding a balance between a decent monthly premium while not exposing yourself to out-of-pocket costs like <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/29/employee-health-benefits_n_5839022.html  target= _hplink >deductibles and copayments you can't afford</a>. For example, if you know you'll have frequent or big-ticket health care needs next year, it may make sense to pay a higher monthly premium so your out-of-pocket costs are lower, Friedholm said.<br /> <br /> <strong>Do Ask For Help!</strong><br /> <br /> To get information about the basics, like what health insurance jargon means or what factors you should consider when choosing a plan, try the <a href= https://www.healthlawhelper.org/  target= _hplink >Consumer Reports Health Law Helper</a>.

"Students Are Not Customers"	"The public schools have long been ideological battlegrounds. Ideologues are seldom content to grind their axes quietly and unobtrusively. If creationism were practiced only among consenting adults, then it might be worthy of the occasional snort or giggle, but for the most part it could just be ignored. However, creationists have tried many times to insert their tenets into the science curricula of public schools. I used to have a cartoon posted on my office door that showed a thick volume titled <em>Texas Science Textbook: King James Version. </em><br />  <br /> The courts have largely stymied the creationists, but the ideological armies march on. Here in Texas, where election to the State Board of Education turns more on purity of creed than academic qualifications, students get the Fox News version of social studies. Textbooks are required to tout  American Exceptionalism,  and the glories of the free market. Among the surprising  facts  that Texas students learn is that Mosaic law laid the basis for the American Constitution, that the Civil War was not chiefly about slavery (which might not have been so terribly bad after all), and that, by golly, ol' Joe McCarthy really did find some commies lurking in the federal government. <br />  <br /> Now the ideologues have set their sights on higher education. Their approach is much subtler here. They do not aim so much to impose a curriculum (though the Koch brothers have made a stab in this direction). Their aim is far more fundamental and insidious. Their goal is nothing less than the destruction of the ancient and venerable academic culture. <br /> <br /> The culture of academe is the product of a historical development that began with the founding of Plato's Academy 2400 years ago. This academic culture recognizes the essential role of research and the necessity of protecting the intellectual independence of researchers by the institution of tenure. Legitimate research cannot be accomplished if researchers are required to toe a doctrinal line or avoid offending the powers-that-be. As Socrates asserted long ago, researchers must be free to follow the argument wherever it leads, even if it leads to conclusions that politicians and administrators do not like.<br /> <br /> Academics further recognize that, far from being opposed, research and teaching are complementary. Research brings fresh ideas, new perspectives, and deeper insights, and the most effective teachers are those who enliven their instruction with the stimulus of fresh thinking. Conversely, though this is less often recognized, the skills developed by teaching are also helpful to researchers. Teaching students demands a rigorous clarity of thought that can communicate the essence of a concept without oversimplifying. Such clarity is a helpful correction to the academic occupational hazard of letting jargon substitute for thinking. <br /> <br /> Ideologues of the right, with increasing support from politicians, and even from some university administrators, now want to impose a  business model  on academe. On this model, students are customers, and universities are in the business of manufacturing degrees. If universities are businesses, then the main function of a professor is to generate income. To that end, professors should teach more and larger courses. They should teach few specialized courses for small groups of advanced students. Rather, they should mostly teach big courses and their salaries and promotions should turn largely on how many butts are in the seats in their classrooms. If professors are to teach more and larger classes, then, obviously, there will be less or no time for research. However, proponents of the business model disparage most academic research. Unless research generates grant money, it is to be discouraged. <br /> <br /> If professors don't like these changes, you get rid of them! In fact, this process is already well underway. Nationwide, full-time, i.e. tenured or tenure-track, professors are being replaced by adjuncts who receive low pay, no benefits, and have no job security. Conservatives have long despised academics because scholarly research refuses to line up behind right-wing hobby horses. For instance, academic research debunks right-wing views on evolution, climate change, supply-side economics,  reparative therapy  for gay people, and abstinence-only sex education. The real nemesis of conservative ideology is objective reality. As Jon Stewart puts it, the facts have a liberal bias. So, the academic researcher is disparaged and despised for dumping the cold water of reason onto the wishful thinking of conservatives. <br /> <br /> So, what is wrong with the  business model  for higher education? Business models are great -- for businesses. However, educating human beings is not like manufacturing and marketing widgets. For one thing, students are not customers. The customer is always right, but the student is not always right. The professor, like a medical doctor, has the responsibility of telling people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Further, unlike selling widgets, success in education simply cannot be quantified in terms of moving so many units in a given time. A degree is not a tangible thing; it is a symbol, a symbol of the attainment of a certain level of skill and knowledge. Viewing a degree as simply a marketed product makes the symbol more important than what it supposedly symbolizes. You are no longer educating. You are selling credentials. <br /> <br /> Real conservatism -- the conservatism of Edmund Burke, not the incoherent mess that now goes by that name -- can be summarized by the slogan  If it isn't broken, don't fix it.  Public higher education in our society is not yet broken, but it soon will be if the ideologues and the politicians keep  fixing  it their way. "	"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 22:52:53 -0500"	"money"
"5 Reasons Housing May Be Headed for Trouble"	"<p>The housing market has been on a roll recently, with some markets even recovering to their peak 2006 levels. That sounds good, until you remember what 2006 was like. In retrospect, it seems clear that those prices were overly inflated by a boom mentality. Can the same be said for the housing market now?</p><br /> <p>So far, home prices have been rising at a more measured pace than they were back in the frenzy of the housing boom. Still, there are at least five reasons to be cautious about the housing market.</p><br /> <p><strong>1. The Fed is no longer keeping mortgage rates down</strong></p><br /> <p>Quantitative easing is over. While the <a href= http://www.money-rates.com/fed.htm >Federal Reserve</a> is still keeping short-term interest rates near zero, it has discontinued the monthly bond purchases that were designed to push longer-term rates down. This was an important influence in getting <a href= http://www.money-rates.com/mortgage.htm >mortgage rates</a> to record lows.</p><br /> <p>So far, mortgage rates have been surprisingly stable, but without the Fed actively keeping them lower, there is no reason why normal market forces could not quickly send them higher -- especially if there is a whiff of inflation somewhere along the line.</p><br /> <p><strong>2. Prices have been rising for more than two years now</strong></p><br /> <p>According to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, the housing market bottomed out in February 2012 and has been rising ever since. The good news is that prices still are not as high as they were in 2006, nor has the rise been as steep. However, the closer prices get to those levels, the more you have to ask what would make them sustainable now if they were not sustainable then.</p><br /> <p><strong>3. Some loan limitations are being softened</strong></p><br /> <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency recently announced that it would allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to back mortgages with down payments as low as 3 percent.</p><br /> <p>After the epidemic of irresponsible lending that went on during the housing boom, the government tightened loan standards. Higher down payment requirements made sure borrowers were more fit to meet their obligations, and would not be as exposed to fluctuations in home prices. By facilitating more low-down payment loans, the government is backing away from these cautionary measures.</p><br /> <p><strong>4. A key banking safeguard has been eroded</strong></p><br /> <p>Separately, federal regulators also announced they were easing a requirement that banks had to keep at least a 5 percent stake in mortgage loans they made. Risk retention requirements made sure banks had an incentive to make responsible loans. By letting banks completely sell off the risk in the form of securities, banks can free themselves of any ongoing responsibility for the loans they make.</p><br /> <p><strong>5. Default rates are creeping back up</strong></p><br /> <p>Mortgage defaults have slowed considerably over the past five years, but most recently they have risen for three straight months. They are still low, and it is too early to tell whether this change is a temporary blip or a true turning point. However, this is a trend worth watching.</p><br /> <p>The best way you can protect yourself from a setback in the housing market is to base your purchase decisions on what your income can readily afford, and not on the assumption that prices will keep rising. After all, buying a home means putting a roof over your head, and that should not be a speculative investment.</p><br /> <p><strong>Also by Richard Barrington:</strong></p><br /> <ul><br /> <li><a href= http://www.money-rates.com/advancedstrategies/mortgage/when-to-bet-house-refinancing.htm >When it makes sense to bet the house</a></li><br /> <li><a href= http://www.money-rates.com/ask-the-expert/pay-down-mortgage-or-build-savings.htm >Pay down my mortgage or build savings?</a></li><br /> <li><a href= http://www.money-rates.com/research-center/interest-rate-forecast-2014.htm >Where will interest rates go in 2014?</a></li><br /> </ul> "	"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 19:57:00 -0500"	"money"
"Dow 18,000 Spooking You?"	"The Dow is within striking range of 18,000 and may hit it by the time I post this article.<br /> <br /> To be honest, it really doesn't mean a lot. Many investors get really spooked by these levels. I'm not sure why. If I had to guess why they get spooked, I'd say it's because they are reminders of previous <a href= http://www.thediligentadvisor.com/managing-risk/the-most-dangerous-time-in-the-stock-market/  target= _hplink >investing mistakes</a>.<br /> <br /> A market high does not indicate a looming correction, nor a market that will continue up like a rocket going into orbit. So there's the confusion as to what investors should do when we hit these new levels.<br /> <br /> <strong>So if your are spooked by Dow 18,000 here are some tips:</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Dollar-cost average.</strong><br /> If you have new money to invest, but are nervous about where the markets are right now, <a href= http://www.thediligentadvisor.com/investment-strategies/too-scared-to-invest/  target= _hplink >dollar-cost averaging</a> is your best friend. <strong>Whether you have a lump sum to invest or you are adding to your 401(k) at work, this is your first strategy to use at a market high.</strong> Dollar-cost averaging is a technique where equal amounts are invested over a set period of time. (example $1,000 for 10 months) By doing so, more shares are purchased when prices are low and fewer shares are purchased when prices are high. <em>Not to mention it will keep you from having a nice stroke if the market drops after you throw a large chunk in.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Ignore the herd.</strong><br /> It's human nature to join the crowd to not get left behind. When it comes to investing, follow your plan. Do what you need to do for your future and avoid the  hot tips . <strong>Don't listen to advice from your family, friends, co-workers or other well-intentioned financially challenged individuals in your life.</strong> If everyone else is doing it, maybe it's time for you to do the opposite? Be patient, but don't procrastinate either.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't be in a hurry to  get in on the hot investment.  </strong>Investing opportunities are like buses, if you missed the first another will be along in a few minutes. On the flip side of patience, is procrastination. Don't wait for the perfect time to invest. There isn't one. If you're that afraid, just pass. If you are just nervous, but want to invest, then invest using dollar-cost average. You may want to do this early to catch the best prices before the rally gets going even higher.<br /> <br /> <strong>Diversify globally.</strong><br /> Most American investors put the majority of their money domestic markets. That's dumb. America only accounts for about one fifth of the world's economy. By spreading it out among other markets, you'll potentially catch the next market rally somewhere else in the world. This could be a much better idea if you procrastinated and didn't enter the bull market early enough.<br /> <br /> <strong>Nobody can predict the weather or the direction of the market.</strong><br /> How many times have economists told you the wrong thing? Your local weather person is more accurate than these guys! I don't know how many of them said this market will correct substantially, it can't go this high, blah, blah, blah. Really? <strong>Ignore the predictions and stick to your overall plan.</strong><br /> <br /> It's easy to listen to friends or the media discussing gloom and doom. Every time we hit a new high these guys crawl out of the woodwork when the lights come on, like cockroaches in a dirty motel (maybe that was a little disgusting). No need to get spooked, just follow your plan, and if you are still worried I'll be happy to give you a second opinion.<br /> <br /> <em>If you liked my article, you can <a href= http://thediligentadvisor.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=45dc35dc784bdb1e211e6eedd&id=d6a2f55396  target= _hplink >subscribe here for free!</a> I'll have my overpaid virtual paperboy deliver it every Friday to your inbox.</em> "	"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 16:37:31 -0500"	"money"
"Money To-Dos for Your 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s"	"They say wisdom comes with age--but it's never too early (or late!) to start making smart money moves.<br /> <br /> How do we know?<br /> <br /> Well, after culling some of the most popular goals that our <a href= https://www.learnvest.com/personal-financial-planning-program/  target= _hplink >premium</a> LearnVest users are working toward, we found that the more things change, the more things stay the same. Our findings revealed that these folks place saving for retirement and building up a healthy emergency fund as among their top goals, no matter how old they are.<br /> <br /> But money goals can also reflect your life stage: We found that younger savers in their 20s and 30s are concentrating on big-picture to-dos that will help set them up for their futures, while people in their 40s and 50s are trying to get rid of that last bit of debt before they tap into their nest eggs.<br /> <br /> Curious to see where you stack up in the financial goals department?<br /> <br /> Check out our guide to the financial goals you should consider focusing on each decade, including nuggets of advice from a CFP® for how to work on achieving them.<br /> <br /> <strong>3 Financial Goals for Twentysomethings</strong><br /> <strong>1. Emergency Savings </strong><br /> Perhaps because they've seen firsthand what a recession looks like, our research found that building up an emergency fund is the biggest goal that people in their 20s had for themselves.<br /> <br /> The general rule of thumb is to work as much as possible toward saving six months' worth of take-home pay, says David Blaylock, CFP® with <a href= https://www.learnvest.com/personal-financial-planning-program/  target= _hplink >LearnVest Planning Services</a>. Of course this can seem daunting to recent college grads who are just starting to chip away at student loan debt. But the reality is that this decade can be a good time to gain traction on emergency savings because bigger costs, like a mortgage or child care, typically haven't kicked in yet.<br /> <br />  You have less income, but you don't have as much responsibility,  says Shelly-Ann Eweka, a CFP® with TIAA-CREF.  The key is to start.  And you can do this by reviewing your budget and pinpointing what percentage of your pay you can earmark for emergency savings--and then sock away that amount until you reach your six-month goal.<br /> <br /> And remember that emergency savings is just one of the three things that we believe make up your financial security--the other two include retirement and paying down credit card debt. So consider devoting about 20% of your take-home pay toward all three goals combined, if it works within your budget.<br /> <br /> RELATED: <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/are-you-financially-healthy-the-3-numbers-you-should-know/  target= _hplink >Are You Financially Healthy? The 3 Numbers You Should Know</a><br /> <br /> <strong>2. Saving for Retirement</strong><br /> If you've started setting money aside for retirement in your 20s, you're already making progress. If you haven't, the good news is that you've got time on your side--and a lot of it, at that--to take advantage of <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/compound-interest-101-how-it-works/  target= _hplink >compound growth</a>.<br /> <br /> As a general rule of thumb, aim to save at least 5% of your gross income, if possible, with the eventual goal of increasing it to 15 to 20%. And if your employer offers a 401(k) match, says Eweka, try to contribute enough to maximize the match. Think of it this way: That match amount is essentially bonus money to fund your future retirement.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Saving for a Home</strong><br /> Young folks today are such overachievers: Retirement and a down payment on a home were tied for the No. 2 most-saved-for goals among LearnVest users, which is great--as long as you're building up that aforementioned financial security first.<br /> <br />  In your 20s, you may have the appetite for owning a house, but there's a lot of uncertainty,  Blaylock says.  What if the dream job of a lifetime comes up in D.C. and you just bought a home in Boston?  What is pretty certain, however, is that you will eventually retire, so you should make sure you're putting enough toward your nest egg before you start stashing away for a down payment.<br /> <br /> That said, if you are making progress on retirement and want to save for a home in your 20s, your timeline is key to the type of saving strategy you might take. So, for example, if you know you won't be ready for a starter (or forever) home for at least five years, consider investing some money into a brokerage account so that your down payment savings can potentially grow even further.<br /> <br /> <strong>3 Financial Goals for Thirtysomethings</strong><br /> <strong>1. Emergency Savings</strong><br /> By the time you've hit the big 3-0, you've seen firsthand how life can throw unexpected curveballs--you may have already dealt with your first big car repair or emergency root canal.<br /> <br />  You probably have more responsibilities and less flexibility with your money than you had in your 20s, so your emergency fund is more important than it used to be,  Eweka says.  Plus, you might have someone else depending on your income. <br /> <br /> RELATED: <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/2013/08/the-3-times-i-used-my-emergency-fund-was-i-right-to-dip-into-it/  target= _hplink >The 3 Times I Used My Emergency Fund: Was I Right to Dip Into It?</a><br /> <br /> If you're in your 30s and haven't put a penny toward emergency savings, that should be goal No. 1, says Blaylock, starting with at least one month's worth of take-home pay, and then you can steadily work your way to a fund of six months' worth.<br /> <br /> If you need to find places in your budget to direct toward emergency savings, try to isolate areas of your budget where you may be able to lower or eliminate expenses--say, getting rid of premium cable or downgrading your cell phone plan--so you can redirect those savings toward your emergency fund.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Saving for Retirement</strong><br /> The next-in-line goal for thirtysomethings that we surveyed was building up their nest egg. This can be all the more important during this decade if you didn't start saving in your 20s because you've missed out on some compound growth.<br /> <br />  Think of it this way: $1 saved in your 20s may be worth $16 during retirement, whereas that same dollar saved in your 30s may only be worth $9 during retirement,  assuming a 7% rate of return, says Blaylock. So if you're just getting around to saving in your 30s, consider allocating at least 10% of your gross income toward retirement.<br /> <br /> And if you've started saving but are looking for ways to boost your contributions, consider increasing your IRA or 401(k) contributions by the same percentage as your salary hike the next time you get a raise. If you're able to stretch yourself, you can also set calendar reminders to raise your contributions by 1% every six months.<br /> <br /> RELATED: <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/americans-rev-up-their-retirement-contributions-123/  target= _hplink >Americans Rev Up Their Retirement Contributions</a><br /> <br /> <strong>3. Saving for a Home</strong><br /> By this decade, you may be married or living with a partner, and may even have a couple of kids in tow. You're also likely to be more stable in your career, so it makes sense that saving up for a home would be a top goal in your 30s.<br /> <br />  At this point, I think you can start balancing your need for a new home with saving for retirement  and other financial security goals, says Blaylock.<br /> <br /> But he offers a word of caution for those who are considering the first-time homeowner benefit, where you put as little as 3% down in exchange for a higher mortgage payment.<br /> <br />  A far better option is to make as significant a down payment as possible, with the ideal number being 20%,  Blaylock says.  With this strategy, you'll not only have a lower mortgage payment but you may be able to avoid costly mortgage insurance. <br /> <br /> RELATED: <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/2014/04/how-much-can-i-afford-for-a-home/  target= _hplink >4 Couples, 4 Home Purchases: How Much Can They Afford?</a><br /> <br /> <strong>3 Financial Goals for Fortysomethings</strong><br /> <strong>1. Saving for Retirement</strong><br /> At this point, you're just entering the Sandwich Generation years, which means you're likely juggling your kids' needs, your parents' needs and your needs all at the same time. Still, it's imperative to try to <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/2014/07/pay-yourself-first/  target= _hplink >pay yourself first</a>--which is why it's a good thing that retirement tops this decade's list.<br /> <br />  You can see retirement in the nearer future [in your 40s], and hopefully you've started maxing out your retirement contributions already,  Eweka says.  If you haven't, you need to be more aggressive with retirement savings. <br /> <br /> If you're only starting to save in your 40s, then consider putting at least 20% of your gross income toward your nest egg. And make sure you're taking full advantage of any company match, so you're not leaving any money on the table.<br /> <br /> If you need to play catch-up, you might also consider looking into opening more than one type of retirement account, such as a <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/which-is-right-for-you-traditional-ira-vs-roth-ira/  target= _hplink >Roth or Traditional IRA</a> in addition to your company's 401(k).<br /> <br /> And remember that, as much as you'd like your kids to have a hefty college account waiting for them on graduation day, don't save for them at the expense of your retirement. Bottom line: You can always borrow for your child's education, but you can't borrow for your golden years.<br /> <br /> RELATED: <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/2014/07/pay-yourself-first/  target= _hplink >Pay Yourself First: The Habit That Can Help You Build Wealth</a><br /> <br /> <strong>2. Saving for Emergencies</strong><br /> In your 40s you're probably at the height of your earning power, but don't think that you can let up on that six-month emergency savings goal. After all, the larger your family, the more likely you are to have an unexpected expense pop up--like the day your 10-year-old son broke his leg snowboarding.<br /> <br /> One thing that could potentially help pad that emergency fund? Bonuses or other <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/the-jackpot-problem-a-wise-guide-to-windfalls/  target= _hplink >windfalls, like tax refunds</a>.  Take advantage of those lump sums to fund your emergency savings goal,  Eweka says.<br /> <br /> Our 90/10 rule provides a good guideline to consider: Put 90% toward such financial priority goals as retirement, paying down credit cards or emergency savings. And use the remaining 10% for something fun--like a safer family vacation this time.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Paying Down Credit Card Debt</strong><br /> Apparently with age comes credit card debt, which isn't surprising considering you've likely got more groceries, back-to-school items and weekend activities to pay for than you did in your 20s and 30s.<br /> <br />  I don't find [credit card debt in your 40s] uncommon at all,  Blaylock says.  People might get through their 20s and 30s without credit card debt, but then they can get back into debt  because of their added financial responsibilities.<br /> <br /> Blaylock actually prefers that people exit their 30s with no credit card debt, if possible. But if you do have some, you should come up with a monthly payoff amount that can help you eliminate the debt in five years, so you can work on making progress on your other financial security goals.<br /> <br /> One more suggestion? Prioritize your credit card debt by tackling the one with the highest interest rate first, while still paying the minimums on the others, says Eweka.<br /> <br /> RELATED: <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/credit-score-change-123/  target= _hplink >Why Your Credit Score Could Suddenly Change on You</a><br /> <br /> <strong>3 Financial Goals for Fiftysomethings</strong><br /> <strong>1. Saving for Retirement</strong><br /> In your 50s you're likely fully settled in your career, and your children are either in college or on their own. Most impressively, you probably have more workdays under your belt than on the horizon.<br /> <br /> As such,  now is the time to really hammer in on retirement,  Blaylock says, adding that you should focus on ramping up retirement savings if you feel like you're behind. The good news is you can take advantage of catch-up contributions for your 401(k) and IRA, which let you <a href= http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Retirement-Topics-Catch-Up-Contributions  target= _hplink >put in an extra $5,500 and $1,000,</a> respectively, if you're age 50 or older.<br /> <br /> If your retirement account doesn't hold target-date funds, which rebalance automatically as you get closer to retirement age, then consider taking a look at your investments to figure out if you're comfortable with the risk level in your portfolio.<br /> <br /> You'll likely want to dial down the risk, Blaylock says, although it's a good idea to work with a financial adviser to help you figure out what adjustments should be made to help you reach your retirement goals.<br /> <br /> RELATED: <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/2014/01/saving-for-retirement-is-it-too-late/  target= _hplink >I Started Saving for Retirement--When It Was Almost Too Late</a><br /> <br /> <strong>2. Emergency Savings</strong><br /> Hindsight is twenty-twenty, and fiftysomethings have probably seen it all--which is why they may still see the value in keeping their emergency savings fully funded.<br /> <br />  Even when you're 50, the six-month rule applies,  Blaylock says.  You still want to work toward that goal. <br /> <br /> In fact, you might even consider building up your savings with more than six months of take-home pay--maybe even a year or two's worth--as long as you're already fully funding your retirement goals. This way you may not have to dip into your retirement funds early if a major financial emergency strikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Paying Down Credit Card Debt</strong><br /> When you're encumbered by credit card debt in your 20s, you probably have years to amend those youthful financial transgressions. But it's another story when you're nearing retirement.<br /> <br /> Ideally, you want to be as close to debt-free as possible when you're approaching life after work because you don't want your retirement plans waylaid by credit card balances.<br /> <br /> So consider taking a look at both your fixed and flexible expenses each month and determine where you can cut back--perhaps what you save by cutting back on an expensive gym membership can be put toward debt repayment.<br /> <br /> And, most important, try not to take on new debt. So that means no more borrowing to pay for your child's college tuition, or cosigning any other types of loans for your adult children.  You don't want to get into retirement with all this debt,  Eweka says.  You're [putting yourself at] risk of running out of assets if you're no longer working. <br /> <br /> RELATED: <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/2013/03/when-a-recent-grad-dies-who-should-pay-the-student-loan-debt/  target= _hplink >When a Recent Grad Dies, Who Should Pay the Student Loan Debt?</a><br /> <br /> <em>This post originally appeared on <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/financial-goals-guide-money-to-dos-for-your-20s-30s-40s-and-50s/  target= _hplink >LearnVest</a>.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>More From LearnVest</strong><br /> <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/2014/07/how-to-budget-with-the-one-number-strategy/  target= _blank >The One-Number Strategy: A New Approach to Budgeting</a><br /> <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/2014/07/how-to-budget-with-the-one-number-strategy/  target= _blank >The One-Number Strategy: A New Approach to Budgeting</a><br /> <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/setting-financial-goals/  target= _blank >Checklist: I Want to Set Financial Goals for Myself</a><br /> <br /> <em><a href= https://www.learnvest.com/  target= _hplink >LearnVest</a> is a program for your money. <a href= http://www.learnvest.com/category/life-and-money/  target= _hplink >Read our stories</a>, <a href= https://www.learnvest.com/personal-financial-planning-program/#our-powerful-tools  target= _hplink >use our tools</a> and <a href= https://www.learnvest.com/s/lets-talk/  target= _hplink >talk to a Planner</a> about getting a <a href= https://www.learnvest.com/personal-financial-planning-program/  target= _hplink >financial plan</a> designed for you.</em><br /> <br /> <em>LearnVest Planning Services is a registered investment adviser and subsidiary of LearnVest, Inc. that provides financial plans for its clients.

These thieves are on the lookout for ways to gain access to your valuable personal information that they can use for their own financial gain. Oftentimes, in fact more frequently than you might guess, thieves get through by social engineering.  <br /> <br /> Social engineering is the practice of deceiving someone &mdash; in person, over the phone, or by using a computer &mdash; with the express intent of breaching some level of personal or professional security.  Social engineering techniques are con games performed by con artists. And once these con games have started, they can be difficult to detect and stop. In fact, the targets of social engineering may never realize that they have been victimized.  <br /> <br /> Criminals use social engineering tactics because they are easier than finding ways to hack into your bank or email account. Social engineering tactics take advantage of your natural inclination to trust. All a criminal needs to get started is a tiny bit of information, information that might be public knowledge or that you might innocently share. A criminal may need nothing more than a Facebook post identifying your location and family members or a weak password. Social engineering happens when people are too trusting or when they don't think about the consequences of being careless with information. <br /> <br /> You can protect yourself from social engineering techniques by following these tips:  <br /> <br /> <ol><li>Don't respond to ANY email or social network post or message that asks for money or confidential information. Thieves can hack email and social network accounts, and then pose as a friend or family member to gain your trust.</li><br /> <br /> <li>Don't assume that an unsolicited phone call or email is actually from a trusted source. Just because the caller or writer has bits of information about you or your past activities doesn't mean the correspondence is legitimate.</li><br /> <br /> <li>Verify, verify, verify. If someone calls or sends an email informing you there is a problem with your online banking account or credit card account, don't act on it. If it's a phone call, Hang up and call the financial institution or credit card issuer directly. If it's an email, delete it (don't open any attachments) and then check the account directly instead.</li><br /> <br /> <li>Be conscious of what can be learned about you. Many kinds of online accounts, including online banking, use challenge questions as part of their security systems. Choose answers that are known only to you and that can't be found online. Remember, even the most innocent email attachments can be infected with computer malware. If you aren't sure the file came from a legitimate business, charity or person, don't open it. </li><br /> <br /> <li>Be aware of the information you're sharing -- both verbally and through social media sites.</li><br /> <br /> <li>Do not provide personal information or information about you or your family unless you are certain of a person's authority to have the information.</li><br /> <br /> <li>Pay attention to the URL of a website. Malicious websites may look identical to a legitimate site, but the URL may use a variation in spelling or a different domain (e.g., .com vs. .net).</li><br /> <br /> <li>Make good use of your shredder. Shred anything with any kind of personal data on it, especially if it has financial information.  </li><br /> <br /> <li>Consider enrolling in a credit monitoring service. Be on the lookout for both identity theft and credit card fraud by checking your account balances and credit scores regularly.</li></ol><br />  <br /> Stopping targeted identity theft takes education and vigilance. People who succeed at social engineering aren't evil geniuses outsmarting expensive technological defenses. Instead, these criminals sometimes pretend to be earnest and unassuming. They ask a lot of questions and use the answers to commit their crimes. <br /> <br /> The weak link is the human who accepts the person or scenario at face value. It doesn't matter how many locks and deadbolts are on your doors and windows, or if you have guard dogs, floodlights, alarm systems and fences with barbed wire. If you trust the person at the gate who says he is the appraiser sent by your insurance company and you let him in without first checking to see if he is legitimate, you are exposing yourself to unnecessary risk. <br /> <br /> Given this reality, the solution is simple: be vigilant and never let your guard down. Resources like <a href= http://www.creditsesame.com/  target= _hplink >Credit Sesame</a>, where you can monitor and protect your credit and identity for free, can help you limit the impact of identity theft and protect your financial standing. <br /> <br /> Remember to be smart about protecting your information as much as possible. Identity thieves use it to steal; without it, they can do nothing. "	"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 12:44:49 -0500"	"money"
"Smart People: Bad Financial Decisions"	"Why do smart people make poor decisions?  More importantly, why do they keep making poor decisions?  Perhaps they study stocks, market fluctuations, or market indicators.  Only a fractional percentage of investors, both professional and amateur, manage to <a href= http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/01/19/try-as-you-might-you-probably-cant-beat-the-stock-market/  target= _hplink > beat  the market</a>.  Is their occasional above-average return a fluke?  What does it show us?  According to neuroeconomics, the field dedicated to explaining what is behind human decision making, our brains seek out patterns.  When we discover a pattern, or, sense there might be one, the body's response is to flood the brain with dopamine -- as if an opiate (i.e., heroin) is in our system.   And the dopamine-flooded mind is neither objective nor dispassionate.  Judith Glaser noted in the <a href= https://hbr.org/2013/02/break-your-addiction-to-being  target= _hplink >Harvard Business Review</a>, dopamine causes one to  ...feel good, dominant, even invincible.  The irrational appears rational -- and one's investments are affected accordingly.  Non-objective thinking can manifest in several ways.<br /> <br /> But this overconfidence which is likely to afflict do-it-yourself investors is something they cannot see.  The consequences to the overconfident investor's portfolio can wreak havoc worse than greed.  An investor may know the stock market has seen <a href= http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303824204579423222177487850  target= _hplink >an average return of 10 percent over the past century</a> despite market fluctuations and still lose sight of the big picture in the moment.  Even when statistics reveal to us we are behaving irrationally, it is in our hardwired biological nature to persevere.  <br /> <br /> <a href= http://books.simonandschuster.com/Your-Money-and-Your-Brain/Jason-Zweig/9781416539797  target= _hplink ><em>Your Money and Your Brain</em></a> by Jason Zweig provided an unabashed and comprehensive look at the many ways our  intelligent  decisions are shaped.  Decisions, when shaped by our biological responses, are not purely objective -- and often are not so smart.  Messengers of financial industry use this to their advantage.  The wildly gesturing doom-and-gloom finance pundits understand this well -- as do brokers and financial product salespeople.  Our brains quickly react to evocative images of a busy trading floor or the pulsing activity behind the reporter's head, indicating the market's ups and downs -- and we react.  <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-solin/are-you-compelled-to-make_b_487515.html  target= _hplink >Dan Solin</a> writes,<br /> <br /> <blockquote>Those who study finance regard these activities as counter-productive and calculated to enhance the wealth of the securities industry and deplete the assets of investors... Perhaps investors need the equivalent of drug rehabilitation to reprogram their brains so they can rationally assess the overwhelming data indicating that reliance on the traditional securities industry for investment advice is no different than relying on a drug dealer for advice about kicking a drug habit.</blockquote><br /> <br /> Another detriment to our investment health is prediction.   Unlike other animals, humans believe we're smart enough to forecast the future even when we have been explicitly told that it is unpredictable,  writes Zweig.  Even after a group of people in an experiment, trying to determine a pattern of flashing lights were told it was a random occurrence, they continued in their pursuit of a pattern.  Rats and pigeons outscored the humans.  <br /> <br /> Investors are also prone to self-interest.  While that may seem reasonable or advantageous, self-interest is subjective -- so objective analysis becomes marred.  This occurs in many instances including clinical trials sponsored by drug companies as well as in politics.  In <a href= http://www.amazon.com/Think-Again-Leaders-Decisions-Happening/dp/1422126129  target= _hplink ><em>Think Again</em></a>, Sydney Finkelstein, Jo Whitehead, and Andrew Campbell take a look back at the end of the Cold War where Reagan and Gorbachev demonstrated biases well beyond their different viewpoints.  Each one perceived a different occurrence in the room than what had actually taken place.  And both leaders were sure their observation and experience was correct.   Reagan and Gorbachev appear not only to have been unconscious of the influence of their own interests; they also believed they were behaving honorably by offering significant concessions -- while the other party was not,  write the authors.  Investors are equally prone to a self-serving bias where self-interest skews one's view of reality.  <br /> <br /> So what can investors do to  beat  neuroeconomic factors?<br /> <br /> <strong>Have a written investment policy statement -- and stick to it.</strong><br /> The investors who successfully keep as well as grow their wealth have a written plan.  Its significance prevails over market conditions as those conditions change.  This not only offers a road map of investments, strategies, and goals, but offers a stress-management plan of sorts.  Action items might be included to describe what steps the investor would take given specific situations.  One example might be:  If the assets in the portfolio drop 25 percent, money will be moved from the best-performing investments to purchase underperforming stocks. <br /> <br /> <strong>Don't forget history -- and the fact that it repeats itself.</strong><br /> Remembering that we've lived through this type of volatility, and much worse, before, may ease nervous investors. Don't forget: Those with a long-term focus who bought into the stock market during the lows of 2008 and 2009 came out ahead over time.<br /> <br /> Keep an open mind about the future.  We tend to see one future. We don't tend to see the spectrum of possibilities,  Mr. Benartzi says.  When one of those other futures happens, whether it's good or bad, we're totally shocked. <br /> <br /> <strong>Maintain focus on long-term goals.</strong><br /> The difference between those who have their eye on their goals vs. those who do not can be dramatic.  Keeping the focus on the long view could lessen the immediacy of feeling we must respond to our emotional impulses and inclinations based on what happens in any given day.  <br />   It's crucial for investors to train their brains to focus on future goals,  says Richard Peterson, managing director of MarketPsych, a research and consulting firm.<br /> <br /> <strong>Curtail exposure to sensationalistic data and news.</strong><br /> Many people enjoy watching the uptick of their stocks -- the down tick is not as enjoyable.  However, repeatedly seeking out information via websites, apps, or in the news, particularly with so much financial information available at our fingertips 24/7, can skew judgment.  Remember that content is designed to capture attention; market news is no different.  This does not mean remain in the dark.  Check balances on a regular basis to make it easier to handle any short-run volatility and be cognizant of a portfolio's activities.  But it's a case for many readers where less may be more.<br /> <br /> The best investors habitually stay the course in spite of the setbacks and flood of information they invariably face.  And when they encounter a hurdle, they act objectively.  Success is not necessarily born from what they know, but, how steady they can be in the storm of market ups and downs.  Successful investors expect setbacks and stay in the game anyway.<br /> <br /> <em>No discussion or information contained in this article serves as the receipt of, or as a substitute for, personalized investment or legal advice from Abernathy Group II LLC.

"Debunking Myths: All Financial Advisers Tell the Truth"	"If you are like most people you assume financial advisers work in a regulated industry that requires them to tell the truth. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br /> <br /> If you still believe in Santa Claus, you may believe advisers are supposed to tell the truth by not omitting pertinent information and misrepresenting other information that impacts your financial decisions. <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-10-financialadviserstruth.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-10-financialadviserstruth.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-10-financialadviserstruth-thumb.jpg  width= 463  height= 570  /></a><br /> There is no Santa and most advisers do not tell the truth. The use of the word  supposed  should tip you off to what is really going on. It is critical that you know the truth about advisers so you can protect your financial interests.<br /> <br /> You may be asking how advisers get away with omission and misrepresentation. Good question.  I happen to know how they get away with it. <br /> <br /> <strong>Verbal</strong><br /> <br /> You may have noticed in your dealings with financial advisers that 90% of the information that they provide you is verbal. You have no written record of what was said to you. This is not accidental. If there is a dispute it is your word against theirs. You will lose because you have no  proof  of what was said to you. <br /> <br /> <strong>Enforcement</strong> <br /> <br /> There are three regulatory agencies based on an advisers licensing and registration. The principal agency is <a href= http://www.finra.org/  target= _hplink >FINRA.org</a>. You can use its BrokerCheck service to check the compliance record of 675,000 stockbrokers and other types of salesmen.<br /> <br /> Ask yourself this question? How do FINRA, the <a href= http://www.sec.gov/  target= _hplink >SEC</a>, and the States regulate verbal information? They don't. You are up the proverbial creek without a paddle. Why do you think the information is verbal? The industry knows you need documentation to win any disputes that may occur.<br /> <br /> <strong>Disclosure Requirements</strong><br /> <br /> Perhaps the most egregious behavior by the financial service industry is the lack of any type of mandatory disclosure requirement. That's right there are none. The industry has made it your exclusive responsibility to ask the right questions and know good answers from bad ones. In other words, you are on your own.<br /> <br /> How big is the problem? A survey done in early 2014 showed only 7% of individual investors asked financial advisers to document key information for their credentials, ethics, business practices, and expenses. 92% made decisions based on verbal information that was controlled by advisers - big mistake.<br /> <br /> You would be right to assume this is a massive problem for millions of Americans who do not even know the problem exists.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Against Goliath</strong><br /> <br /> By now you may have figured out that it is you against goliath (<a href= http://iwd.paladinregistry.com/wall-street/problem-wall-street/  target= _hplink >Wall Street</a>). You need assets that will help you achieve your financial goals, in particular a comfortable, secure retirement. Wall Street needs your assets to maximize revenues, profit, executive bonuses, and adviser incomes. This major conflict of interest makes Wall Street your adversary, even when it says it wants to be your new best buddy.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://iwd.paladinregistry.com/wall-street/avoid-wall-street-corruption-taking-charge/  target= _hplink >Only you can protect your financial interests</a>. The regulatory agencies are not going to protect you - they don't know you exist. Your adviser is not going to protect you - he needs your assets to produce income and keep his job.<br /> <br /> This is not the message you get on TV, but it is true. It is you and only you. It should not be this way, but it is. If you want someone to blame, you can blame Wall Street. It created this toxic environment to benefit itself.<br /> <br /> <strong>About the Author</strong>: <em>Jack Waymire worked in the financial services industry for 28 years.

"How Code Empowers Social Good: The Nest Labs Story"	"Nest Labs is best known for beautifully designed smart devices like thermostats and smoke alarms. Recently I caught up with Maxime Veron, Head of Product Management at Nest to take a deeper look at the company's initiatives in the areas of social good, artificial intelligence(AI) and their vision for the future of the smart home.<br /> <br /> <img alt= 2014-11-24-nest_labs_hand_heatingsaeedjabbar.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-24-nest_labs_hand_heatingsaeedjabbar-thumb.png  width= 570  height= 388  /><br /> Credit: Nest<br /> <br /> <strong>How would you describe Nest?</strong><br /> Nest reinvents unloved but essential products in the home. While devices like phones and computers have improved dramatically over the years, many of the products in our homes - products we rely on everyday to keep us comfortable, safe, and help us save energy - look and function the same way they have for decades. <strong>Nest is focused on making these products and our homes more thoughtful.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>What are the unique values that are inherent in Nest's DNA?</strong> <br /> At Nest we believe home is a special place. It's where we live; where we spend most of our time; where we can be our true selves. We put the home and the end user at the center of our ideas, of our products. Everything we do is aimed at helping people feel at home wherever they are. That's why the first question we ask ourselves isn't what a product will do, but what problem it will solve.<br /> <br /> <strong>Where does balance lie between great design and utility?</strong> <br /> Most of the products in our homes were designed for an industrial past. Only over time did they make the transition from offices to homes. <strong>We make products with the consumer in mind - products that people actually want to buy and install on their walls and ceilings for the next seven to ten years.</strong> It's crucial that they look great, and deliver on their promise day in, day out, for the next decade or more.<br /> <br /> <strong>With updates like  enhanced auto schedule  how is software changing the way Nest designs its hardware? </strong><br /> Software allows us and our developers to create features and experiences that extend the capabilities of our product hardware. For example, our products get better over time, with new features being automatically delivered over Wi-Fi to our customers. <br /> <br /> Our Nest Developer Program also makes it possible for companies like Whirlpool, Jawbone and LIFX to work with Nest to form meaningful connections like appliances that know not to run when energy prices are high or light bulbs that flashed when your smoke alarm went off.<br /> <br /> <strong>Has Nest tapped into Google's assets like Google X to improve your current AI and machine learning capabilities?</strong> <br /> <br /> We have <strong>a fantastic algorithm and machine learning team at Nest led by Yoky Matsuoka, who won a MacArthur genius grant and helped found Google X. </strong><br /> <br /> One of the reasons we're excited about working with Google is the chance to tap into their incredible wealth of talent.  We're always looking to improve our products and better serve consumers, and we're open to any and all ideas that will help us do that.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are some initiatives that are being taken to increase Nest's social & environmental responsibility?</strong><br /> <br /> We focus on reducing waste and using energy wisely. It's important to us to practice what we preach. Every day we see more that we could do and we plan to do it. But here's where we are now:<br /> <ul><li>No hazardous substances.</li><br /> <li>Worker safety. We're continuing to develop our auditing process for worker safety and are certified in compliance with local labor laws in manufacturing regions.</li><br /> <li>Sustainability. We're working with well-known corporations overseas in order to source from companies who are committed to improving social and environmental practices.</li></ul><br /> <br /> We also bought and refurbished a bright blue fire truck to help educate kids and parents about the importance of fire safety. We've worked with LEED to help make more buildings energy efficient. Installing a Nest Thermostat will get you a LEED credit.  <br /> <br /> <center><blockquote class= twitter-tweet  lang= en ><p><a href= https://twitter.com/hashtag/NestFiretruck?src=hash >#NestFiretruck</a> spotted taking a breather beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. <a href= http://t.co/dZMZOZiRhA >pic.twitter.com/dZMZOZiRhA</a></p>— Nest (@nest) <a href= https://twitter.com/nest/status/532246384498708482 >November 11, 2014</a></blockquote><br /> <script async src= //platform.twitter.com/widgets.js  charset= utf-8 ></script></center><br /> <br /> <strong>What's your vision for the ideal smart home?</strong><br /> Our goal is not to make the Jetsons home come to life - a home where one button lowers the shades, turns up the lights, and starts the record player. We don't think people want that.  A connected home requires considering everyone in it, because everyone has their own unique habits and preferences. <br /> <br /> You shouldn't have to buy a kit or a whole-home system for products to work together. <strong>A more thoughtful home should start with great, thoughtful products. Those products should then be able to talk to each other, work together and think for themselves - taking care of you instead of the other way around.</strong> We will achieve this over the next few years with a combination of Nest and Works With Nest products.<br /> <br /> <strong>Do you have any advice for startups looking to enter smart home industry?</strong><br /> <br /> Tony Fadell, our CEO, likes to say that <strong>one of the most important lessons he learned from Steve Jobs at Apple was that what you choose not to include in a product is just as important as what you choose to include.</strong>  <br /> It's very tempting in tech and in the connected home industry in particular to do something just because you can. <strong>It's harder to stay focused on solving big problems, keep things simple and create a few products that work really well.</strong>  <br /> <br /> <strong>Where do you envision Nest 5 years from now?</strong> <br /> Without giving too much away, we'd like to continue doing what we're doing - making best-in-class products that work well by themselves and even better together. <br /> <br /> We want to keep offering software and services that allow those products to do even more. And <strong>we'd like to keep growing the ecosystem of products that work with Nest to make our homes a little more thoughtful.</strong><br /> <br /> <iframe id='poll-embed-code-24' width='100%' src='http://dashboard.getpyne.com/polls/embed/24-hp-nest-3/1.html' frameborder='0'></iframe><script src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/pyne-elite/iframeResizer.js'></script><script>iFrameResize({heightCalculationMethod: 'lowestElement'}, '#poll-embed-code-24');</script><br /> <br /> <strong>Join the discussion by leaving a comment and sharing the article with your friends</strong> "	"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 12:12:45 -0500"	"code"
"You Can Create The Perfect Password. Here's How"	"Are you one of those people who's still using  baseball  or your home address for all your passwords? We shouldn't have to tell you this, but having super simple login information is one of the easiest ways for hackers to get access to everything from your Netflix account to your bank account.<br /> <br /> We rounded up some of the most useful tips for creating and keeping track of your passwords, to better protect your personal information online:<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Avoid the obvious (just like this tip)</strong> <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, passwords like  123456  and  password  <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/22/most-common-passwords-2013_n_4646352.html  target= _hplink >are still the most used</a>. Don't. Do. This. Hackers can use a simple <a href= http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/  target= _hplink >dictionary attack</a>, where programs create and enter dictionary word-and-number combinations to get into your accounts easily.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Turn phrases into codes</strong><br /> <br /> As HuffPost blogger and online security expert <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-siciliano/change-your-password-worl_b_5300944.html  target= _hplink >Robert Siciliano</a> recently explained, a good way to pick a password you won't forget is to convert a phrase about yourself into an acronym. For example, you should turn a sentence like “My college roommate was from a dairy farm in Wisconsin” into “McrwfadfiWI.”<br /> <br /> <center><img src= http://www.nursebuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/medical-GIFs.gif ><br /> <em>You don't have to try pronouncing them.</em></center><br /> <br /> <strong>3. Mix up letters and numbers</strong><br /> <br /> Sites will often tell you to use a combination of numbers, letters and symbols, but that doesn’t matter if you’re still using obvious words and numbers like  Password1234!  Instead, try making letters into numbers, or adding numbers in the middle of an acronym password. So to make the example password from Tip 2 even better, we'd change  McrwfadfiWI  to “Mcr1444wfadfiWI.” <br /> <br /> <strong>4. Use 12 characters or more</strong><br /> <br /> Any password is crackable, but longer ones are harder to figure out. Sure, there are <a href= http://www.bu.edu/infosec/howtos/how-to-choose-a-password/  target= _hplink >645 trillion possible combinations</a> for an eight-character password. But that number jumps exponentially each time you add a letter. <a href= http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/innovation/08/20/super.passwords/  target= _hplink >According to researchers at Georgia Tech</a>, it could take 17,134 years to crack a 12-character password.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Don't reuse or recycle</strong><br /> <br /> If you've got the same password for all your logins, one breach can endanger every account you have. Make sure to change your passwords periodically, and avoid just going back and forth between a handful.<br /> <br /> <center><img src= http://i.imgur.com/WPr1d.gif ><br /> <em>Leaks happen, so don't make it easy.</em></center><br /> <br /> <strong>6. Personalize by site</strong><br /> <br /> If you insist on repeating, at least add a few extra symbols that correspond to various sites, making your logins safer if one of your accounts is compromised. So for the example password above, adding a  FBK  to the password for a Facebook login could be one way to use it more than once: “FBK.Mcr1440wfadfiWI. <br /> <br /> <strong>7. Stay logged off</strong><br /> <br /> While it’s convenient to store your passwords in your browser on your computer and smartphone, that's the easiest way for someone to get quick access to accounts and data if your device is stolen or compromised. Just uncheck the  remember me  option and take the few seconds to type in your password. <br /> <br /> <center><img alt= facebook log in  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2061070/thumbs/o-FACEBOOK-LOG-IN-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <em>The time you spend retyping will be less stressful than being hacked.</em></center><br /> <br /> <strong>8. Add two-step verification</strong><br /> <br /> Two-step verification helps protect even the strongest passwords from being hacked. The feature forces you to enter a code that's sent to your phone or email address in order to get into your account. <a href= http://lifehacker.com/5938565/heres-everywhere-you-should-enable-two-factor-authentication-right-now  target= _hplink >Here's a list of sites</a> that support it. <br /> <br /> <strong>9. Keep a backup</strong><br /> <br /> Your passwords should be easy to remember, but we all have those forgetful days. Security expert Robert Siciliano suggests keeping an Excel file in a program like Google Drive or Dropbox that is cloud-accessible and also behind two-factor authentication. He also advises storing a physical copy in a safe in case of emergency. Of course, that paper will need to be updated every time you make a change.<br /> <br /> <strong>10. Use a password manager</strong><br /> <br /> <center><img alt= lastpass screen  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2061150/thumbs/o-LASTPASS-SCREEN-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <em>LastPass will store and generate passwords for an unlimited number of sites.</em></center><br /> <br /> The easiest way to remember and feel safe about entering your passwords across all sites is to use a password management tool.

"Lessons Learned: 3 Requirements For Sustainable Civic Apps"	"One of the best known civic mobile app contests is the <a href= http://nycbigapps.com  target= _blank >NYC BigApps Challenge</a>. The competition has attracted hundreds of teams from around the world, all vying for high dollar prizes and the promise of a coveted contract with the City of New York. Since the contest's inception five years ago, hundreds of apps have been launched - with last year's winners alone <a href= http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/215-13/mayor-bloomberg-winners-nyc-bigapps-fourth-annual-competition-create-apps-using  target= _blank >sharing a prize</a> pool of over $150,000.<br /> <br /> For the winners, it is well worth the effort. The prize money, especially considering that no stake in equity is taken from the winning team or company, is of high enough dollar amount to recoup costs for time spent developing, testing and deploying the app - and possibly make a small profit depending on the size of the team. Along with prize money, there is also the value of international <a href= http://www.forbes.com/sites/techonomy/2014/09/12/how-open-data-is-transforming-city-life/  target= _blank >publicity generated</a> for finalists and winners.<br /> <br /> But what of the hundreds of apps that aren't winners, which earn neither publicity nor money? An <a href= http://victormlgh.blogspot.com/2013/02/open-data-and-app-competitions-case-of.html  target= _blank >in-depth study</a> that followed the apps submitted for the 2011 competition reported that only 35% of the applications could be verified as still working one year later. The apps which integrated multiple sources of data along with user-generated content were the most likely to still be in use, but even among those apps, almost half were no longer being supported. That is a lot of time, programming talent, and effort expended on projects with very little reward beyond the experience.<br /> <br /> This is only one contest with one study, so perhaps the results would trend differently with larger samples, but I'm not so sure. As the founder and CEO of APPCityLife, a <a href= http://www.appcitylife.com  target= _blank >startup</a> delivering a global platform with sustainable options for developing and maintaining useful mobile apps for cities, I have heard this story told all too often by hackathon organizers, city leaders and civic hackers. In fact, in a private conversation with our team, the founder of one of the world's largest civic hacking groups went as far as expressing regret for launching the group due to the growing challenges of leveraging short-term volunteer labor to create longterm solutions for communities - not because solutions aren't needed but because most of the events hosted by his organization delivered very little in the way of viable product - and when a completed project was deployed, finding funding and an entity to deliver continued support was an even more difficult proposition.<br /> <br /> Here is what I believe must happen if we, as a global community, want to effectively exploit the power of mobile apps to address the growing civic demand for access to information and communication via mobile.<br /> <br /> <strong>Free Labor Is Not A Sustainable Solution</strong><br /> <br /> While most of us have likely participated in volunteer efforts focused on a personal passion, very few of us can sustain full time or long term involvement without enough financial benefit to cover our day to day expenses. Even as a corporation, our team can only provide charitable support to a limited number of worthy institutions. This whole  <em>build it and they will come</em>  notion that somehow all that is necessary is for cities to send their data out into the ether and then the data will be embraced by developers and integrated into useful tools solving pain points for citizens for free is short-sighted. While open data most definitely accessed and used in very valuable ways beyond building mobile apps, it is important to realize that when it comes to this particular aspect of open data, free is not a sustainable solution.<br /> <br /> Students, community groups and individuals are usually more than willing to show up for a day or a weekend to attempt to address local issues, brainstorm solutions and begin the hard work of building out the technology needed to bring that solution to viable product, more often that not, a day or a weekend is just not enough time. And expecting these groups or individuals to continue work over long periods of time without financial remuneration is not only unreasonable, it is not good business. Without proper funding, solutions are not easily maintained, updated, or grown to add new features. It is one of the reasons we spent almost a year building a real time coupon server where geolocated, targeted offers are deployed on the fly on a local level. By offering revenue share models where income generated through mobile coupons, sponsorships and advertising is shared with those creating solutions for their community, there is proper incentive for apps to be sustained longterm. And it works - our first public school app went out the door already generating more revenue for the school district than was spent on development or support fees.<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Data Must Be Normalized For Affordable Mobile Integration</strong><br /> <br /> Since most open data is being delivered from legacy servers with myriad formats, the challenge of integrating multiple data sets that are structured differently is a difficult challenge even for experienced programmers. When our team began work on our own global open data app, we experienced first-hand the challenge of developing an app accessing data feed from a variety of sources, including companies like Socrata or Junar as well as data produced by in-house teams in other cities. Instead of tackling each of the data sets individually, we stopped production on the app and took a month to build an incredible piece of technology - a world-class open data server which analyzes data from almost any source and normalize it on the fly for immediate use in mobile as everything from charted city budgets to real-time mapped locations of food trucks. It almost feels like magic happens when an open data feed is added and then appears as a readable chart within seconds. And the best benefit of automating complex coding is greatly reduced requirements of both skill level and time to produce a finished product, meaning that an app that might cost six figures and take months with custom coding can be produced in a few days or weeks and supported for as little as a few thousand dollars a year - and generated advertising revenue can often cover or exceed those costs.<br /> <br /> <strong>Make Mobile Development Accessible to Non-Developers</strong><br /> <br /> During a recent meeting with the CIO of a city on the West Coast, it was mentioned that the majority of people who attend the civic hackathons his city hosts arrive with almost all of the right ingredients: passion, ideas, and willingness to work as a team. What is missing from the majority of the attendees is the one skill needed to create mobile apps for civic solutions, mainly the ability to code. And after his team reviewed numerous platforms available on the market today, none provided the depth of flexibility or the sophistication needed to enable non-developers to create powerful civic apps that would actually solve the problem being addressed. It is one of the many motivators behind our decision to make the necessary upgrades to our platform to offer a version which graphic artists, web developers, and passionate activists could comfortably use. It is vital that as a global community, we enable those who are most willing and able to solve problems to access tools that enable them to finish the job in hours or days instead of months. After news of our first successful bootcamp this past weekend - the first time anyone outside of our own team gained access to our platform - requests for a spot on a waiting list to access this platform have already started pouring in from those in attendance to as far away as South America, Europe and Africa.<br /> <br /> If we want open data initiatives to truly succeed and become the conduit for useful mobile tools in our communities, we must offer options for funded projects and provide access to powerful tools which serve as stepping stones for STEM. Only then can we create sustainable public-private partnerships. We will all reap the benefits of more available civic mobile solutions when we come to the place that the only limit holding us back is time. "	"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 17:04:41 -0400"	"code"
"Protect Your Node.js Sources With JScrambler Before Unleashing it Into the Wild Wild Web"	"Innovation on the Internet is driving businesses to look for faster and more cost-effective ways to build applications. Node.js, a runtime environment and library for running applications written in JavaScript outside the browser, has <a href= http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/20/node-js-are-you-part-of-the-conversation-yet/ >emerged in the last few years</a> and has really benefit from this necessity. One of the advantages is straightforward: if you combine Node.js with other client-side JavaScript libraries such as AngularJS, you can use only JavaScript to develop both the server and the client sides of your Web Application. <br /> <br /> Thus, you'll probably need a smaller team of JavaScript developers to quickly take your idea from paper to an available product in the market. But Node.js is not just for startups. <a href= http://nodejs.org/industry/ >PayPal, Yahoo and Microsoft</a> are examples of bigger companies that are actively and openly using Node.js in their infrastructures.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-01-ProtectyourNode.jssourceswithJScramblerbeforeunleashingitintotheWildWildWeb.png ><img alt= 2014-09-01-ProtectyourNode.jssourceswithJScramblerbeforeunleashingitintotheWildWildWeb.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-01-ProtectyourNode.jssourceswithJScramblerbeforeunleashingitintotheWildWildWeb-thumb.png  width= 570  height= 403  /></a><br /> <br /> If you have been around in the last few years in the Web Development world, you know for sure the acronym LAMP. Now, you have MEAN, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS and Node.js. In this development stack, JavaScript, and its sidekick JSON, go all the way, from having JSON stored in the database (i.e. MongoDB), Node.js for building server-side applications using JavaScript and JSON, Express.js, the Node.js framework for building Web Applications, and AngularJS, an open-source MVC framework for client-side JavaScript, which is backed by Google. Joyent is the name behind the creation of Node.js. They also <a href= http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2014/06/24/joyent-rolls-out-its-latest-private-cloud-in-a-box-offering-one-to-add-to-the-thousand-or-so-other-players/ >provide private clouds using Node.js stacks</a>.<br /> <br /> There's a problem however that might scare off some of the potential Node.js and JavaScript adopters: the fact that the code is stored both on the client and server as clear text files. You may consider this a problem if you host your code on a shared server that others have access to, or if you are selling your code to third parties and you lose control of whom gets access to your original source code. <br /> <br /> One solution is to avoid the problem altogether, by not betting in rich client side code, and forbid yourself from sharing hosts or sharing code at all. But that is kind of silly. The cloud brought a gazillion services you'll want to integrate with and the Web is basically a giant mashup of code. Even where you'll run some JavaScript you are developing is becoming a blur. You may write it as a server-side module, but tomorrow you may decide to run it on the client side. And that's good. We accomplish more things and quicker today than a few years ago. The other solution is to use JavaScript obfuscation to make your code as protected as possible.<br /> <br /> <em> JScrambler uses source code obfuscation techniques to transform your code into a completely garbled format. On top of that, it installs a number of different code traps that gives your code tools to protect it. For instance, it can make your code detect tampering and break down on purpose </em> - said Pedro Fortuna, JScrambler's CTO. In the end of the day, you can reduce piracy drastically, stop competitors from snooping your code and reusing it, or <a href= http://gigaom.com/2014/06/11/node-js-project-wants-to-attract-more-users-by-getting-rid-of-contributor-license-agreements/ >avoid IP legal disputes</a>.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-01-Obfuscation_example.png ><img alt= 2014-09-01-Obfuscation_example.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-01-Obfuscation_example-thumb.png  width= 570  height= 199  /></a><br /> <br /> The newest version of <a href= https://jscrambler.com/  target= _hplink >JScrambler</a> introduces Node.js support. With this, the platform comes full circle, becoming the one solution that is able to protect anything with JavaScript. This release was fully tested with Node.js related libraries such as Express.js, Koa and Socket.io. Plus, it conveniently ships with a Node.js API client, with wrappers for <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-ivanovs/5-workflow-tools-for-fron_b_5695336.html >Grunt and Gulp</a> task runners, and a <a href= https://atom.io/packages/jscrambler >convenient plugin for the Github's Atom editor</a>. <em> We tried other solutions & tools before choosing JScrambler. The level of protection combined with excellent support and frequent updates is something we value very much. ,</em> said Hannu Alakangas, CEO of Punos Mobile Ltd.<br /> <br /> Obviously, not everyone will feel the need to protect his code. But if you are doing serious things with JavaScript, have a look at JScrambler. It is now the only full stack JavaScript protection solution and the only one that supports Node.js. So, before you deploy your application and run into a Web standoff with hackers or code thieves, make sure you've checked all your options.<br /> <br /> JScrambler has been around for almost five years, having so far protected around 150 million lines of JavaScript for users in more than 100 countries. They've just <a href= http://www.portugalventures.pt/en/news/portugal-ventures-invests-in-new-techbased-startups-3401.html >got Series A funding</a> in the beginning of this year and is now expanding its operations to the US.

Squarespace is a website builder, blogging platform and hosting service. As Hassan and Jones discuss, Squarespace began as a blogging platform. Now, in version 6, Squarespace's offerings are an extension of personal web presence and on-line identity. This discussion leads to a trip down memory lane, where everyone ponders the personal websites of yore.  <br /> <br /> <blockquote> Well, here's the thing, the other day I got kind of nostalgic about it and [found that] Geocities exists, if you know how to read Japanese,  Hassan said.  It's kind of cool, the evolution of these sites over time, and what people expect to be able to put up online and then how it looks, that to me is slowly changing as we go through time.  </blockquote><br /> <br /> After the blog history discussion, we move on to the hard tech and discuss Squarespace's tech stack, which consists of <br /> of Java, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Couchdb. The engineering team uses Jira tickets to manage the workflow and every bug report comes with an accompanying customer service ticket so that they can understand exactly what went wrong. Hassan and Jones said that every engineer receives customer feedback or input on a daily basis. <br /> <br /> Aside from web design, blogging and squarespace the crew also discusses some of the latest headlines.

"Six Mistakes to Avoid When Writing Code for the Internet of Things"	"The coming wave of  Internet of Things  (IoT) products - i.e., the integration of operating systems and Internet connectivity into hardware products like appliances, electronics, sensors, robotics, cars, etc. - promises to be one of the biggest booms in software development in recent memory. While mobile apps are expected to generate $77 billion in revenue by 2017, IoT expectations are considerably higher - Gartner estimates $309 billion annually by 2020, and Cisco has a much more dramatic projection of a $19 trillion market by 2020.<br /> <br /> But a key problem we're already seeing with IoT products is that security is clearly an afterthought. At the upcoming <a href= http://blackhat.com/us-14/  target= _hplink >Black Hat</a> conference, which kicks of August 2nd in Las Vegas, hackers will be unveiling a number of serious flaws in IoT products, including cars, home automation, thermostats, home alarms, etc. Companies like Intel, Google, Samsung, Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco, AT&T and IBM, which are already taking an active role in Internet of Things development, will soon be placing a greater emphasis on risk-mitigation with these products - and developers who can deliver on security, in addition to performance and UX, are likely to be a step ahead of the competition. <br /> <br /> So what are some steps developers should take today to improve their coding for IoT products? Here are the top six security issues to address:<br /> <br /> <ol><li><strong>Attack Surface -</strong> Many IoT developers today don't do a good enough job of limiting the surface area of the devices they create. Allowing access to I/O interfaces or APIs that do not need to be on the network exposes them to <em>remote code execution</em> attacks, which could result in a total takeover of the device. Remote code execution occurs when an attacker can inject data into an accessible I/O interface or API on a device and send maliciously crafted data that, due to a vulnerability in the code processing the data, causes the device to begin executing the supplied data as if it was code. A good example of the potential harm with remote code execution is Barnaby Jack's famous <a href= http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-blog/2012-02-29-hacker-shows-off-lethal-attack-by-controlling-wireless-medical-device/  target= _hplink >hack of a wireless insulin pump</a>. It's also been a problem for <a href= https://securityledger.com/2013/10/apple-store-favorite-izon-cameras-riddled-with-security-holes/  target= _hplink >home surveillance cameras</a> and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/14/wireless-baby-monitor-hack_n_3755272.html  target= _hplink >baby monitors</a>. To fix this problem, developers should create separate administrative and user interfaces and keep functionality at different security levels independent. Also, use device firewalls to restrict outside access only to those ports that are absolutely necessary.</li><br /> <li><strong>Code Injection Attacks -</strong> Just as with traditional web applications, IoT applications are vulnerable to injection attacks (<em>SQL injection, blind SQL injection, format string attack</em> and <em>buffer overflow</em>) which can corrupt processes or steal data unless the proper measures are taken to secure them ahead of time. One example is a video conferencing product developer which was previously reported as susceptible to <a href= http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/213486  target= _hplink >arbitrary code injection</a>, according to US CERT. In order to prevent injection threats, developers should follow relevant software security requirements, avoid dangerous APIs, reduce the exposed interfaces, use managed languages, static code analysis and hardware processing of I/O using fixed functions. </li><br /> <li><strong>Sensitive Information Disclosure -</strong> Another risk that carries over to IoT products is <em>sensitive information disclosure</em>. In the case of IoT, this could be manifested in terms of weak encryption, insecure data handling and storage, cleartext or hardcoded passwords,  garrulous  error messages, etc. Given the diverse range of IoT products, the risks could vary from <a href= http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240224012/IoT-smart-light-bulbs-get-security-update  target= _hplink >compromising the WiFi credentials</a> of smart lightbulbs, as was recently demonstrated, to accessing critical health information in medical devices. By following relevant software security requirements and using scanning tools post-development to check for flaws, developers should be able to eliminate these threats. Be especially cognizant of the value of  phone home  telemetry data and the increased value that data can have when aggregated.</li><br /> <li><strong>Using Fixed or Predictable Codes -</strong> Any device that can be remote-controlled by the user or a technician should not use fixed codes or predictable rolling codes as these will make it vulnerable to <em>unauthorized access</em> and manipulation threats. The same principle applies to implementing backdoors and sharing passwords, keys and certificates across devices. At this year's Black Hat, a security researcher will show how nearly all home alarm systems with RF remotes can be <a href= https://www.blackhat.com/us-14/briefings.html#breaking-the-security-of-physical-devices  target= _hplink >disabled using a replay attack</a>. Developers should ensure that administrators have the ability to remove or replace any such values that are in place for initial access.</li><br /> <li><strong>Secure Updates and Configuration -</strong> Another significant security challenge for IoT products is that most of them do not implement secure methods to update the software and/or firmware. This issue ranges from devices that cannot be updated at all, can only be updated via a local connection (USB or serial) and those that communicate in the clear or accept unsigned updates. This prevents security fixes and updates from getting to devices and could allow attackers to replace the operating system or application code on your IoT device. One real-world example is Google's Nest thermostat, which researchers revealed to be vulnerable to <a href= http://blog.gtvhacker.com/2014/google-nest-exploiting-dfu-for-root/  target= _hplink >booting unsigned code</a>, allowing them to backdoor the device. Unfortunately, this is not an easy problem for the developer to address alone. Updates need to be downloaded using a secure communications protocol, they must be validated, and for rollouts of large numbers of devices, automation has to be in place to manage the entire process. Developers need to work with hardware designers to ensure that the boot and update process is secure from start to finish. Configuration of devices similarly needs to be locked down and securely transmitted when updates are made to devices.</li><br /> <li><strong>Support for IPv6 -</strong> Since the world is transitioning to IPv6, it's important for IoT developers to make these devices compatible with the new address scheme. Doing so will ensure that a company won't have to face increased costs later on when it comes to managing and growing their networked devices on limited and costly IPv4 addresses. Additionally, developers should also implement IPSec to better ensure authentication and confidentiality of data.</li></ol> "	"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 10:40:10 -0400"	"code"

But hoping to pick up technical skills she could use on the job, Aimee Morgan, 35, of Mountain View, California enrolled in an online course to learn Python, a popular programming language—and loved it. She thought about a career in computers but assumed that  to succeed, you had to have learned to program at age 11.  Then she found <a href= http://www.hackbrightacademy.com/home  target= _hplink >Hackbright Academy</a>, a coding boot camp that teaches software development to women. In her group of 25 students, Morgan was one of a few who were older than 30. But she forged ahead, and her skills landed her an entry-level job at <a href= https://www.flixster.com/homepage  target= _hplink >Flixster</a>, a website where users watch and rate movies. All her coworkers are more experienced but supportive.

"Edward Snowden's New Role: Product Pitchman"	"Edward Snowden has been given many titles: Whistleblower. Traitor. Asylum-seeker.<br /> <br /> Now, the fugitive National Security Agency contractor appears to have found a new role: Product pitchman. <br /> <br /> In recent interviews and speeches at tech conferences, where he appeared remotely via Google Hangout, Snowden has endorsed several privacy and security tools -- whether the product's makers wanted his help or not.<br /> <br /> Last week, Snowden told The Guardian that consumers should avoid the cloud storage service Dropbox, which he said was <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/17/edward-snowden-dropbox-privacy-spideroak  target= _hplink > hostile to privacy, </a> and instead use a lesser-known competitor, SpiderOak, because it makes it harder for law enforcement to obtain stored content.<br /> <br /> At the South by Southwest conference in March, Snowden <a href= http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/at-sxsw-snowden-speaks-about-n-s-a-spying/?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar  target= _hplink >recommended</a> that people use Tor, a software that allows people to use the Internet anonymously. He also touted the encryption service Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, and Open WhisperSystems, a project that built an app for encrypting text messages.<br /> <br /> In a crowded market where security companies <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/06/virtual-private-networks_n_4731731.html  target= _hplink >often claim their products are “NSA-proof,”</a> an endorsement from Snowden can be a boon to a lesser-known startup, giving it added credibility and free publicity. But some companies have learned that being good enough for Snowden can also bring unwanted scrutiny.<br /> <br /> Snowden is currently living in temporary asylum in Russia while facing theft and espionage charges in the United States for disclosing details of the NSA surveillance program to media outlets. <br /> <br /> There’s no sign he has been paid for his recent product plugs, but some say Snowden could find a lucrative new career by positioning himself as a trusted privacy expert who makes money touting tech products. Snowden also <a href= http://recode.net/2014/07/19/edward-snowden-plans-to-work-on-privacy-tech/  target= _hplink >hinted last week</a> at a technology conference that he may start developing privacy tools himself.<br /> <br /> “At some point he's going to have to make a living,” said John Pescatore, director of emerging security trends at the SANS Institute, a cybersecurity training organization. “That is probably what’s really going on here.”<br /> <br /> Ethan Oberman, co-founder of SpiderOak, said Monday that he has never met Snowden and his endorsement last week came as a “complete and total shock.” Over the weekend, the number of people signing up for SpiderOak’s services “increased dramatically,  he said.<br /> <br /> Snowden's endorsement “is not something we asked for or expected, but it’s certainly a wonderful validation of what our team has been working on for the last seven years, and I’m very thankful for that,” Oberman told HuffPost.<br /> <br /> Dropbox, for its part, has <a href= http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/17/snowden-says-drop-dropbox-use-spideroak/  target= _hplink >responded</a> to Snowden’s comments by saying that “safeguarding our users’ information is a top priority” and the company has “made a commitment in our privacy policy to resist broad government requests. <br /> <br /> But some companies have found that being associated with Snowden has its downsides. When FBI agents learned that Snowden had used Lavabit’s secure email service, they requested passwords and encryption keys for all of its customers. Lavabit’s owner, in turn, <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/us/snowdens-e-mail-provider-discusses-pressure-from-fbi-to-disclose-data.html?pagewanted=all&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar  target= _hplink >shut down the service</a> instead of handing over that information.<br /> <br /> When Snowden was <a href= http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/the-stickers-on-edward-snowdens-laptop/  target= _hplink >photographed last summer</a> with a sticker on his laptop supporting the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, it was “both an exciting moment and a scary moment,” said Dave Maass, an EFF spokesman. <br /> <br /> “We were suddenly tied to this large scandal because of a sticker,” Maass said. “We didn’t know who he was. We were suddenly in the middle of the story.”<br /> <br /> Snowden “is a controversial figure,” and some businesses might not want him endorsing their products, Maass added. <br /> <br /> “There are people who don’t like him who are going to associate him with that software,” Maass said.<br /> <br /> Pescatore said Snowden's endorsements would likely have little effect on any company’s bottom line. That’s because the general public is not so concerned with government surveillance that they are willing to adopt privacy tools that can be cumbersome. SpiderOak, for example, is unable to reset passwords, even if a person forgets his or her login information.<br /> <br /> “Small companies will get publicity, but as far as him changing adoption of these technologies, I don’t see it happening,” Pescatore said.

"How Code Empowers Social Good: The Warby Parker Story"	"Warby Parker is one of the darlings of the <strong>social enterprise movement</strong>. The eyewear brand is rapidly growing and even has its own collection of sunglasses designed by Victoria Secret model Karlie Kloss. They recently achieved the incredible milestone of <strong>giving away a million pairs of glasses</strong> to those in need through their  buy a pair give a pair  program. <br /> <br /> <center><blockquote class= twitter-tweet  lang= en ><p>We love this shot of <a href= https://twitter.com/karliekloss >@karliekloss</a> snapped by <a href= https://twitter.com/AmyTAstley >@AmyTAstley</a> tonight while celebrating our collaboration! <a href= https://twitter.com/hashtag/karliexwarby?src=hash >#karliexwarby</a> <a href= http://t.co/CbtARmynPm >pic.twitter.com/CbtARmynPm</a></p>— Warby Parker (@WarbyParker) <a href= https://twitter.com/WarbyParker/statuses/476179638410956800 >June 10, 2014</a></blockquote></center><br /> <script async src= //platform.twitter.com/widgets.js  charset= utf-8 ></script><br /> <br /> I found myself naturally being a huge fan of Warby Parker and became increasingly curious as to <strong>how technology is empowering them and their social mission through the use of software.</strong> Take the journey with me as I talk with Dave Gilboa, Co-Founder & Co-CEO and Lon Binder, Vice President of Technology at Warby Parker to find out just how they do this. <br /> <br /> <strong>Do you view Warby Parker as a technology company?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Dave:</strong> We've always thought of ourselves as a brand first but we view ourselves very much as a technology company. Ever since we conceived Warby Parker, we knew we wanted to build a technology enabled lifestyle brand. Technology is the backbone behind everything that we do as a company. <br /> <br /> <strong>Lon:</strong> There are a couple of things to think about as measures of what's a technology company. While we're not selling software, we create a tremendous amount of software in house. One of our larger projects that we've wrapped up recently was <strong>building a platform in house that we're continuing to build applications on top of. </strong>That really speaks to the level of sophistication Warby Parker has around software. <br /> <br /> <strong>What's it like scaling the accelerated growth that Warby Parker is experiencing?</strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>Lon:</strong> Scaling has been an interesting challenge at Warby Parker. We <strong>built systems that are flexible enough to accommodate both scaling vertically and horizontally</strong> in terms of customer growth and functional growth. <br /> <br /> A major decision was to move to Python as our core programing language. This is not uncommon, <strong>most of the major organizations that we speak with are shifting to having a major investment in Python</strong>. Our thinking here is aligned with support for scale, rapid prototyping and agility. Python also gave us a good balance between flexibility, performance, maturity and a large community.<br /> <br /> In terms of other components, we're <strong>using PostgreSQL for our databases</strong>. There are numerous reasons why but one of the best things is that it <strong>allows us to be as flexible as we needed to be with our schema design</strong> which enabled us to be more adaptive towards changing business needs and had a number of different engines underneath that we could take advantage of along with its very broad community.<br /> <br /> <strong>How does software empower the social conscious aspects of Warby Parker?</strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>Lon:</strong> There's a strong desire for people to do good especially in the technology universe. <strong>We have an active open source program</strong> where we give away quite a bit of software that we create. <br /> <br /> Other things are less direct to Warby Parker. Lauralynn Drury of our team who's a member of the Blue Engine Young Professionals Group, came up with a wonderful idea to <strong>donate some engineering time from Warby Parker to Blue Engine.</strong> We've done that through 2014 and completed a project for them called BEST (Blue Engine Student Tracker). You can find it along with all the other tools and software we've open sourced on our GitHub page.<br />  <br /> <img alt= 2014-07-21-warbyparkerHackathon_working.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-21-warbyparkerHackathon_working-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /><br /> Credit: Warby Parker - The Warby Parker Team Hacking Away<br /> <br /> <strong>What advice would you give to entrepreneurs looking to start a socially conscious business?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Dave:</strong> The biggest thing is recognizing that the <strong>social mission should be built in from day one.</strong> If you are building a for-profit business it has to be a profitable sustainable business that scales. We get a lot of people that are very passionate about a certain cause but when you break down the numbers you realize that the economics really aren't sustainable for what they're proposing. <br /> <br /> In some cases it might be more appropriate for a non-profit or just to rethink the economic side of things. We recognize that the bigger that we become as a business, the bigger the ultimate impact we can have on the world is. Any for-profit business needs to consider that as they build for scale.<br /> <br /> <strong>Where do you see the company 5 years from now?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Dave:</strong> It's hard for us to think that far in the future given how quickly our business is changing. We can certainly say that <strong>we will be several times the size that we're today with millions of happy customers.</strong> Five years from now we'll have a bigger global presence since there's a huge global opportunity and we'll continue to expand our product offering.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lon:</strong> One thing that is important to us internally is technology being an enabler to the companies growth which over the 5 year horizon is a tremendous challenge considering what's happening in the organization. <br /> <br /> From an external perspective <strong>it's really important for us to share our learnings</strong>. We're going through a very unique experience of very excessive growth that is changing the way eyeglasses are sold in the world and the way ecommerce and retail work together to be a better experience for customers. <br /> <br /> I hope that over the 5 year horizon not only do we learn a lot but we also share that knowledge with other companies and that they can take advantage of our experiences. <br />  <br /> What are your thoughts?

However, there is only one device that has materialized at the intersection of couture and technology. Ringly makes smart jewelry and accessories that connect to users' mobile phones via bluetooth to  put your phone away and your mind at ease.  Ringly's debut product is a cocktail ring that comes in four different styles. Each ring lights up and vibrates when the user receives a new notification, and users can customize which notifications they receive by using the Ringly app. <br /> <br /> <blockquote>“One of the reasons I started the company is I was missing things all of the time because I keep my phone in my purse,  said co-founder, Christina Mercando.  I wanted to solve that, but I also started to notice everyone around me always having to keep their phone out at the dinner table and it interrupting certain things. I love conversation and I love restaurants and eating and it’s just one of those things that bothered me that I wanted to help fix.”</blockquote><br /> <br /> Mercando and co-founder Logan Munroe worked on the launch of Ringly for a year. During that time, they went through seven product iterations and months of fundraising.

"Google Creates Elite Team To Fight Hackers -- And Maybe The NSA"	"Google said Tuesday it had created an elite team of researchers to find and report major Internet security flaws, potentially thwarting both Chinese hackers and U.S. intelligence agencies.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/  target= _hplink >In a blog post</a>, Google security engineer Chris Evans said the team, dubbed Project Zero, will hunt for bugs in widely used software and report them to vendors so they can be fixed before hackers exploit them for malicious purposes.<br /> <br /> Evans said sophisticated hackers have used software flaws to spy on human rights activists or steal trade secrets from major companies. Hackers also sell knowledge of such previously unknown bugs to other hackers or foreign governments for thousands of dollars. <br /> <br /> “You should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state-sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer, steal secrets or monitor your communications,” Evans said.<br /> <br /> “Our objective is to significantly reduce the number of people harmed by targeted attacks,” he added. <br /> <br /> The mission of Project Zero appears to run counter to the work of the National Security Agency, which has reportedly exploited software bugs as part of its controversial spying programs. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year, President Barack Obama created an exception that allows the NSA to take advantage of security flaws to collect intelligence, but only when there is “a clear national security or law enforcement need,” <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/us/politics/obama-lets-nsa-exploit-some-internet-flaws-officials-say.html  target= _hplink >The New York Times reported.</a><br /> <br /> In April, Bloomberg News <a href= http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-11/nsa-said-to-have-used-heartbleed-bug-exposing-consumers.html  target= _hplink >reported</a> the NSA knew for at least two years about the so-called Heartbleed bug -- a major Internet security flaw disclosed in April -- and exploited it to collect intelligence. U.S. officials denied the report.<br /> <br /> Google already offers security researchers <a href= https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/  target= _hplink >as much as $20,000</a> for finding and reporting security bugs in its own software. But Evans said Project Zero's mission would be much broader. The team also will hunt for bugs in other companies’ code and report them to vendors.<br /> <br /> Evans said Google was hiring “the best practically-minded security researchers and contributing 100% of their time toward improving security across the Internet. <br /> <br /> Project Zero will have 10 full-time researchers. So far, the team has enlisted several experts with some measure of fame in the security world. The team’s intern, for example, is George Hotz, <a href= http://www.wired.com/2014/07/google-project-zero/  target= _hplink >according to Wired.</a> As a teenager, Hotz became well known for being the first person to hack AT&T’s iPhone. He later hacked Sony’s Playstation 3. "	"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 18:06:35 -0400"	"code"
"This Ring Reads Books And Magazines To The Blind"	"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are developing an audio reading device to be worn on the index finger of people whose vision is impaired, giving them affordable and immediate access to printed words.<br /> <br /> The so-called FingerReader, a prototype produced by a 3-D printer, fits like a ring on the user's finger, equipped with a small camera that scans text. A synthesized voice reads words aloud, quickly translating books, restaurant menus and other needed materials for daily living, especially away from home or office.<br /> <br /> Reading is as easy as pointing the finger at text. Special software tracks the finger movement, identifies words and processes the information. The device has vibration motors that alert readers when they stray from the script, said Roy Shilkrot, who is developing the device at the MIT Media Lab.<br /> <br /> For Jerry Berrier, 62, who was born blind, the promise of the FingerReader is its portability and offer of real-time functionality at school, a doctor's office and restaurants.<br /> <br />  When I go to the doctor's office, there may be forms that I wanna read before I sign them,  Berrier said.<br /> <br /> He said there are other optical character recognition devices on the market for those with vision impairments, but none that he knows of that will read in real time.<br /> <br /> Berrier manages training and evaluation for a federal program that distributes technology to low-income people in Massachusetts and Rhode Island who have lost their sight and hearing. He works from the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, Massachusetts.<br /> <br />  Everywhere we go, for folks who are sighted, there are things that inform us about the products that we are about to interact with. I wanna be able to interact with those same products, regardless of how I have to do it,  Berrier said.<br /> <br /> <img alt= fingerreader  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1897467/thumbs/o-FINGERREADER-570.jpg  /><br /> <center><em>What FingerReader sees.</em></center><br /> <br /> Pattie Maes, an MIT professor who founded and leads the Fluid Interfaces research group developing the prototype, says the FingerReader is like  reading with the tip of your finger and it's a lot more flexible, a lot more immediate than any solution that they have right now. <br /> <br /> Developing the gizmo has taken three years of software coding, experimenting with various designs and working on feedback from a test group of visually impaired people. Much work remains before it is ready for the market, Shilkrot said, including making it work on cellphones.<br /> <br /> Shilkrot said developers believe they will be able to affordably market the FingerReader but he could not yet estimate a price. The potential market includes some of the 11.2 million people in the United States with vision impairment, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.<br /> <br /> Current technology used in homes and offices offers cumbersome scanners that must process the desired script before it can be read aloud by character-recognition software installed on a computer or smartphone, Shilkrot said. The FingerReader would not replace Braille — the system of raised dots that form words, interpreted by touch. Instead, Shilkrot said, the new device would enable users to access a vast number of books and other materials that are not currently available in Braille.<br /> <br /> Developers had to overcome unusual challenges to help people with visual impairments move their reading fingers along a straight line of printed text that they could not see. Users also had to be alerted at the beginning and end of the reading material.<br /> <br /> Their solutions? Audio cues in the software that processes information from the FingerReader and vibration motors in the ring.<br /> <br /> The FingerReader can read papers, books, magazines, newspapers, computer screens and other devices, but it has problems with text on a touch screen, said Shilkrot.<br /> <br /> That's because touching the screen with the tip of the finger would move text around, producing unintended results. Disabling the touch-screen function eliminates the problem, he said.<br /> <br /> Berrier said affordable pricing could make the FingerReader a key tool to help people with vision impairment integrate into the modern information economy.<br /> <br />  Any tool that we can get that gives us better access to printed material helps us to live fuller, richer, more productive lives, Berrier said.

"The Least Healthy States In America"	"Based on health outcomes and various health determinants, Indiana was identified as the 10th least healthy state in America.  "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 16:58:41 -0500"	"healthy"
"10 Most Healthy States In America"	"<em>This story was <a href= http://247wallst.com/special-report/2014/12/12/americas-most-and-least-healthy-states-2/#ixzz3LoaK51AX   target= _hplink >originally published</a> by 24/7 Wall St.</em><br /> <br /> Americans are by no means the healthiest people in the world. While there have been vast improvements in infant-mortality rates and smoking rates over the last several decades, the United States still struggles with obesity and diabetes in particular. Last year, the nation’s obesity rate increased to 29.4% of adults from 27.6% the year before.<br /> <br /> The United Health Foundation’s 2014 Health Rankings report examined both determinants and health outcomes. It included such factors as healthy behaviors, quality of health care, health policy, the presence of diseases and deaths from illnesses across the nation. Health varies considerably between states. Based on this year’s edition of America’s Health Rankings, Hawaii and Mississippi are once again the healthiest and least healthy states.<br /> <br /> Negative health outcomes were far less common in the healthiest states than in the least healthy ones. The prevalence of diabetes has increased dramatically in the United States in recent years, due in part to rising obesity rates. In all of the healthiest states, the rates of diabetes were less than the national rate of nearly 10% of adults. In addition, the majority of the healthiest states were also among the 10 states with the fewest cardiovascular deaths per 100,000 people.<br /> <br /> The cost of poor health can be measured in years of life. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks premature deaths, as measured by the number of years lost when people do not live to age 75. This year, the CDC estimated that nearly 7,000 years were lost for every 100,000 Americans. This figure was lower in all of the healthiest states, one of which, Massachusetts, led the nation with 5,345 estimated years lost per 100,000 people.<br /> <br /> Healthy behavior and lifestyle is also a major contributor to good health. According to Dr. Rhonda Randall, the chief medical officer for the United Retiree Solutions and a senior advisor to the United Health Foundation, the United States has tackled issues like infant mortality and smoking cessation. And “we can do that with physical inactivity and obesity. Those are things that are completely within our control,” Randall said. Less than 75% of Americans reported regular physical activity. In nine of the least healthy states, however, less than 70% of people exercised regularly.<br /> <br /> Money and employment also clearly play roles in determining health. The healthiest states are often among the nation’s wealthiest, and each had a median household income above the national median in 2013. All but one of the healthiest states also had a lower unemployment rate than the national rate of 7.4% last year. Low unemployment rates improve the likelihood of receiving health insurance, as many Americans are covered through their work. All of the healthiest states also had better coverage rates than the national coverage rate. And in three of the 10 states, the percentage of residents without health coverage was less than half the national figure of 14.6%.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://247wallst.com/special-report/2014/12/12/americas-most-and-least-healthy-states-2/2/  target= _hplink >Click here to see America’s Most (and Least) Healthy States</a><br /> <br /> Yet, according to Randall, “We know that just having health insurance isn’t enough. It’s also access to care, and making good decisions for our lifestyle choices, and then the quality of clinical care we receive when we do access the health care system.” When it comes to the quality of clinical care, once again, the healthiest states stood out. Six of these 10 states were among the top 10 nationally for the concentration of primary care physicians, and Massachusetts had more than 200 doctors for every 100,000 residents, the highest figure in the country.<br /> <br /> Randall went on to say that health really needs to be understood broadly. “It’s not just about whether you get the right care, or when you go to see your doctor, it’s also about the environment with which we live.” Environment, in this case, includes both promoting strong education and a safe environment. Ninth graders had relatively low chances of graduating high school in many of the of the least healthy states, for example. Additionally, the violent crime rates in many of these states were far higher than the national rate of 387 incidents per 100,000 people.<br /> <br /> Public policy is yet another contributor. While the United States spent $90 per capita on public health services, several of the healthiest states — Hawaii, Vermont, Massachusetts, and North Dakota — spent more than $100 per resident. Yet, a majority of the healthiest states actually spent less per capita on public health than the nation as a whole. Randall explained that “public health spending is an important measure, which is why we included it. But, it’s also important how effective the programs are that the money is used for… It is multifaceted.”<br /> <br /> Based on data provided by United Health Foundation’s America’s Health Rankings, 24/7 Wall St. examined the 10 states with the highest and lowest overall scores. These scores were based on a number of measures that fall into two separate categories: health determinants and health outcomes. Determinants were further divided into behaviors, such as smoking, community and environmental factors, such as children living in poverty; policy factors, such as public health funding and immunization rates; and clinical care factors, such as the availability of dentists and doctors. Outcomes included rates of death from cancer and cardiovascular diseases, as well as infant mortality rates. Additionally, we also reviewed supplementary data provided by America’s Health Rankings, including economic factors such as median household income based on the Current Population Suvey.<br /> <br /> These are the healthiest states in America.

It’s also access to care, and making good decisions for our lifestyle choices, and then the quality of clinical care we receive when we do access the health care system.” When it comes to the quality of clinical care, once again, the healthiest states stood out. Six of these 10 states were among the top 10 nationally for the concentration of primary care physicians, and Massachusetts had more than 200 doctors for every 100,000 residents, the highest figure in the country.<br /> <br /> Randall went on to say that health really needs to be understood broadly. “It’s not just about whether you get the right care, or when you go to see your doctor, it’s also about the environment with which we live.” Environment, in this case, includes both promoting strong education and a safe environment. Ninth graders had relatively low chances of graduating high school in many of the of the least healthy states, for example. Additionally, the violent crime rates in many of these states were far higher than the national rate of 387 incidents per 100,000 people.<br /> <br /> Public policy is yet another contributor. While the United States spent $90 per capita on public health services, several of the healthiest states — Hawaii, Vermont, Massachusetts, and North Dakota — spent more than $100 per resident. Yet, a majority of the healthiest states actually spent less per capita on public health than the nation as a whole. Randall explained that “public health spending is an important measure, which is why we included it. But, it’s also important how effective the programs are that the money is used for… It is multifaceted.”<br /> <br /> Based on data provided by United Health Foundation’s America’s Health Rankings, 24/7 Wall St. examined the 10 states with the highest and lowest overall scores. These scores were based on a number of measures that fall into two separate categories: health determinants and health outcomes. Determinants were further divided into behaviors, such as smoking, community and environmental factors, such as children living in poverty; policy factors, such as public health funding and immunization rates; and clinical care factors, such as the availability of dentists and doctors. Outcomes included rates of death from cancer and cardiovascular diseases, as well as infant mortality rates. Additionally, we also reviewed supplementary data provided by America’s Health Rankings, including economic factors such as median household income based on the Current Population Suvey.<br /> <br /> These are the healthiest states in America.

"Is Sleep Apnea Related to the 'Sperm Crisis'?"	"The past decade or so has seen the development a worrisome trend in fertility studies -- evidence that suggests the possibility of broad declines in male sperm quality. In particular, a French study <a href= http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/121-a46/  target= _hplink >released </a>in 2012 found significant declines in sperm quality among French men over a 17-year period between 1989 and 2005. The average age of the men in the <a href= http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/12/02/humrep.des415.abstract  target= _hplink >study</a> was 34-36 years old over the duration of the study period. During this nearly two-decade timeframe, average sperm concentration fell an alarming 32 percent. This isn't the only study to identify widespread decreases in sperm quality -- other <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19098968  target= _hplink >investigations</a> worldwide have <a href= http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01485010390129296  target= _hplink >returned</a> <a href= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2605.2010.01133.x/abstract;jsessionid=75076135B53BE65FC0CF419974958615.f03t01  target= _hplink >similar</a> results. But this latest research elevated the sense of alarm over the public health ramifications of potentially diminished fertility in men, and led many to wonder whether we're facing a  sperm crisis.  <br /> <br /> If the sperm studies are in fact representative of a downward trend in male fertility, the question becomes: Why? What's behind the widespread decrease in sperm quality? There's not likely to be a single culprit, nor a simple answer. Results of a newly-released study suggest an intriguing possibility: Could the  sperm crisis  observed in the French study and others be at least partially the result of sleep apnea? <br /> <br /> Researchers in Spain have recently <a href= http://www.journalsleep.org/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=29734  target= _hplink >investigated</a> the relationship between OSA and male fertility. They found that the intermittent disruptions to breathing that are the hallmark of sleep apnea may lead to a decrease in fertility among men. Researchers conducted the study using male mice. Scientists induced in the mice brief, repeated periods of hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation. Their intent was to stimulate in mice the episodes of interrupted breathing that people experience when they suffer from obstructive sleep apnea. The mice were exposed to short episodes of oxygen deprivation followed by re-oxygenation for six hours a day over a period of 60 days. Scientists then assessed the fertility by allowing the mice to mate, and measuring the number of pregnancies resulting from the hypoxia mice compared to a control group of mice that had not experienced daily episodes of oxygen deprivation. The results were striking. Male mice that experienced a daily pattern of hypoxia episodes demonstrated significantly lower rates of fertility than the normal mice in the control group. The cycles of oxygen deprivation and re-oxygenation created by researchers were almost identical to what happens in people who have undiagnosed or untreated sleep apnea. <br /> <br /> It will be critically important to see additional research to support these results and to investigate the link between sleep apnea and male fertility in humans. But these findings make a strong preliminary case that the interruption of regular oxygen flow that's associated with sleep apnea may lead to diminished fertility in men. <br /> <br /> We've known for some time that OSA can have <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18997807  target= _hplink >negative</a> <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15028455  target= _hplink >effects</a> on sexual function in men (and also in <a href= http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/news/20060908/sleep-apnea-hurts-womens-sex-lives  target= _hplink >women</a>). Research <a href= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/808334  target= _hplink >has shown</a> that a significant percentage of men -- from 10 percent to 60 percent or higher -- with obstructive sleep apnea also have erectile dysfunction (ED). Scientists are still working to understand the relationship between OSA and ED, and exactly how sleep apnea may interfere with normal sexual function in men. <br /> <br /> This latest study highlights a significant trend in much of modern society: the delay of parenthood to later years, and its consequences to fertility for couple who want to have children. The <a href= http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sleepapnea/atrisk  target= _hplink >risks</a> of OSA increase with age. If in fact sleep apnea does play a part in reducing fertility, older men who seek fatherhood may be particularly vulnerable. The longer obstructive sleep apnea is left undiagnosed and untreated, the greater chance it has to do harm. <br /> <br /> These results also may provide at least a partial explanation for the two-decade decrease in sperm seen in the French study. Sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea, have been <a href= http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=5043  target= _hplink >on the rise</a> for decades. The rise in disrupted sleep may be contributing to fertility problems and may be at least one piece of the puzzle behind the  sperm crisis.  <br /> <br /> All men (and women) who suspect they may suffer from obstructive sleep apnea or any form of sleep-disordered breathing should be evaluated and seek treatment to resolve their sleep issues.  <br /> <br /> CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is the <a href= http://www.sleepeducation.com/treatment-therapy/cpap/overview  target= _hplink >most common</a> and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Often, people have concerns about wearing the apparatus necessary to receive CPAP therapy. When using CPAP, a mouthpiece worn by the sleeper is connected to a machine that supplies a continuous stream of air that helps to keep the airway open and unobstructed during sleep. Often patients have concerns about discomfort, but they also sometimes harbor self-consciousness and concern about the CPAP device interfering with their sex lives and intimacy with partners. New research <a href= http://www.chestnet.org/News/Press-Releases/2014/10/Study-shows-CPAP-use-for-sleep-apnea-does-not-negatively-impact-sexual-quality-of-life  target= _hplink >provides evidence</a> to dispel the notion that CPAP has a negative effect on sex lives. Researchers at Illinois' Rosalind Franklin University examined sexual quality of life among CPAP users, and found no negative impact on sexual satisfaction among people who used CPAP on a regular basis. When used consistently as directed, CPAP is highly effective at improving sleep apnea. When CPAP is used regularly, it also leads to improvements in erectile dysfunction. <br /> <br /> So, let's review: Obstructive sleep apnea interferes with sexual function, may diminish fertility, and is associated with a long list of other serious health problems. Treating OSA with CPAP is safe, effective -- and doesn't make you any less sexy or sexually satisfied. I'd say there's a clear winner here. <br /> <br /> Sweet Dreams, <br /> <br /> Michael J.

"5 Life Lessons I Learned From Cancer"	"According to the American Cancer Society, the <a href= http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@research/documents/webcontent/acspc-042151.pdf  target= _hplink >statistics</a> are startling. Cancer is claiming more and more lives every day. The numbers tell us that over 1.6 million people will have been diagnosed by the end of 2014 -- a diagnosis that can rock the foundation of anyone's world. <br /> <br /> In November 1999, that's what it felt like for me and my husband when he was diagnosed with stage IV cancer -- Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. At one point, we asked the oncologist what we could do to help support the hospital treatments and aid in the fight against cancer.  Nothing,  he said. I'm sure it's not too hard to imagine how devastating an answer like that was. The diagnosis itself had been enough to knock the wind out of us. We went from being shocked, to afraid, to desperate to take action in repeated loops again and again. <br /> <br /> It's been a long journey, but cancer has proven to be a patient teacher that will 'gift' you with a wealth of lessons if your mind, heart, and soul are open enough to receive them. Here are the lessons I particularly learned in its classroom: <br /> <br /> <strong>1) Know When To Fight</strong><br /> As aforementioned, my husband's oncologist insisted there was nothing we could do to supplement the chemo treatments. I don't know if this is simply something those in the medical profession are required to say for fear of being held liable for suggesting alternative routes, but I do know that plenty of people take such words at face value and remain discouraged. My husband and I, however, decided we'd take a different approach. Despite how disheartened we felt, we chose to believe we could impact the cancer in our own way.<br /> <br /> So we hit the books, the internet, and the research papers and we also spoke with anyone who'd survived cancer. We wanted to know what they ate, what they drank, how they exercised, how they'd changed their life.  We made a commitment to let the doctors fight the cancer with the best science out there while we would fight the cancer with food, fitness, and faith.  It paid off. It's been 15 years, and the cancer has never once returned. <br /> <br /> <strong>2) Know When To Let Go</strong><br /> Of course, there were times when we  had to learn to let go as well. It was extremely disempowering to watch Jim deal with the fear and exhaustion that comes with cancer. I remember nights when I used to cry and pray over him while he slept. He handled the treatment so well and had such a positive attitude throughout it all but even so, it was a challenge to see my strong, muscular husband with the  chemo look. <br /> <br /> Still, I had to realize that there were things I simply couldn't do for him. For one, I couldn't take the cancer away from him nor could I take the chemo treatments for him. So I had to learn to accept the turn life had taken and work with it instead of struggle against it. <br /> <br /> It wasn't easy but the more we surrendered, the easier it was to maintain our peace of mind and let go of the overwhelm.  It was liberating. Once we stopped trying to control everything and just accepted that certain things were outside of our control, we could breathe easier and focus more on simply being present in life. <br /> <br /> <strong>3) Embrace The Support Of Others</strong><br /> There's a saying that goes  hard times reveal true friends  and we certainly found this to be the case during our journey with cancer. We had wonderful support from family and friends and we leaned on these people regularly. As long as Jim felt well, we kept our social life active and intact. <br /> <br /> We knew it was important to stay connected with our loved ones and allow them to nourish us whenever we felt depleted. So often, people go through life wanting to shoulder burdens for themselves but at the end of the day, you only end up physically spent, emotionally exhausted, and mentally taxed. It's imperative to allow people to help you and to allow yourself to be helped. <br /> <br /> But the journey was not without surprises along the way. A few people who we expected to be there for us weren't; and people we never expected to be there were. Cancer has a way of teaching you who your true friends are -- the ones who will be beside you through thick and thin, through up's and down's, through the beauty and the ugliness. Keep those friends close once their faithfulness is revealed through the fire of your trials. They are the ones who will help you build a life of unconditional love. <br /> <br /> <strong>4) Celebrate Life</strong><br /> <br /> Anyone who's walked 'through the valley of the shadow of death' can attest to the way you celebrate life once the storm has passed. With every sunrise and sunset; with every bird song and rainfall; with every blossoming flower in the spring and every fallen leaf in the autumn--we celebrate all the little notes that compose life's great symphony. <br /> <br /> We take the time to breathe in the fresh air. We take the time to savor the sweetness of fresh fruits. We laugh, we play, and we spend time with loved ones. As ironic as it may sound, seeing the face of death caused us to live life with even more passion. <br /> <br /> <strong>5) Know Miracles Can Happen</strong><br /> <br /> The doctors had encouraged my husband to bank his sperm, as it wouldn't be possible for us to conceive children once his treatments began and even after they finished. At the time, we were simply focused on fighting the cancer and ensuring that Jim was at his healthiest. As it turned out, that's all we needed to focus on, too. <br /> <br /> Years later, when the cancer was long gone, we became the proud parents to our beautiful son Matthew. Matthew is our little miracle. He's a reminder of the importance of gratitude. Life gives and takes away, but in spite of it all, we count our blessings. We know what's behind us, and we're stronger for it. We live in constant gratitude, hearts brimming with love and thankfulness because no matter where we find ourselves, no matter our present situation, no matter the trials before us...we're here, we're alive, we're together...and we can make it through. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <em>Suzanne loves to interact with her readers and writes more about healthy living, life after cancer, and cancer prevention at her <a href= http://www.vibrantlifeaftercancer.com/  target= _hplink >website</a>. </em> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 11:22:36 -0500"	"healthy"
"What Being a Vegan Runner Means to Me"	"It takes only one word, really: this lifestyle, to me, is a <em>practice</em>.<br /> <br /> I use the word in the way it's commonly employed in the context of meditation, yoga, philosophy, or even religion -- where  practice  means an activity done for its own sake, something that is not at first pleasurable (and in fact is often quite difficult) but that is unquestionably worthwhile for the foundation of character that it builds. Worthwhile, ultimately, because it purifies the soul.<br /> <br /> Many runners run for the joy of running. Many vegans, since coming to this diet, have discovered a love for food and cooking they didn't know existed. But neither of these describes me.<!--more--><br /> <br /> For me, both running and veganism involve personal sacrifices -- sacrifices that are worth it, but sacrifices nonetheless.<br /> <br /> I don't run in order to feel good in the moment. Sure, I recognize that if I'm having a bad day, a run might help me put things in context, and feel better all around. But that's not why I run -- in simplest terms, I run because running is the least painful way for me to stay in shape. There's some fun associated with it, but it must be qualified:  fun,  with quotes.<br /> <br /> There's more to it, of course. Over time, I've come to love the process of training for a certain time goal, or a distance that at one time seemed impossible. But in the moment when I'm spending a Saturday morning running 24 miles -- not in a race, just in training -- while the rest of the world enjoys their coffee and a crossword puzzle, I can't honestly say I'm having fun. Not even fun-in-quotes.<br /> <br /> My experience with veganism is very similar. Before I made the decision to stop eating meat, I loved cooking and looked forward every night to an adventure in the kitchen. I loved the act of going to the store, choosing the freshest ingredients to make the most authentic, luxurious version possible of whatever food I had chosen -- usually an Italian dish, ever since a trip to Italy awoke the chef (and wine lover) in me.<br /> <br /> But after I made the decision to eliminate meat and eventually any other animal products, cooking ceased to be my passion. I still enjoy making a good meal, but gourmet vegan cooking has never excited me the way more traditional cuisine did. I've accepted that for my palate, plants just don't taste as good as animal products did, and more than five years after I last took a bite of meat, I still recognize this. Now that I'm vegan, the love of cooking I once had is all but gone.<br /> <br /> If this is surprising coming from a guy who makes a living writing a blog about the intersection of veganism and running, that's because it's supposed to be. But if the story ended here, I wouldn't be writing this essay.<br /> <br /> Here's the rest of it: If in the moment neither running nor being vegan is as pleasurable as the alternative, then whatever drives me to run and abstain from all animal products, day in and day out, must be pretty darn compelling. And it is.<br /> <br /> Let's return to that word: practice. It implies a sacrifice, not in return for something external, but in exchange for something far more valuable -- inner strength.<br /> <br /> When I train for seven years to qualify for the Boston Marathon, taking 100 minutes off my marathon time in the process, what does that teach me about my own capacity for change? And about the power of small, repeated actions, each with no noticeable benefit, until the tiny improvements over the course of years culminate in a result that was unthinkable before?<br /> <br /> When I run 100 miles in just over a day, pushing on through the depths of pain and self-doubt, what do I learn about perseverance? About what we're really capable of, when we stretch ourselves to the limit, which is far more than we could have imagined?<br /> <br /> As for veganism: for years, there was an obvious inconsistency in my relationship with my food. When I looked into the eyes of my dogs, when I truly felt love for these animals. So how could I routinely begin my <em>pasta al arrabiata</em> by frying a half pound of flesh from an animal no less intelligent or sentient than my pooches? It didn't compute, so I didn't allow myself to think about it. I buried the thought deep in my psyche -- out of sight, out of mind, but always there, an open loop.<br /> <br /> When I finally made the decision to go vegan, that loop finally closed. During my first shopping trip as a vegan, I stood in the aisles of the grocery store diligently scanning ingredient lists, and was struck by the realization that this inconvenience felt incredibly, unmistakably right. At last.<br /> <br /> With each meal and each day that passes -- as any desire to eat animals ever again fades, and I begin to take a bizarre pleasure in the mild inconveniences that result from the choice to eat this way (having to prepare hummus wraps before a long car trip if we want to eat anything of substance, for example) -- a feeling of completeness grows inside me. My values and behavior are aligned rather than at odds. And that, for me, far outweighs whatever momentary pleasure I give up when I choose to eat lentils and rice instead of rosemary-rubbed steak and mashed potatoes.<br /> <br /> There are many people in this world who don't know that human beings can run 26.2 miles -- let alone 100 miles or more -- without stopping. Likewise, there are many who don't understand that it's possible to eat a healthy, substantial diet that includes no animal products whatsoever.<br /> <br /> On its own, either of these practices would be enough to create an identity -- <em>I'm a runner</em>, or <em>I'm a vegan</em>. Being both puts you squarely in the realm of  <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matt-frazier/weird-vegan-diet_b_3906979.html >freak</a>  in many people's eyes.<br /> <br /> Those of us who do it tend to believe that the diet helps our running. But there's still the inconvenience -- that of getting enough calories to support this type of training, with foods that in general aren't as calorically dense as meat or dairy products are. And the slight annoyance that at the aid stations of an ultramarathon -- those oases of food and drink that punctuate long, lonely stretches of trail -- the sandwiches, wraps, and cookies there usually aren't for us. Almost nothing is. And at the finish, the pizza with cheese and soup with chicken broth aren't for us either.<br /> <br /> This isn't a complaint. I don't expect special treatment. It's part of the practice of being a vegan athlete, one more tiny sacrifice to strengthen me.<br /> <br /> When I think of the word practice, it comes with an undercurrent of simplicity. The Zen monk needs no tools to meditate, only a cushion on which to sit. The yogi needs only her mat. There is as little obstruction as possible between the experience of the practice and he or she who practices.<br /> <br /> It's for this innate simplicity that I choose running as my sport. There's no two-thousand dollar bike to buy and maintain, no monthly membership fee, no hours at which the roads open and close. The dress is minimal -- shorts and a t-shirt suffice, and in the past few years we've seen even shoes become optional, as runners return to the form of running we were born to do. Sure, you can get as 21st-century as you want, with GPS devices, heart rate monitors, sensors in your shoes, and of course iPods and watches, but none of these is necessary. The longer I run, the less I find myself interested in the gadgetry.<br /> <br /> My veganism is no different. I flirted at first with gourmet vegetarian and vegan cooking, in an attempt to transfer my enthusiasm for omnivorous cuisine to my newly compassionate diet. But quickly I found that, for me, it didn't take -- I could only rarely get excited about vegan food the way I once did over long-simmered lamb ragout served over gnocchi with pecorino cheese.<br /> <br /> And so, because I was committed for ethical reasons not to eat animals, I went in the opposite direction. For lack of a better term, I turned to what Italian chefs affectionately call peasant food.<br /> <br /> Simple, one-pot, one-bowl meals, like rice and lentils, or  a grain, a green, and a bean.  Fancier, more processed snacks have been replaced by handfuls of nuts or raw trail mix, or some homemade hummus in a pita with a few spinach leaves. Fresh, raw fruit, and even plain, crispy vegetables -- it's amazing how your palate starts to change, and how amazing previously-bland foods start to taste once you get away from food that comes in packages.<br /> <br /> And in simplifying my approach to food, I discovered a different aspect of cooking than I used to appreciate: the joy of cooking a meal that, instead of highlighting three or four or twelve flashy ingredients, showcases just one profoundly delicious, in-season food in all its glory, against a simple backdrop of supporting flavors. Butternut squash risotto. Fresh tomato soup. Spinach curry. Or my favorite, <em>penne</em> with cauliflower, a dish which prompted chef Mario Batali to perfectly say,  Sometimes a recipe can be so simple it seems, well, almost pathetic. But eating something that's all about one simple, amazing flavor is what good food is all about. <br /> <br /> Luxury can take two forms -- big, extravagant, and over the top, or humble, minimalist, and just perfect that way. I'm learning that for me, the latter is the luxury that life as a vegan runner offers.<br /> <br /> Just as there are runners who live to run, there are vegans who love every aspect of being a vegan. They're eager to share the joy they've discovered, and perhaps that's why we've earned the reputation as a group that isn't shy about letting others know we love this lifestyle and wish they'd try it, too.<br /> <br /> But it has never been my shtick to tell people how they should eat, nor if I'm honest can I say that there haven't been aspects of being a vegan (or being a runner, for that matter) that represent sacrifices, or at least a delay of gratification, when compared to the life that most people choose. And that, of course, is why I chose the word practice, instead of delight or joy or hobby.<br /> <br /> I'm different from most other vegan runners in my personal experience with this lifestyle, but recognizing the sometimes-inconvenience and discomfort leaves me no less passionate about the choice. For me, the best way (the only way) to spread this message is to openly admit that it's <em>not</em> a walk in the park -- and to choose to do it nonetheless.

"6 Things Obituaries Can Teach Us About Living Better"	"To many, obituaries might seem a sad business to be in, but nothing could be further from the truth for the people who write them.  I never mention how people die,  said Anne Wroe, who has written obituaries for The Economist, <a href= http://thehairpin.com/2014/06/an-interview-with-ann-wroe-obituaries-writer-for-the-economist  target= _hplink >in an interview with The Hairpin.</a>  Because I don't think that's important at all. I think an obituary is a celebration of a life. <br /> <br /> And within those printed  celebrations  are many common themes and lessons that can serve as inspiration for the rest of us -- about what truly matters and how we can make the most of the time we have left.<br /> <br />  People have a primal fear of death, but 98 percent of the obit has nothing to do with death, but with life,  Margalit Fox, a writer with The New York Times <a href= http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2014/09/23/the-art-of-the-obituary-an-interview-with-margalit-fox/  target= _hplink >told The Paris Review</a> last fall. <br /> <br />  We like to say it's the jolliest department in the paper,  she said. <strong>With that in mind, here are a few lessons obituaries can teach the rest of us about living better:</strong><br /> <br /> <big><strong>1. Don't wait.</strong></big><br /> <br /> <img alt= travel  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2355206/thumbs/r-TRAVEL-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> Bryan Marquard, who has written obituaries for The Boston Globe, <a href= http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/gallery/Life_Lessons?pg=7  target= _hplink >wrote a post on the many lessons he's learned</a> in the course of writing about the lives of 800 people -- and one of those lessons is as simple as it is urgent: act now. <br /> <br />  Because I think about death a lot, I realized last year that if I live exactly as long as my father, I have 25 years left. That epiphany, along with other factors, led me to move from Greater Boston to a small town in Vermont,  <a href= http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/gallery/Life_Lessons?pg=7  target= _hplink >Marquard wrote</a>.  It's a long commute to the Globe, but I love where I live. Take it from an obituary writer: Don't put off what you've always wanted to do. <br /> <br /> <big><strong>2. Humor <em>always</em> has a place.</strong></big><br /> <br /> <img alt= man laughing  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2355196/thumbs/r-MAN-LAUGHING-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> Occasionally, obituaries can be laugh-out-loud, reminding readers that humor and laughter are cherished commodities (with <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/22/laughter-and-memory_n_5192086.html  target= _hplink >serious health benefits</a>). They are often what people remember most about a person.<br /> <br />  You never want to make fun of anyone, but you do want to appreciate eccentricities, record unusual events and relay humorous incidents or comments,  Bruce Weber, who has written obituaries for The New York Times, <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/business/media/22askthetimes.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&  target= _hplink >said in a 2008 Q&A. </a> Take the example of <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/07/grandparents-day-2013_n_3887074.html  target= _hplink >this popular 2013 obituary for Mary Agnes Mullaney</a>, known to friends and family as  Pink,  which celebrated the many humorous lessons she imparted.  Never throw away old pantyhose. Use the old ones to tie gutters, child-proof cabinets, tie toilet flappers, or hang Christmas ornaments,  it said.  Do the Jumble every morning. <br /> <br /> <big><strong>3. Be bold. </strong></big><br /> <br /> <img alt= surfing  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2355174/thumbs/r-SURFING-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> Obituary writer Laura Huber wrote about the things she's learned in <a href= http://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2013/08/41383/column-writing-obituaries-is-a-lesson-in-life/  target= _hplink >a 2013 column for The Suffolk Times</a>, and one of her primary messages is to  live a life worth writing about. <br /> <br />  I've written and read about people who sailed around the world, served in wars, taught children to read or took care of their grandchildren,  <a href= http://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2013/08/41383/column-writing-obituaries-is-a-lesson-in-life/  target= _hplink >she said</a>. Whatever your passion, she continued, embrace it wholeheartedly, no matter what others think.<br /> <br />  If you love to write, start a blog.

If you love car racing, get on the track. You are more than the desk you sit behind or the children you birthed. Live passionately, at least a little bit, every day. <br /> <br /> <big><strong>4. Be thankful.</strong></big><br /> <br /> <img alt= grateful  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2355064/thumbs/r-GRATEFUL-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> When Death With Dignity advocate Brittany Maynard died in the fall of this year, her family released <a href= https://www.compassionandchoices.org/2014/11/02/brittany-maynard-passes-gently-at-her-portland-home/  target= _hplink >an  official  obituary that included a final message from the 29-year-old</a>, and that centered on one thing: gratitude.<br /> <br />  In this final message, she wanted to express a note of deep thanks to all her beautiful, smart, wonderful, supportive friends whom she 'sought out like water' during her life and illness for insight, support and the shared experience of a beautiful life,  the obituary stated. It ended with the following quote from Maynard herself: “It is people who pause to appreciate life and give thanks who are happiest. <br /> <br /> <big><strong>5. Remember, everyone's human.</strong></big><br /> <br /> <img alt= couple argument  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2358112/thumbs/r-COUPLE-ARGUMENT-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> While obituaries cannot always paint a complete picture of an entire life, they can remind us that everyone -- no matter how famous or beloved -- is fallible, and that's okay.  Obituaries in The Times frequently refer to fiery tempers, marital infidelities, crimes committed -- things that can be attested to in interviews or documented by news accounts or other sources,  <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/business/media/22askthetimes.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0  target= _hplink >Weber said in his New York Times Q&A</a>.<br /> <br /> Bob Chaundy, who has worked as an obituaries editor at the BBC for nearly two decades,  <a href= http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-obituaries-writer-a-matter-of-life-and-death-8895052.html  target= _hplink >wrote in The Independent:</a>  If I find enough people saying a person had a particularly violent temper or could not suffer fools gladly, then I would include these frailties in order to make them appear more human. <br /> <br /> <big><strong>6. Put relationships first.</strong></big><br /> <br /> <img alt= father laughing  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2355164/thumbs/r-FATHER-LAUGHING-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> While <a href= http://www.aarp.org/home-family/friends-family/info-04-2012/do-it-yourself-obituary.html  target= _hplink >some people opt to write their own obituaries</a> or even pay a professional obituary writer to do it for them, remembrances are most often written by friends and family or -- in the case of well-known individuals -- a staff writer for a given publication. Meaning that the story told not only hinges on how others remember an individual ( This is my chance to be on the phone, talking to family and friends, capturing that person,  <a href= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/offering-the-last-word-on-obituaries/  target= _hplink >longtime obituary writer Kay Powell told CBS News</a>), but that those memories often center on how he or she made others feel.<br /> <br />  Be nice,  <a href= http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/gallery/Life_Lessons?pg=2  target= _hplink >The Globe's Marquard wrote</a>.

"Research Links Addictive Social Media Behavior With Substance Abuse"	"Plenty of research has demonstrated that the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-judson-brewer/social-media-addiction_b_4079697.html  target= _hplink >addictive quality of social media</a> is very real. And according to a new study, heavy social media use may also contribute to a different type of addiction. <br /> <br /> Psychologists at the University of Albany found that not only is social media (particularly Facebook) itself potentially addictive, those who use it may also be at greater risk for impulse-control issues like substance abuse. <br /> <br /> The researchers surveyed 253 undergraduate students, asking questions about their social media use, Internet addiction, emotion regulation and alcohol use. They found that roughly 10 percent of users experience  disordered social media use,  meaning that they exhibit addictive behaviors in the way they use platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. To assess disordered social media use, the researchers included questions that reflected modified diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, such as,  How good does Facebook make you feel?  and  Do you check Facebook first thing when you wake up in the morning?  <br /> <br /> Those who were struggling with social media addiction were more likely to report Internet addiction (as measured by scores on the <a href= http://netaddiction.com/internet-addiction-test/  target= _hplink >Young Internet Addiction Test</a>), challenges with emotion regulation (such as poor impulse control), and drinking problems. <br /> <br /> Psychologist Julia Hormes, who led the study, said that Facebook was found to have especially addictive properties. The respondents spent an average of one-third of their online browsing time on Facebook, and 67 percent received Facebook push notifications on their phones.  <br /> <br />  New notifications or the latest content on your newsfeed acts as a reward. Not being able to predict when new content is posted encourages us to check back frequently,  <a href= http://www.albany.edu/news/56604.php  target= _hplink >Hormes said in a statement</a>.  This uncertainty about when a new reward is available is known as a 'variable interval schedule of reinforcement' and is highly effective in establishing habitual behaviors that are resistant to extinction. Facebook is also making it easy for users to continuously be connected to its platform, for example by offering push notifications to mobile devices. <br /> <br /> The researchers hypothesize that disordered social media use is likely a symptom of poor emotion regulation skills, which heightens susceptibility to a variety of types of addiction. <br /> <br /> “Our findings suggest that disordered online social networking may arise as part of a cluster of risk factors that increase susceptibility to both substance and non-substance addictions,” <a href= http://www.albany.edu/news/56604.php  target= _hplink >Hormes said</a>. <br /> <br /> The new findings join a growing body of research investigating the addictive potential of Internet social media use. MRI data has shown that the brains of compulsive Internet users to <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/30/shocking-ways-internet-rewires-brain_n_4136942.html  target= _hplink >exhibit similar changes </a>to those seen in people with alcohol and drug addictions. Harvard <a href= http://www.pnas.org/content/109/21/8038.abstract  target= _hplink >research conducted in 2012</a> provided some insight into why using Facebook in particular seems to be so highly addictive. Disclosing information about ourselves, the researchers found, is intrinsically rewarding. It activates the Nucleas Accumbens, a brain area that also lights up when cocaine or other drugs are ingested. But it's not just posting on Facebook that's addictive -- it's also receiving all those likes and comments. Another study found that receiving <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-judson-brewer/social-media-addiction_b_4079697.html  target= _hplink >positive feedback about ourselves</a> also activates the brain's reward centers. <br /> <br /> However, Hormes' and other research can't be taken as conclusive evidence that disordered social media use constitutes a full-blown addiction. <br /> <br />  The question of whether or not disordered online social networking use can be considered a 'true' addiction is a tough one,  Hormes said in an email to the Huffington Post.  I think the answer really depends on your definition of 'addiction.' Many people think of addictions as involving ingested substances. However, if we think about addiction more broadly as involving some kind of reward then it is easier to see how behaviors may be addictive. <br /> <br /> The new findings were published in the December issue of the journal <em>Addiction</em>.

"Spike in Tiny Number of Gay Men on PrEP Abandoning Condoms Hardly Represents 'All' Gay Men"	"<a href= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2014/12/hiv-aids-prep-truvada-condom-gilead-gild.html?s=print  target= _hplink >A Dec. 8 blog post in the <em>San Francisco Business Times</em></a> has sparked another furor over gay men using the HIV drug Truvada to prevent infection with the deadly virus.  San Francisco men shed condoms in favor of Gilead's HIV prevention pill,  alleges the title of <em>SFBT</em> reporter Ron Leuty's opinion piece.<br /> <br /> Leuty reported on a survey of men in a Kaiser Permanente AIDS-prevention program. More than 500 are taking Truvada once a day as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Leuty called the 45-percent increase among men in the study not using condoms  eye-popping  -- which it is. Clearly these men aren't heeding the <a href= http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/guidelines/PrEPguidelines2014.pdf  target= _hplink >Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation</a> to use condoms in addition to taking the drug.<br /> <br /> But it's a serious stretch to project the behavior of about 90 men on PrEP in this one study to  all  gay men in San Francisco, let alone anywhere else. Consider this: All 500 men in the study represent only about 0.007861 of San Francisco's roughly 60,000 or so gay and bisexual men.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there will always be men who push the limits of risk to engage in high-risk sex that is, for them, something of value. Others of us may see it as self-harm, but these guys usually describe it in terms of intimacy and pleasure. Either way, we should be glad these men are making even a partial effort to protect themselves by taking PrEP.<br /> <br /> We can argue all we want about whether PrEP provides cover for dangerous behavior. But we aren't addressing the most important questions: Why do some gay men value high-risk sex more highly than they apparently value their own health? Why do some guys seem unable to value themselves apart from their willingness to engage in  anything goes  sex?<br /> <br /> At risk of getting stuck trying to understand what even mental-health experts would likely classify as aberrant behavior, I would suggest we step back to get a more accurate picture of how the vast majority of gay men conduct their sex lives. Reframe the statistics that can be blown out of proportion to make it look like  all  gay men have stopped using condoms, or even like  all  gay men engage in anal intercourse, which they don't.<br /> <br /> Ron Stall, Director of the LGBT Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh, has identified four interconnected  epidemics  of psychosocial health conditions that disproportionately afflict gay and bisexual men, each one making the other worse: childhood sexual abuse, partner violence, depression, and drug use. Together, their insidious effects are referred to as syndemics. Men who are most strongly affected by any one of these tend to be at high risk for HIV and substance abuse. Those from lower-income or culturally marginalized ethnic groups are especially vulnerable to syndemic effects.<br /> <br /> In <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12773359  target= _hplink >one study</a>, Stall and his colleagues found that 11 percent of 812 men who reported one problem -- depression, for instance -- had engaged in high-risk sex. Of 129 men who reported three or four problems, 23 percent said they had had high-risk sex.<br /> <br /> The numbers are high relative to the so-called general population. But surely no one can be surprised to see self-destructive behavior in people treated as if they don't deserve better. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the numbers tell us something quite astonishing when we look at them from a different angle: that 89 percent of the men reporting one problem did <em>not</em> engage in high-risk sex. Likewise, more than three quarters of the men with three or four problems did <em>not</em> engage in high-risk sex.<br /> <br /> These numbers make it clear: The overwhelming majority of gay men are resilient and take care of, protect, and value ourselves. How can this be? In the face of overwhelming pressures and struggles that can give gay men all the reasons we might need to harm or medicate ourselves, how is it that most of us <em>don't</em>?<br /> <br /> The short answer: We accept ourselves. Research suggests that our journey toward being resilient gay men who accept and value ourselves begins by accepting our sexual orientation -- overcoming our own self-stigma, what we've internalized from the bullies of our lives. Ron Stall told me in an <a href= http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/02/the-power-of-choosing-resilience/273245/?single_page=true  target= _hplink >interview for <em>The Atlantic</em></a>,  Guys who do the best job of resolving internalized homophobia [or self-stigma] are the least likely to have current victimization, substance abuse, and compulsive [high-risk] sex. <br /> <br /> Put a little differently, he said,  Getting a population of people to not hate themselves is good for their health. This is not rocket science.  Building up, and upon, gay men's resilience is a challenge for each of us -- and for our families, lawmakers, ministers, teachers, and anyone else who wishes us to be well and fully contributing members of society. <br /> <br /> The place to start is in revising the way we think. We need to consider carefully how numbers can hurt us when they are taken out of context. Their  eye-popping  shock value dwindles when they're put into perspective against the bigger number of  all  gay men.<br /> <br /> We can hope that gay men who value condomless sex more than they do their own lives will eventually find intimacy and pleasure in sex built upon mutual respect and protection. Until then, PrEP for them is an important step in protecting themselves.<br /> <br /> In the meantime, the vast majority of gay men -- who don't abuse drugs or engage in high-risk sex -- clearly value their health enough not to endanger themselves or their partners.<br /> <br /> Yes it's shocking to realize that <a href= http://sfaf.org/hiv-info/statistics/  target= _hplink >one in four gay men in San Francisco is HIV-positive</a>. <br /> <br /> But it's at least as surprising that 75 percent of gay men in San Francisco are not HIV-positive. What can we learn from them about how they have avoided HIV when the virus is so prevalent in the community? What can their experience show us that might even help the guys taking an expensive, powerful, and toxic drug so they can engage in high-risk sex?<br /> <br /> Among the lessons, one stands out: Just as the way we frame our personal story can make us feel like a victim of our circumstances or a victor over them, so too the way we present statistics  can mean the difference between hope and despair. Increases in condomless sex among a tiny sliver of men already at extreme risk for HIV may be  eye-popping.  But so is the far greater number of gay men who choose to view safer sex as the key to real intimacy and pleasure between men who care about themselves and one another.

"Today's Patience Is Tomorrow's Possibility"	"Patience is not an entity in and of itself, but is a process, the act of learning to embrace a state of mind.  It's something that must be practiced, embodied, and given room to grow. <br /> <br /> I must have patience for today, for the days ahead, and a steadfast appreciation for days past and how they have molded me. I would be foolish to tell all of you that I haven't had moments this week when I've lost sight of myself and felt a complete wreck: distraught with emotion for the future and the life I called my own a mere few weeks ago. The devastation that cystic fibrosis has caused in just a short time is unfathomable. I feel as if I have whiplash. cystic fibrosis is not only getting a grasp on my lungs, but my mind as well.  I am so used to making plans for tomorrow, cramming as much life into every minute of every day, and living in overdrive.  I am having to retrain my mind as much as my body.  Most of all though, I am having to embrace patience.<br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-IMG_20141202_113606.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-IMG_20141202_113606.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-IMG_20141202_113606-thumb.jpg  width= 250  height= 250  /></a></center><br /> <br /> <strong>Small Victories</strong><br /> I must embody patience for what today brings, and patience in knowing tomorrow is a new day filled with new possibility. It may look different than I so desperately want it to, but every ounce of progress and growth is something worth celebrating. Each day holds its own victory, no matter the size.  The smallest of good and progress overcomes any adversity. The smallest of victories may be paired with the greatest patience, but in the face of this battle against cystic fibrosis any progress is a tremendous victory filled with possibility.<br /> <br /> Today was filled with beautiful victories.  For the first time in weeks I can catch a glimpse of myself when I look in the mirror.  For the first time I feel somewhat like  me.   For the first time in weeks I do not completely fear this body which encapsulates my soul and mind.  I do not dread or fear looking in the mirror and seeing what stares back at me. For the first time in over a week, I recognize myself. Part of it might be my body and mind adjusting somewhat to the current mood of my lungs and life, but for sure what I see is the reflection of love, support, and unfathomable kindness I've been shown by the medical team here and the all wonderful support I've been given outside these walls.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Hope</strong><br /> Yesterday, my lungs showed us all some signs of improvement. My lungs and body have a long way to go, but it's progress. After days and days of decline and not recognizing the person from within myself, having patience for today and hope in tomorrow's possibility have brought progress and small victories. This is going to be a long road, and there will be tough decisions and days ahead, but I am learning to dwell in patience and remain grateful for the beautiful journey that is my life. Most of all, grateful for each wonderful person and experience whose path I have the privilege to cross. As long as there is hope in tomorrow and I have patience in today, cystic fibrosis will never be victorious. <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-IMG_20141129_123305.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-IMG_20141129_123305.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-IMG_20141129_123305-thumb.jpg  width= 300  height= 300  /></a></center><br /> <br /> I am so thankful for every person that is on this journey with me.

I shook my head and blinked my eyes to make sure that what I was seeing was real, to make sure that it wasn't a trick of the light, that I wasn't mistaken. I flexed my fingers on the steering wheel to make sure the hands on it were actually attached to my arms.<br /> <br /> Raised veins snaked across the back of my outstretched hands. Sharp lines defined them instead of soft angles. There were age spots where there was once clearly smooth flesh. Wrinkles framed the knuckles, not gently contoured skin. How could these belong to me? These are the hands of an old woman!<br /> <br /> This truth widened up from my tailbone, skittered down my back and fingered across my shoulders. My going-grey hair lifted at the back of my neck as full awareness shot through me and I splayed my fingers in a gut-sigh of surprise. These <em> are</em> my hands! This isn't a concept. This isn't a spiritual axiom. This isn't me being centered and oh-so-wonderful in the face of my culture telling me my body is too old.<br /> <br /> A few months before, a man had called me  wrinkly  and I thought I'd weathered this transitioning of me towards <em> old</em>. I'd written about it in an article called  <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robin-korth/sex-over-50_b_5563576.html  target= _hplink >My 'Naked' Truth</a>  and I'd received accolades and anger for talking about standing naked in front of a mirror honoring my aging body. This was different. This was way different.<br /> <br /> This was me being totally <em>inside</em> the shifting of my years. This was bloody and raw reality pouring through me at the level of my DNA. I had become someone else while I wasn't looking. It was as if a little kid in the grocery store was pointing at me and asking,  Mommy, what's wrong with that lady? Why does she look that way?  And there I sat in the car and I cried. This is it. This is  <em>my</em> life -- and so very, very much of it is gone.<br /> <br /> A voice in my head laughed wickedly as it sneered,  Did you really think you were going to get away with this so easily? Did you really think you were done with this aging thing? How arrogant of you! How foolish of you!  As my tears welled and rolled, all I could think of was how very innocent I had been. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to do this third age of my life -- these years between middle-age and old. I don't have a roadmap for what lies before me. I'm not some airbrushed and face-lifted women happily hawking anti-aging cream.  Noticeable difference in as little as three weeks!  I'm a child of the 1960s and 70s where rock and roll was my birthright. I was going to change the world and the  Age of Aquarius  meant I would be forever young. I felt cheated and somehow betrayed. This wasn't supposed to happen to me. But it has.  My hands are telling me that my youth is done. I've become the grey-haired lady in the drug store. <br /> <br /> As I head into my 60th birthday, a whole new feeling about myself is emerging. Everything that I thought was valid and settled is now up for grabs. I don't want to be doing the same things I was doing a year ago or five years ago. I want to misbehave. I want to kick this thing called  my life  and rock it wide open. I want to dance it and question it. There is an aching need for me to tear it all apart and look at the pieces -- where have I been, what have I done and where am I going now? Where is the meaning and power, the potency, joy, laughter and wonder of my life? <br /> <br /> I'm on my way to a place I've never really thought much about. Wait, to be really honest, I never thought about it at all! I wasn't planning on getting old. Do any of us? But into my future I must go. So, with my heart open and my spirit very curious, I am walking full-wide and brave into this next great adventure of my life. I'm walking into the hands of time.<br /> <br /> <em><a href= http://www.robininyourface.com/the-hands-of-time/  target= _hplink >Robin Korth: The Hands of Time</a><br /> <br /> Robin Korth enjoys interactions with her readers.

"Practicing Mindfulness"	"What are you thinking about? You've probably been asked this question before, but how often do you consciously think about your thoughts on your own? You may find the question irritating, nosy, or out-of-the-blue so much so that you tend to provide the autopilot response of  nothing.  If you have feelings of anxiety, fear, stress, or sleeplessness, ask yourself again: What is it that you are thinking about? If you can't pin it down to just one thought in one moment, consider fine tuning your focus. <strong>This practice of thinking in the moment of your exact thoughts is called mindfulness and has been shown to help <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23527522  target= _hplink >lower stress levels</a> in daily life.</strong><br /> <br /> I was introduced to the University of Pennsylvania's mindfulness program through my company, who presents the opportunity to a few employees each semester with the goal of reducing stress. The program has taught over <a href= http://www.pennmedicine.org/mindfulness/about-us/  target= _hplink >10,000 participants </a>to manage difficulty and stress, reduce depression and anxiety, cope with trauma and loss, increase focus and mental clarity, improve communication in relationships, and find purpose, meaning, and beauty in life. What peaked my interest, selfishly, was the reported number of performance benefits ranging from improved decision making, better attention in meetings, decreased stress and anxiety, increased self-awareness, and overall emotional well-being (Jon Kabat-Zinn, <a href= http://www.amazon.com/Full-Catastrophe-Living-Wisdom-Illness/dp/0739358588  target= _hplink ><em>Full Catastrophe Living</em></a>). <br /> <br /> After participating in the eight-week mindfulness program, I feel more prepared to navigate through an over-scheduled, technology-driven, media-saturated, endlessly complex society. Bringing awareness to my day has allowed me to make more conscious decisions.<strong> Every action we take comes as a result of a decision to take action.</strong> From waking up and getting out of bed in the morning to leaving work in the evening, and finally to turning off at night and going to sleep, each action in your day deserves attention and should align to your intentions.<br /> <br /> <blockquote>The decisions you make should be part of your life, even at the micro level. </blockquote><br />  <br /> I'll warn you that practicing mindfulness sounds easier than it really is. At the beginning of the course, I became easily frustrated by the concept of taking time away from my so-called detrimental distractions and spending that same time on the  nothing  (breathing, meditating, and feeling). Leaving behind my cell phone, work assignments, and social life for a set period of time each day was crucial to the meditation practice that was a key component of the program. Meditation has been shown to be beneficial both <a href= http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858  target= _hplink >physically and emotionally</a>. Buying into the idea of leaving life for a few minutes each day was made easier to understand with the book <a href= http://www.amazon.com/Full-Catastrophe-Living-Wisdom-Illness/dp/0385303122  target= _hplink ><em>Full Catastrophe Living</em> by Jon Kabat-Zinn</a> that the class used as an anchor to key lessons. Zinn helped me realize, in my own time, that what I was looking for  well-being, inner balance, and peacefulness exist outside of time  and by committing to a meditation practice, you can find those moments every day and avoid becoming a victim of time.<br /> <br /> As a type-A competitive, hurried, easily irritated, and impatient individual, one of the most meaningful takeaways the mindfulness practice taught me was to  <strong>stop </strong>(whatever I was doing or thinking), <strong>breathe </strong>(1, 5, or 20 breaths at whatever pace I needed), and  <strong>be </strong>(re-opening myself to the present situation). This concept of awareness in how I was responding to the world around me was extremely powerful. It allowed me to see how reckless I was being with my time. Mindfulness taught me to check in with my thoughts constantly by pulling my attention to the current focus.<br /> <br /> It seems most honest people acknowledge that their thoughts regularly wander. We advance through life ignoring the most appropriately present thoughts by distracting ourselves with thoughts of the list of things we need to check off, what we're making for dinner, Facebook updates, or exactly how we're going to meet that deadline. Although we may feel that we have control over the time we spend thinking about these things, we end up using these distractions as an indulgence to escape from the current moment. Then, we feel frustrated when we don't know where the time has gone. Our time has been spent without meaning or focus.<br />  <br /> First, it is important to understand when you lose your focus. Then, transition from noticing those moments to reestablishing your intention. Remembering whatever it was you wanted to set your focus on like the person talking in front of your or the paragraph in the book you're reading.<br /> In week five of the mindfulness course, I decided to treat myself to a lazy Sunday by selecting one of my free on-demand movie options. I was aware that when I chose the movie About Time, I was not engaging in a mindful activity. Quite the opposite -- I was intentionally distracting myself and avoiding my to-do list. Unexpectedly, <em>About Time</em> provided an opportunity to reflect on the Penn mindfulness course.<br /> <br /> In the movie, the men of the Lake Family have a special gift: the ability to travel in time. This supernatural ability comes to an end for the father (played by Bill Nighy) when we find out he is going to die. Before he passes, he provides his son with his secret formula for happiness. After living through one full day, he says,  live every day again almost exactly the same as the first time (with all the tensions and worries that stop us from noticing how sweet the world can be) but the second time, noticing.  Noticing is the exact premise of the mindfulness course. As I watched life play out over again, I was struck by how incredibly and unexpectedly emotional I became in how powerfully the mindfulness lessons hit me. Watching the characters go through life with the same annoyances that I feel on a daily basis like sitting next to someone whose headphones are on for the world to hear or demand the barista speed up in getting your coffee made me think twice about my practice. When I realized the opportunity we all have to live life with a different perspective, my perception of the world was transformed and I became excitedly more grateful for everyday experiences.<br /> <br /> By taking in each joy and pain as it happens, and just being with each moment, you learn to be mindful of every aspect of your life from something as dull as your commute to something as exciting as your wedding day. With the help of technology, we have gotten very good at multi-tasking. In tuning into the entertainment industry or social media, we steer ourselves away from the present. I'm guilty of it -- taking a snapchat at a sporting event, tweeting from a concert, uploading a picture to Instagram mid-run! If you have ever done any of these things, I will challenge you to start living in the moment. <strong>Slow down.</strong> <em>Be present</em>. Connect with nature and those around you. Listen more carefully. Allow your mind and body to react. At the very least mindfulness tells us to reflect on pervasive entertainment and social media consumption and start using our time to just be. Start today, in this moment, by being mindful with only one thought at a time. Ask yourself,  What am I thinking about?  but this time, answer honestly.<br /> <br /> <em>This post was originally published on  <strong><a href= http://www.quarterforyourcrisis.com/  target= _hplink >Quarter For Your Crisis</a></strong>, an online community created to share stories of those who don't think normalcy is an option and who want to actually live and breathe their passions.</em> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 18:41:11 -0500"	"healthy"
"Are You Being Too Assertive? Not Enough?"	"Many people want to be more assertive in the workplace. Being assertive can help you voice your opinions to your coworkers, help you negotiate that promotion and pay raise, and also has a number of health benefits.<br /> <br /> According to the <a href= http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/assertive/art-20044644  target= _hplink >Mayo Clinic, assertive behavior and communication can help with stress management and improve your coping skills.</a> As the Mayo Clinic explains, being assertive shows that you respect yourself and you are willing to stand up and express your thoughts and feelings. It boosts your self-confidence and can improve your work satisfaction.<br /> <br /> Many people want to be more assertive but suffer from being too passive, abandoning their good ideas or not voicing their opinions to avoid conflict with others.<br /> <br /> In addition to the problem of being too passive, there is also the issue that others face of being overly assertive in the workplace. Just as passivity can have repercussions to being successful at work, so too can not knowing the right amount of assertiveness to employ.<br /> <br /> In a <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17279851  target= _hplink >series of studies published in 2007 </a> by Daniel Ames, a professor at Columbia Business School, and Francis Flynn, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, research showed that what makes a good leader is the right amount of assertiveness.<br /> <br /> The scientists asked workers their views of colleagues' leadership strengths and weaknesses. The research showed that the most common weakness described was the coworker's assertiveness. Half of the comments pointed to an issue with too much assertiveness and the other half described too little.<br /> <br />  Assertiveness dominated reports of leadership weaknesses, though it wasn't nearly as common in colleagues' comments about strengths,  said Ames.  When leaders get assertiveness wrong, it's glaring and obvious, but when they get it right it seems to disappear. <br /> <br /> Ames compares the right amount of assertiveness at work to the right amount of salt in a dish.  When there's too much or too little, it's hard to notice anything else, but when it's just right, you notice the other flavors,  said Ames.<br /> <br /> But just how hard is it to get the right amount? That perfect level of assertiveness. As the science shows, it is much harder than we might think.<br /> <br /> In a new study conducted by Ames with fellow researcher Abbie Wazlawek, a doctoral student at Columbia Business School, there is one major problem standing in the way of workers finding that right level of assertiveness. That obstacle is their own self-awareness.<br /> <br /> Unlike a chef who can tell if she under seasoned or over salted a dish, many people are absolutely oblivious to how assertive they come across to colleagues.<br /> <br /> In the <a href= http://psp.sagepub.com/content/40/6/775  target= _hplink >study published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em></a> in June of this year, researchers found that there is a huge disconnect between how assertive someone thinks they are and how assertive their colleagues view them to be.<br /> <br /> The investigators conducted a series of four studies to test the connection (or dis-connection) between assertiveness and self-awareness. Three of the four studies involved mock negotiations with MBA students enrolled in a negotiation course at Columbia Business School, and the fourth study was an online survey of 500 US adults.<br /> <br /> In the first three studies, the MBA students were paired up to do a mock negotiation over licensing rights, after which each participant answered questions about their own assertiveness and the assertiveness of their counterpart. The negotiators were also asked to guess what their counterpart said about their assertiveness.<br /> <br /> The results of the studies showed a major disconnect between people's self-awareness of their assertiveness and what others thought of them:<br /> <br /> <ul><li>57 percent of people who were viewed by their counterparts as being under-assertive thought that they were the right level of assertiveness or even too assertive.</li><br /> <li>56 percent of people who were viewed as being over-assertive by their counterpart thought they came across as appropriately assertive or even under-assertive.</li></ul><br /> <br /> The results indicate that at work many people worry that they are coming across as a jerk, fearing that they are too assertive when their colleagues believe, in fact, that they are not assertive enough. Then there are the employees that are seen as jerks by their coworkers because they are being too pushy, when they judge their actions as reflecting the right level of assertiveness.<br /> <br /> The study also showed that many people who were getting assertiveness right actually mistakenly viewed themselves as pushing too hard and felt that they had crossed a line during negotiation. As Ames and Wazlawek explained, those who mistakenly thought that they transgressed this line attempted to make up for their over assertiveness and agreed to less desired terms in an attempt to smooth things over.<br /> <br /> All of this research indicates that getting to that perfect level of assertiveness is definitely important to a successful and satisfying career and that one of the biggest barriers is the individual's own self-awareness. <br /> <br /> Most employees are just unsure about how assertive they are actually coming across. But the research strongly suggests that if you want to season your behavior with just the right amount of assertiveness, you can't rely on your own palate, it is important to let others taste test your behavior.<br /> <br /> As Ames explains,  We often find that students and executive are unaware of how other people see their behavior. One reason is because people typically don't get candid feedback on things like assertiveness.  But this poses problems as Ames adds,  Who wants to tell the overbearing boss that he or she is a jerk? <br /> <br /> <em><a href= http://adoreedurayappah.com/  target= _hplink >Adoree Durayappah-Harrison</a> is a graduate of three masters programs, one in Applied Positive Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania researching character strengths, goal achievement, and human flourishing; another from Harvard University studying Buddhist practices of the cultivation of both body and mind; and the third, an M.B.A. from Pepperdine University.

"3 Things You Do That Make You Frustrated and Unhappy"	"This morning you laughed and yesterday you cried, but that's how it goes, right? Ups and downs, smiles and frowns, welcome to the roller coaster called life. <br /> <br /> But how well are you handling the twists and turns? What brings you up and what takes you down? Most importantly, what role do you play in your emotional demise? <br /> <br /> Sometimes the biggest culprit of your unhappiness is you.  If you're ready to get real and make major changes in your life, check out these three common, but crazy things you do that keep you frustrated and unhappy.<br /> <br /> <strong>1.  You Graciously Accept Drama.</strong><br /> <br /> When was the last time you got angry, just because someone got angry at you? How many times have you stressed out over what someone said or what someone did?<br /> <br /> Routinely allowing others to frustrate you is not only unwise, it's dysfunctional. It's like sending out an invitation, inviting  drama into your life. One thing I have learned is when drama knocks, don't answer.  Don't let it sit on your coach, lay in your bed or talk on your phone. Don't let it break you down, contaminate your joy or disrupt your life. <br /> <br /> Protect your peace.  We lock doors to protect our homes. We have alarms to protect our cars. We even use passwords to protect our phones. Yet, do we protect our peace? Often times we don't and therefore, whoever and whatever wreaks havoc on our bliss. But when you reject foolishness and abandon chaos, happiness thrives.<br /> <br /> <strong>2.  You Abuse Yourself.</strong><br /> <br /> I know -- abuse sounds ugly, and perhaps grotesque, yet many of us engage in it everyday. Believe it or not, the average person is in an abusive relationship with themselves and don't even know it.<br /> <br /> The inability to say no, living without discipline, accepting mistreatment, posting selfies for attention (constantly), unhealthy eating, the inability to be alone and living beneath your potential are all forms of abuse. It's a form of self-bullying that breeds unhappiness and frustration. <br /> <br /> One of the most powerful things you can do is shift from self sabotage to self love. Love every roll, wrinkle and spot. Love what you have and love what you don't. Find gratitude in the most challenging times and watch your life dramatically improve.<br /> <br /> <strong>3.  You Marry Intention and Divorce Action.</strong><br /> <br /> Is this you? Are you always talking the talk but not walking the walk? <br /> <br /> Intention oriented people already have New Year's resolutions dancing in their head. They have big changes to make and lots of goals to achieve. Their outlook for 2015 is fabulous and grand. A <a href= http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/01/01/just-8-of-people-achieve-their-new-years-resolutions-heres-how-they-did-it/  target= _hplink ><strong>study in <em>Forbes</em></strong></a> revealed 40 percent of Americans make New Years resolutions, but only 8 percent achieve them. <br /> <br /> Why? Most people are stuck in the cycle of intention. They intend to do things but they never actually do. The problem is intention without action yields nothing. When your intention is not in alignment with action, frustration occurs. It's hard to be happy when you constantly seek goals but don't reach them. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and commit to following though. Write that book. Start your business. Put down the fork and pick up the weights. Whatever you want, go get it.  Divorce intention and commit to action. I'm a firm believer that taking action every day keeps the sadness away.<br /> <br /> <strong>Rewriting Your Script...You Deserve It</strong><br /> <br /> No matter what, you deserve to be happy and live a joy filled life.  Now is the time to commit to choices that build you up, versus tear you down. Smile bigger, laugh harder and take your power back. Are you ready to do it? <br /> <br /> Start by eliminating the crazy things you do that make you frustrated and unhappy. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 18:31:37 -0500"	"healthy"

" Ascension  Is a December Rarity; It Doesn't Have a Christmas Theme"	"TV Review                                                               Jackie K Cooper<br />                                                        Ascension  (Syfy)<br /> <br />  Ascension  is a new mini-series on the Syfy Channel that shows a lot of promise. It is a story about a manned spaceship on a one hundred year journey to a new planet, that is also a murder mystery. Both facets of the show are interesting and so you get the best of both worlds. Whether or not you want to devote three nights to it is up to the individual viewer, but it moves quickly and the story is intriguing.<br /> <br /> When the show starts the ship has been in route to the new planet for fifty-one years. People on board the ship have adjusted to the life they have to lead for the most part. However all is not perfect and in the very opening scenes a murder is committed. A young woman is shot and killed. The Captain (Brian Van Holt) wants to keep the murder a secret and say she died accidentally.<br /> <br /> He assigns his First Officer, Aaron Gault (Brandon P Bell), to investigate. One of the mysteries of the mystery is how did anyone get their hands on a gun, as the ship is supposedly weapons free. In a short time Gault has a full list of suspects but no conclusive killer.<br /> <br /> At the end of the first night's episode some startling information is revealed that makes  Ascension  a story with a twist. I didn't see it coming and that is always a good thing when a show is trying to entertain me.<br /> <br /> The main negative is that no one in the cast particularly stands out. The acting ranges from interesting - Tricia Helfer as the Captain's wife - to abysmal - Van Holt. Just about everyone else falls into the okay range in the middle. One actor who does draw interest is Brad Carter. He plays the  butcher  who lives in the lower levels of the ship. He is a dangerous individual who was involved with Lorelei (Amanda Thompson), the murdered woman.<br /> <br /> There are enough twists and turns to keep the plot moving, and the idea of having six hundred people contained on a spaceship with a mission to keep humanity alive is a good one. The murder investigation keeps this from just being a space adventure, and the surprise twist I mentioned is a good one.<br /> <br /> December is a time when there are many reruns on the major networks. A new mini-series from Syfy is just what Santa needed to bring. It will be a perfect show to watch as the weather turns cold so mark it down on your viewing calendar.<br /> <br />  Ascension  airs December 15, 16 and 17 at 9PM on the Syfy Channel.<br />                    <br />                                                                                                                                Jackie K Cooper<br />             <a href= http://www.jackiekcooper.com ; target= _hplink >www.jackiekcooper.com</a> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 23:05:22 -0500"	"entertainment"
"Side Show's Sad Demise"	"That Side Show will close its run at the St. James Theater on Broadway is sad news. After an ebullient first preview in late October, the revival had a meet & greet at Sardi's. Many of the show's producers had not yet met the musical's stars, Erin Davie and Emily Padgett as the Hilton sisters, conjoined twins, whose pioneering showbiz story is retold, Matthew Hydzik and Ryan Silverman as the men/promoters in their lives, and David St. Louis as their loving caretaker. They also had not yet met director Bill Condon, who took a controversial piece about unusual acts (eh, freaks) in the age of burlesque and vaudeville, revised it from Bill Russell's original book, amplifying the twins' backstory, and made it soar. Henry Krieger's music, especially  I Will Never Leave You  was always great. Rising to its Dreamgirls moment, this show was making the producers very happy. <br /> <br /> Be careful not to call them  Siamese.  The Hilton sisters, Daisy and Violet were joined at the pelvis and were among the very few conjoined twins to survive birth. As it was, when the option to separate occurred, they demurred knowing that one or both could die. As Side Show recreates their world, their lives are difficult;  freaks,  they are also sweet and pretty young blonds, finding love difficult. In a lively production number/ dream sequence, they imagine life apart. <br /> <br /> Sardi's was packed that night. Many well-wishers took Isaiah Johnson for David St. Louis, the actor for whom he understudies. Johnson took it in stride. He and Delaney Westfall who understudies for each of the twins were happy to be part of the production, said to be timely because Netflix' American Horror Story was making freak shows a trend. Cinderella star Laura Osnes could not wait to meet Davie and Padgett. Tommy Tune held court at a window table, awaiting his not yet scheduled return to the Café Carlyle.<br /> <br /> Bill Condon, aware of the controversy surrounding Side Show in its original production -- is it P.C. to focus on  freaks -- said he is hoping for the day when reviews won't open with a comparison to its ill-fated first production. And now this production is meeting an ill fate all its own.<br /> <br /> <em>A version of this post also appears on <a href= http://www.gossipcentral.com/  target= _hplink >Gossip Central</a>.</em> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 17:35:38 -0500"	"entertainment"

"Sony Hackers Stole Script From New James Bond Film"	"<br>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Early villains have emerged in the next James Bond film  SPECTRE : hackers who stole a version of the screenplay as part of a devastating cyberattack on Sony Pictures.</br>               <br>Producers of the James Bond films said they learned on Saturday morning that an early version of the  SPECTRE  script was among material stolen and made public by hackers who infiltrated computers at the Sony studio.</br>               <br> Eon Productions is concerned that third parties who have received the stolen screenplay may seek to publish it or its contents,  Eon said in a statement, while warning that the script is protected by U.K. copyright laws. </br>               <br> SPECTRE,  starring Daniel Craig as 007, is set for release on Nov. 6, 2015. Filming began this month after producer Barbara Broccoli and director Sam Mendes unveiled the title, cast and new car, but little about the plot.</br>               <br> I was so excited to tell this story but to explain why, I would have to tell you the plot and I can't do that,  said Mendes at the presentation in England, a reminder of Sony's might in the movie world. </br>               <br>The Bond franchise is one of the most lucrative for Sony Pictures and the last installment  Skyfall  brought in $1.1 billion worldwide, more than any other Bond film.</br>               <br>A Sony spokesman said news reports that the cyberattack forced the studio to stop production on films, including  SPECTRE,  were wrong.</br>               <br> Productions are still moving forward,  Robert Lawson told Reuters. </br>               <br>Hackers launched an attack on the Sony Corp. entertainment arm on Nov. 24, disabling the computer network and stealing and leaking a trove of sensitive information in the most severe cyberattack on a company on U.S. soil.

"New J.K. Rowling Story Reveals The History Of The Leaky Cauldron"	"J.K. Rowling posted a new riddle on Harry Potter fan site Pottermore today -- part of a 12-day series during which new writings and magical tidbits will be released as the ultimate Christmas gift for wizard-loving muggles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Here's today's quiz:</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt= pottermore  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388746/thumbs/o-POTTERMORE-570.jpg?2  /><br /> <br /> The answer, as Hogwarts fanatics know, is Diagon Alley, the bustling street where Harry first picks up his school supplies and wand. Rowling rewarded those who responded correctly with further details about the Leaky Cauldron, the famous pub that serves as a gateway to Diagon Alley, including the names of a few of its former owners. <br /> <br /> Today's prize was a two-for-one: Rowling also shared an anecdote about Florean Fortescue, a Diagon ice cream shop owner who was originally slated to play a bigger part in the Harry Potter series. <br /> <br /> While some fans delight in such details, others think that Rowling let readers take over the Potter narrative <a href= http://thoughtcatalog.com/nico-lang/2013/09/why-j-k-rowling-needs-to-let-harry-potter-go/  target= _hplink >rather than meddling with the concluded plot</a>.<br /> <br /> If you're in the first camp, check out these stories J.K.

"Christian Bale Reveals The Truth About The 'Dark Knight Rises' Ending"	"There's a storm coming to the Internet, Mr. Wayne, and it's all your fault.<br /> <br /> Christian Bale is apparently on a one-man mission to destroy the Web nowadays. The actor recently admitted he felt jealous about <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/24/christian-bale-jealous-ben-affleck-batman_n_6211190.html  target= _hplink >Ben Affleck</a> taking over as Batman, revealing he was <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/03/christian-bale-batman_n_6262216.html  target= _hplink >never even asked to return</a> to the part. The latest bomb came when Bale gave his opinion on the ending of  <a href= https://soundcloud.com/ewradio/christian-bale-interprets-the-ending-of-the-dark-knight-rises  target= _hplink >The Dark Knight Rises</a>.  <br /> <br /> In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Bale revealed that he believes the ending of the movie was no dream. It really happened.<br /> <br /> The scene in question shows <a href= http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/dark-knight-rises-ending-explained  target= _hplink >Alfred</a> spotting Bruce Wayne with Selina Kyle at a cafe. They acknowledge each other, and Alfred leaves.<br /> <br /> Because this is a Christopher Nolan movie and he's known for some great ambiguous endings (<a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Qp5osoH8s  target= _hplink >Can someone just pick up that top already?</a>), there has been a lot of <a href= http://www.filmending.com/2012/07/the-dark-knight-rises-ending-dream.html  target= _hplink >speculation</a> that this sequence of events only happens in Alfred's head. This is partly because Alfred describes a similar scene to Wayne earlier in the film and partly because everyone thought Batman had been blown up by a nuclear bomb. <br /> <br /> <iframe width= 570  height= 321  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/nvtJ_XC2bz8  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe><br /> <br />  My personal opinion is that no, it was not a dream, that that was for real,  Bale told EW.

"Sandy Hook Anniversary Vigils Shine Light On A Nation Plagued By Gun Violence"	"This Sunday marks two years since 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, before turning his gun on himself. For the loved ones of gun violence victims across America, the anniversary of the tragedy serves as a grim reminder of how little has changed since then.<br /> <br /> On Thursday evening, dozens of family members grieving the loss of relatives who died in shootings, along with advocates for stricter gun laws, gathered at Roosevelt University in Chicago for a vigil memorializing both the Sandy Hook victims and victims of gun violence in their own city. The Cook County medical examiner’s office <a href= http://homicides.suntimes.com/2014/12/01/police-murders-increased-in-november-but-remain-down-for-2014/  target= _hplink >has reported 406 homicides</a>, many of them due to shootings, in Chicago this year.<br /> <br /> Speaking before the packed room, Beti Guevara, who teaches science classes at the Barreto Boys & Girls Club in the city’s Humboldt Park neighborhood, said she keeps five bullet casings she found on the sidewalk one day while walking around her community as a daily reminder of the importance of her work.<br /> <br /> <img alt= victims vigil chicago  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386764/thumbs/o-VICTIMS-VIGIL-CHICAGO-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><em>Participants in a Chicago vigil brought photographs of the loved ones they were remembering.</em></center><br /> <br /> When she asks students in her classes to raise their hands if they know somebody who has been shot, she said, on most days all the hands go up.<br /> <br /> “These are babies, but they’ve lost their fathers, their mothers, their sisters and their brothers,” Guevara told The Huffington Post. “When somebody gets killed through gun violence, there’s a ripple effect and that ripple effect is on the family -- but they don’t report on the news about it afterwards. After they bury the child, then where’s everybody?”<br /> <br /> Guevara can personally attest to this “ripple effect” -- her brother was gunned down when she was 12 years old, and she saw firsthand the effect his death had on her parents. She says she wishes that more protests, like the ones that have taken place in response to the grand jury decisions about Michael Brown's and Eric Garner’s deaths, would focus specifically on gun violence.<br /> <br /> “We’re going down the streets of Chicago with our rage and we’re blocking traffic,  Guevara said.  And yet we lost so many babies last week, and nobody is getting outraged and nobody’s stopping traffic.”<br /> <br /> Rafael Burgos came to the vigil to remember his 18-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who was shot and killed in October. She was picking up her brother from a friend's home, and  <a href= http://www.myfoxchicago.com/story/26825917/stray-bullet-enters-apartment-striking-and-killing-18-year-old-woman  target= _hplink >died instantly when bullets came through the window</a> of the house.<br /> <br /> Alexandra was “a good girl, never in any trouble never in any gangs of any kind,  Rafael told HuffPost.  She was a good, loving young lady. She was a very positive role model for many people.” The teenager was attending college and wanted to become a social worker some day.<br /> <br /> “It just feels like an emptiness,” Rafael said, describing life without his daughter. “Every day you wake up and it feels like there is a part of you missing, because there is. And it’s like you walk and you function and you want to participate in life and it’s like you feel like a shadow.”<br /> <br /> <img alt= rafael chicago vigil  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385376/thumbs/o-RAFAEL-CHICAGO-VIGIL-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><em>Less than two months ago, Rafael Burgos' daughter was fatally shot in Chicago. He said the shooting has made him  feel like a shadow  of his former self in his day-to-day life.</em></center><br /> <br /> Rafael added that the shooting also particularly impacted his younger son, who witnessed the tragedy.<br /> <br /> “My son struggles every day. He tries to go through the motions but he’s hurting, we’re all hurting,” Rafael said. “He’s trying to be strong for us.”<br /> <br /> Sharon Gardner, a mother of six, came to the vigil in honor of her brother, who she said served in the military in Operation Desert Storm. He was fatally shot in 1994, only six months after he returned to Chicago.<br /> <br /> “I just feel so cheated, so cheated,” Gardner told HuffPost. “He survived all that war and turmoil overseas -- then he wasn’t here with us more than six months in his hometown.”<br /> <br /> Gardner said she fears for her children, especially her 15-year-old son.<br /> <br /> “I pay life insurance [for him] before I pay my rent now,” she said.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sharon chicago vigil  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385368/thumbs/o-SHARON-CHICAGO-VIGIL-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><em>Sharon Gardner's brother was fatally shot 20 years ago. She says she still prays for him daily.</em></center><br /> <br /> Participants in the vigil walked two blocks to Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park and released 26 white balloons into the air in memory of the 26 people who died in the Sandy Hook shooting, along with an additional balloon that represented victims of gun violence in Chicago.<br /> <br /> At Washington, D.C.'s National Cathedral on Thursday, hundreds of mourners and activists took part in a two-hour vigil, including Gilles and Joyce Rousseau, whose daughter Lauren was a Sandy Hook teacher. The attendees used the service as an opportunity to recommit themselves to ending what speakers called  the nation's epidemic of gun violence.  Despite the vigil's hallowed location beneath the sweeping stone arches of the cathedral nave, the event felt less like a memorial service and more like a very polite rally aimed at calling supporters to action.<br /> <br /> In his remarks, the Right Rev. Gary R. Hall, dean of the National Cathedral, described an epic battle between  the gun lobby,  exemplified by the National Rifle Association, and what he called  the cross lobby,   the hundreds of congregations across the country taking  faithful action to prevent gun violence. <br /> <br />  The gun lobby is no match for the cross lobby,  Hall told the attendees.  In the end, we will prevail in this struggle because love and justice always finally win over fear and hate. Let us commit ourselves, today, to stand where God calls us to stand: with and for those who suffer and die from the illegal and immoral use of firearms. <br />  <br /> While the date of the event and the green memorial ribbons given to guests were both reminders of Sandy Hook, attendees drew resolve and spirit from more recent events as well, like the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin and the recent fatal police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Speakers and attendees alike said they viewed all the victims as pieces of the same problem: senseless deaths by guns. <br /> <br /> The sentiment was similar on Friday in the Riverdale area of the Bronx, where members and staff of the Sisters of Charity bowed their heads in remembrance not only of those killed at Sandy Hook, but of all victims of gun violence across the world.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sisters  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387816/thumbs/o-SISTERS-900.jpg?5  /><br /> <em>Members of the Sisters of Charity in the Bronx dedicate a moment of silence to victims of gun violence.</em><br /> <br /> “Hold all those lives hurt and lost through violence in your heart -- both those who have inflicted violence and those who have endured it,” said Sister Karen Gray. “Perhaps you know someone whose life was lost to gun violence. Gently hold their presence in your imagination. <br /> <br /> After a brief pause, the sisters read aloud the names of people in their community who had been lost to gun violence. Sister Barbara Ann Ford, a Bronx native who was shot to death in 2001 in Guatemala after spending two decades doing relief work in the country, was one name. Archbishop Oscar Romero was another. <br /> <br /> Gray read aloud statistics about background checks for buying guns in the United States. Forty-nine percent fewer suicides with a gun in states where a background check is required for all handgun sales. Thirty-eight percent fewer women killed with a gun by an intimate partner. Thirty-nine percent fewer police officers murdered with a handgun that was not their own. And so on. <br /> <br /> “God of life, every act of violence in our world, in our communities, between myself and others, destroys a part of your creation,” Gray said to close the service. “Stir in my heart a renewed sense of reverence for all life. Give me the vision to recognize your spirit in every human being, however they behave towards me. Make possible the impossible by cultivating in me the fertile seed of healing love. May I play my part in breaking the cycle of violence by realizing that peace begins with me.” <br /> <br /> At a church in the quiet suburb of Oak Park, Michigan, a group of 40 people assembled on Thursday to discuss the problem of gun violence in the nation and particularly in their state, whether in nearby Detroit or in a small town.<br /> <br /> Linda Brundage, the Michigan chapter leader of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, spoke at length about gun control and the need for stronger background check laws.<br /> <br /> “Stop being the silent majority,” she told attendees gathered at Our Mother of Perpetual Help Parish. “We must find our voices to change the gun culture in the United States.”<br /> <br /> The group held candles in a circle as they recited name after name, memorializing loved ones lost to gun violence.<br /> <br /> Cassandra Davis of Redford, Michigan, spoke to the crowd about her son Jeremiah, who was shot to death in November of last year by a 15-year-old. Jeremiah was 11.<br /> <br /> “I didn’t even allow my son to play with a gun,  Davis said.  He never owned own a toy gun. <br /> <br /> <img alt= cassandra davis  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387536/thumbs/o-CASSANDRA-DAVIS-900.jpg?6  /><br /> <center><em>Cassandra Davis lost her 11-year-old son, Jeremiah, to gun violence last year.</em></center><br /> <br /> According to news reports, the teen who shot Jeremiah was <a href= http://downriversundaytimes.com/2014/03/23/teen-sentenced-for-manslaughter/ >playing with a gun</a> that is believed to have been found at his grandmother’s house. The two boys were at Jeremiah’s father’s home in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn Heights, and Jeremiah’s father and the 15-year-old’s mother were both in the house when the shooting took place. The teen, whose name has not been released because he is a minor, later pleaded guilty to manslaughter.<br /> <br /> Davis said Thursday’s gathering was the first time she had been able to talk about her son at length in public. But she has become close with some of the women at Moms Demand Action and may continue to tell her story, in part to push for gun control laws to be strengthened and for gun safety to become a stronger priority, particularly in families with children.<br /> <br />  I protected my son as much as I could -- as a mom, as a parent,  she said.  He couldn’t ride his bike from one corner to the other [without me] standing there watching him. I didn’t let him go around the block. He’s like, ‘Mom, why can’t I go around the block and so-and-so did?’ Because I said so. I’m protecting you, it’s my job. I said, ‘Well, when you get to be 12 years old you can go around the block.’ He didn't make it.”<br /> <br /> Darrell and Katherine Lotharp brought their daughter, Starletta, to Thursday’s gathering. Starletta was eight months pregnant in the spring of 2002 when her partner, Michael Brown Sr., was shot and killed by a neighbor.<br /> <br /> “Unfortunately this neighbor was a convicted felon that had just got out of prison,” Darrell Lotharp said. “So what does he do? Get into an argument with a citizen, and he goes and pulls the gun out and shoots him. For nothing. They arrest him within 24 hours and he's right back in jail. It disrupted a whole family, over nothing, and that’s sad. There’s no rhyme or reason for it.”<br /> <br /> <img alt= lotharps  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387548/thumbs/o-LOTHARPS-900.jpg?4  /><br /> <em>Darrell and Katherine Lotharp with their daughter, Starletta, whose partner was shot to death when she was eight months pregnant.</em><br /> <br /> Starletta gave birth four days after the funeral.<br /> <br /> “He never saw his daughter. Things like that, that hurts,” her father continued. “If he didn’t have a weapon, I don’t think it would have happened. But he had easy access to a gun. What’s a felon doing with a gun?”<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Davis told attendees there are still countless things she can’t bring herself to do in her son’s absence: Go in his room. Watch University of Michigan football games. Eat pizza or macaroni and cheese. Walk at a favorite park. Watch the news.<br /> <br /> “I still can’t get over it. I wake up every morning saying I can’t believe my baby’s gone,” she said. “I kept my son in a good neighborhood, a good school district. It doesn’t matter where you’re at -- people have guns everywhere. <br /> <br /> <em>Christina Wilkie reported from Washington, D.C., Christopher Mathias reported from New York, Joseph Erbentraut reported from Chicago and Kate Abbey-Lambertz reported from Detroit.</em> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 00:05:14 -0500"	"crime"
"These Powerful Signs Illustrate The True Diversity Of The #BlackLivesMatter Movement"	"In the months since unarmed teenager Michael Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, this past August, an ever-growing movement spotlighting police brutality and the structural racism in American society has taken the country by storm.<br /> <br /> On Saturday, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/13/millions-march-nyc_n_6320348.html?1418511000  target= _hplink >thousands of people marched through New York City</a> to honor the lives of Brown, Eric Garner, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice and the other unarmed people of color who lost their lives at the hands of police officers.

We don't have a policing problem here. If what was happening in the black community was happening in the white community, we would have a policing problem. But it's not. I would like the white people in America to understand that this cannot continue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <big><strong>Arlene Edwards, 25, Pennsylvania-based lab analyst</strong></big><br /> <br /> <img alt= arlene  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388954/thumbs/o-ARLENE-570.jpg?4  /><br /> <br />  Being an African-American woman, I feel the issue is deeper than racism.

"Effigies Of Blacks Found Hanging By Nooses At UC Berkeley"	"<p>BERKELEY, Calif.

The spokeswoman said the effigies appear to be connected to a noon-time demonstration nearby planned to coincide with a national protest against police brutality dubbed  #blacklivesmatters.  The effigies appear to be life-size photos of lynching victims. Two depicted men and third was a photograph of a female victim.</p><br />               <p>The effigies had names of lynching victims and the dates of their death. At least one effigy had  I Can't Breathe  printed on the front.

"More Ferguson Documents Released By St. Louis County Prosecutor"	"<p>A prosecutor released hundreds of pages of additional documents Saturday from the investigation into the police shooting of Michael Brown, including an interview transcript of a friend who initially asserted that he had seen Brown get shot in the back.</p><br />               <p>St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said the newly released records were inadvertently excluded from the thousands of pages of other documents made public Nov. 24, when a grand jury decided not to charge Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for killing Brown.</p><br />               <p>The freshly publicized documents include a transcript of an interview of Brown's friend Dorian Johnson conducted by the FBI and county police just four days after the Aug. 9 confrontation in which the white officer shot the black 18-year-old. Previously released forensic evidence showed that Brown was not shot in the back but was struck by bullets in the head, chest and arm.</p><br />               <p>Johnson's account to investigators was generally similar to his later grand jury testimony, in which he portrayed Wilson as the aggressor during a struggle that began at the officer's vehicle and led to a brief chase before Brown's fatal shooting.</p><br />               <p>In both his original interview and his Sept. 10 grand jury testimony, which was previously released, Johnson said that Wilson reached out of his vehicle window toward Brown's throat or shirt. During the ensuring struggle, Johnson said he never saw Brown touch Wilson's gun.</p><br />               <p>Wilson told grand jurors that Brown grabbed ahold of his weapon and twisted it toward the officer's leg. The officer eventually fired his gun from inside the vehicle. Forensic evidence showed that Brown's hand was shot at close range. Brown and Johnson then ran.</p><br />               <p>In his August interview, Johnson initially was adamant that he had seen Johnson get shot in the back while running.</p><br />               <p> It definitely struck him in his back,  Johnson said, later adding:  It caused him to stop. </p><br />               <p>Asked by a detective how he knew Brown had been shot in the back, Johnson replied:  If it would've missed him, or if he wouldn't have felt it, I believe he would've kept runnin. </p><br />               <p>Under further questioning, Johnson later acknowledged that he didn't see a bullet hit Brown's back, but he remained adamant that Brown's back was toward Wilson when he fired a shot.</p><br />               <p>By almost all witness accounts, Brown turned at some point to face the officer.</p><br />               <p>Johnson described Brown's hands as being raised, one higher than the other. Wilson told grand jurors that one of Brown's hands was clenched in a fist and the other at his waist as Brown began charging back at Wilson.</p><br />               <p>As with the previously released grand jury documents, the witness transcripts released Saturday varied in their accounts of Brown's hands. One witness said Brown's  hands kinda went up.  Another said Brown's hands were up briefly but he then ran toward Wilson. Another said Brown threw up his hands and said something that sounded like,  Don't kill me. </p><br />               <p>Among the documents released Saturday was a witness list, with all of the names of the witnesses whited out. It shows that 62 people testified before the grand jury between Aug. 20 and Nov. 21, including some who appeared multiple times. Some of the people interviewed by federal authorities did not testify before the grand jury.</p><br />               <p>McCulloch apologized in a written statement for any confusion that may have occurred by failing to initially release all of the interview transcripts. He said he believes he has now released all of the grand jury evidence, except for photos of Brown's body and anything that could lead to witnesses being identified.</p><br />               <p>___</p><br />               <p>Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.

"March In Washington Draws Thousands Of Protesters Demanding Justice For All"	"<img alt= dc  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388788/original.jpg  /><br /> <br /> At 10:30 a.m. on Saturday, hundreds of people began to gather at the Freedom Plaza in Washington D.C. By noon, the crowd had swelled to thousands. The protesters began marching through the nation's capital to call for justice and decry racial discrimination in light of recent deaths of black men at the hands of the  police. <br /> <br /> The crowd rallied through the city demanding  justice for all,  the slogan that lent the protest its name. The Justice For All march was a response to recent decisions by two separate grand juries in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, which declined to indict the white police officers responsible for the deaths of, respectively, 18-year-old Michael Brown and 43-year-old Eric Garner.<br /> <br /> The families of police shooting victims, including relatives of Brown, Garner, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/12/tamir-rice-death-homicide_n_6316104.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular  target= _hplink >Tamir Rice</a>, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/akai-gurley-vertical-patrols_n_6263202.html  target= _hplink >Akai Gurley</a> and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/12/john-crawford-family-marc_n_6314656.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices  target= _hplink >John Crawford</a>, led the march.  <br /> <br /> The demonstration was organized by the <a href= http://nationalactionnetwork.net/  target= _hplink >National Action Network</a>, a civil rights organization headed by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Sharpton joined the families as they marched through Washington Saturday.<br /> <br />  We are not anti-police; we are anti-police-brutality,  Sharpton told protesters.  And today we challenge Congress to follow in the president's footsteps and take legislative action to protect us, the citizens. <br /> <br />  Do not be silent. Do not be complacent. Do not continue to live with police misconduct and violence as somehow acceptable,  Sharpton urged earlier this week in <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-al-sharpton/marching-for-congressiona_b_6291638.html  target= _hplink >a piece he wrote for The Huffington Post. </a><br /> <br /> Trevon Ferguson, a 14-year-old from Long Beach, New York, said he had traveled about five hours to attend the march in D.C., and planned to head back with his family this afternoon. He said he has never had a problem with police officers, but constantly fears them. <br /> <br /> “Sometimes I feel like, you never know, I might be the next Trayvon Martin or the next Eric Garner. So who’s to say that a cop wouldn’t come and just shoot me and leave me in the street?” Ferguson told HuffPost. “So I’m here to make sure that me and my family are treated equally, just as any white boy or girl. Dr. King believed in equality, so I’m here for equality.”<br /> <br /> The mothers of Rice, Garner, Brown and Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was shot in 2012 by a neighborhood watch volunteer, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/12/mother-deceased-unarmed-black-men_n_6318494.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices  target= _hplink >appeared together in public for the first time Friday night</a>. In a joint interview on CNN, the women spoke out against racial discrimination and argued that their sons might not have died if they had been white.<br /> <br />  If Eric Garner was a white man in Suffolk County doing the same thing that he was doing -- even if he would have been caught selling cigarettes that day -- they would have given him a summons and he wouldn't have lost his life that day ... I believe that 100 percent,  <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/12/mother-deceased-unarmed-black-men_n_6318494.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices  target= _hplink >Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, told CNN's Anderson Cooper.</a> <br /> <br /> The deaths of these black men have become part of a narrative that many believe is all too common in the United States. <br /> <br />  We are together. We are united. We are standing. And we are going to fight this together,  Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, told the crowd before she began to lead the march.  You guys mean the world to us.  <br /> <br /> Garner's mother also approached the podium and praised the diversity of the crowd. <br /> <br />  Look at the masses,  she said.  Black, white, all races, all religions ... We need to stand like this at all times. <br /> <br /> In recent weeks, protesters around the country have participated in demonstrations to decry racial injustice and police brutality. <br /> <br /> Dion Anderson, a 42-year-old from Washington, D.C., said he “felt obligated” to come to the event because of his own negative experiences with police officers, especially growing up.<br /> <br />  When I was eight years old, we were at the basketball court playing basketball and a Prince George’s County police officer -- I’m tearing up right now thinking about it -- just came on the basketball court and flattened [the ball], and just left. For no reason. So that’s why I’m obligated to come down,” Anderson said. “I even got scars on the back of my head from Prince George’s County Police Department … So police brutality has been rampant in my life.”<br /> <br /> Many of the signs and chants from protests around the country have used the slogan that has become synonymous with the movement:  Black lives matter.  <br /> <br /> That same message was echoed by protesters who participated in the Justice For All march on Saturday.

"Man Suspected Of Fatally Shooting 2 Homeless, Hairstylist, Arrested"	"ATLANTA (AP) -- A suspect has been arrested and charged in the deaths of two homeless men shot as they slept on the streets of Atlanta and the separate slaying of a female hairstylist in the nearby city of Decatur, police said Friday.<br /> <br /> Aeman Lovel Presley has been arrested on two counts of murder for the Nov. 23 death of Dorian Jenkins and the Nov. 26 death of Tommy Mims, Atlanta Police Sgt. Greg Lyon said. Jail records do not list an attorney for Presley.<br /> <br /> Decatur Police Sgt. Jennifer Ross said later Friday that Presley, 34, also faces a murder charge in the Dec. 6 death of Karen Pearce.<br /> <br /> Pearce, 44, worked as a hairstylist, and police have said she was shot on a Saturday night after leaving a restaurant in downtown Decatur. Jenkins, 42, and Mims, 68, both were homeless and shot multiple times while wrapped in blankets and sleeping on the sidewalk, authorities have said.<br /> <br /> Presley was arrested at a rail station Thursday morning after an officer saw him pass through entry gates without paying a fare, Lyle Harris, chief spokesman for the Atlanta-area transit agency MARTA, said in a written statement Friday. He was carrying a loaded revolver and a box of ammunition, Harris said.<br /> <br /> All three agencies declined to release further details on the arrest because of the ongoing investigation.<br /> <br /> Atlanta police asked the public and law enforcement agencies nationwide for help with the seemingly random shootings of the homeless men this week, emphasizing the type of bullets used.<br /> <br /> Detective David Quinn told a news conference Wednesday that both men were shot repeatedly, using a type of .45-caliber bullet with an elongated shape often called a  cowboy bullet. <br /> <br /> Jenkins was shot five times and Mims was shot seven times, a frequency Quinn called  overkill. <br /> <br /> Homeless advocates warned their clients to be on guard as police investigated.

"Suspect In Oregon School Shooting Arrested"	"STEVEN DUBOIS, Associated Press<br /> <br /> <br /> PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Police in Portland have arrested a suspect in the shooting that injured three people outside an alternative high school.<br /> <br /> Authorities said they stopped a vehicle around 1:30 a.m. Saturday at North Interstate Avenue and Going Street and arrested a 22-year-old man. A handgun was found in the vehicle.<br /> <br /> Police were searching an apartment about half an hour later as part of the investigation. The apartment is about five blocks east of the shooting near Rosemary Anderson High School.<br /> <br /> Detectives are investigating and will release the suspect's name and charges after he is booked into the Multnomah County Jail.<br /> <br /> Witnesses told police there may have been a dispute outside the high school on Friday, just before the shooting occurred at a street corner.<br /> <br /> The assailant and two other people fled, and the wounded students went to the school for help, a police spokesman said. A 16-year-old girl was critically wounded while two males were hospitalized in fair condition. Another girl was grazed by a bullet.<br /> <br />  Based on the investigation thus far, the shooting appears to be gang-related,  Sgt. Pete Simpson said Friday night in a statement.<br /> <br /> Police gang investigators  feel comfortable saying this is a gang-related shooting based on some of the people involved,  Simpson added in an interview. Police said they believe the shooter has gang ties. Simpson declined to say which victims might be linked to gangs.<br /> <br /> The spokesman said police were still gathering details on the reported dispute.<br /> <br />  There was some kind of dispute between the shooter and some people,  Simpson said.  We don't know if it was (with) all the victims or one of the victims. <br /> <br /> The victims are students at the high school or in affiliated job training programs, police said.<br /> <br /> Police identified the hospitalized victims as Taylor Michelle Zimmers, 16, who was in critical condition; David Jackson-Liday, 20; and Labraye Franklin, 17.<br /> <br /> Olyvia Batson, also 17, was treated at the scene after a bullet grazed her foot.<br /> <br /> Sierra Smith, a 17-year-old student, told The Oregonian she saw one of the male victims being helped by a teacher inside the school.<br /> <br />  He was laying on the ground. He had blood coming out of his stomach,  she said.  It was scary. <br /> <br /> Another student, Oliviann Danley, 16, told the newspaper she saw a boy run into the school and yell,  Oh my God, did I just get shot? <br /> <br /> Rosemary Anderson High School serves at-risk students who were expelled or dropped out, or who are homeless or single parents. According to the school's website, 190 students annually are enrolled at the north Portland location. The school also has a second location in Gresham.<br /> <br /> Gang violence in Portland isn't a new phenomenon. Some of the violence occurs between rival gangs, but bystanders have also been hurt.<br /> <br />  We've made a lot of progress in addressing the gang problem, but we haven't eradicated it,  Mayor Charlie Hales said.  Today's really a sad reminder that it's still with us. <br /> <br /> Portland police have said they saw a spike in gang crime over the summer and have complained they don't have adequate resources to address the problem. Recent violence includes a man killed in a drive-by-shooting in June and another man killed in a separate shooting. A 5-year-old boy also was shot in the leg while playing at an apartment complex.<br /> <br /> A Multnomah County report on gang activity released in June said crime in the county that includes Portland actually decreased from 2005 to 2012. As inner-city Portland gentrifies, the report said, criminal activity is shifting from northern neighborhoods to areas farther east, including the city of Gresham.<br /> <br /> The north Portland neighborhood where the shooting occurred exemplifies the trend. Before Friday, the place once known for gangs had not had a shooting with injuries in nearly four years.<br /> <br />  It brings up a lot of old wounds,  Simpson said.<br /> <br /> Dani Gonzales, 64, has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years and said it's generally safe but there has always been some gang activity.<br /> <br />  Kids just get silly and get crazy ideas. I don't know what goes on in their heads,  Gonzales said.<br /> <br /> There was another school shooting in the Portland area in June, but it was not gang-related. A freshman killed another boy in a locker room, and a bullet grazed a teacher before the shooter went into a bathroom and died from a self-inflicted gunshot, police said.<br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Follow Steven DuBois at <a href= http://twitter.com/pdxdub  target= _hplink >http://twitter.com/pdxdub</a>.

"After Honoring Eric Garner, LeBron's Voice Could Have Been Louder"	"Last Saturday, during the Chicago Bulls' pregame warmup against the steaming-hot Golden State Warriors, Derrick Rose wore a T-shirt displaying the words  I Can't Breathe.  It was a reference to the recent non-indictment of a NYPD police officer in the choking death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, in Staten Island. Garner's last words were  I can't breathe. <br /> <br />  That night we talked about how we supported [Rose],  teammate Tim Flowers <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/sports/basketball/derrick-rose-sees-taking-a-stand-in-eric-garner-case-as-his-responsibility.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >told <em>The New York Times</em></a>. Rose and Flowers were childhood friends who grew up together on the South Side of Chicago. Flowers added that  wearing the shirt was an important thing to do,  calling it  a responsibility.  <br /> <br /> Rose's effort to bring awareness to the ongoing issue of unarmed black men dying at the hands of police officers trickled down to the rest of the league, with many players following suit over subsequent nights. Even Kobe Bryant, who is often ridiculed for not publicly stating his opinions on major issues, partook in the demonstration along with some of his Lakers teammates. <br /> <br /> But this is now LeBron James' league, and there isn't a name that permeates our sports experience like his does. Both James and Kyrie Irving also decided to make a statement, wearing  I Can't Breathe  T-shirts over their jerseys prior to their conference matchup against the Brooklyn Nets. <br /> <br /> After the game James was asked his reason for wearing the T-shirt, and he <a href= http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2014/12/09/james-kyrie-nets-in-i-cant-breathe-shirts/20116207/  target= _hplink >responded</a>,  It was a message to the family. That I'm sorry for their loss, sorry to his wife. That's what it's about.  He went on to say,  I think everybody else gets caught up in everything else besides who's really feeling it, and that's the family. That's what it's about. <br /> <br /> Those statements aren't easy to hear. For once, LeBron James -- the anti-Michael Jordan in every way, no matter how much we try to compare the two -- sounded very Jordan-esque. It appears that James was more interested in playing it safe, unwilling to ruffle the feathers of his corporate sponsors and brands.<br /> <br /> By wearing the shirt he was making a statement just like his signature  tomahawk  dunk. However, his post-game press conference offered a different sound byte -- echoing his 2011 NBA Finals appearance. He was fading into the corner, scared to bring out the brute presence and talent he casts on his opponents on the court. He backtracked, only looking at the killings of unarmed black men from a surface-level perspective. One can't wave the baton of injustice and represent the voice of the unheard yet retract his or her true sentiments when under judgment and pressure from others. <br /> <br /> James knows that by wearing the shirt, he was carrying the weight of a culture and a community that is systemically treated as inferior through the education system, the prison-industrial complex, etc. To James' credit, he has been very vocal on a number of social issues, most notably on the Trayvon Martin killing when he and his then-teammates <a href= http://grantland.com/features/trayvon-martin-miami-heat-talk-talk-hoodies/  target= _hplink >posed for a photo with their hoodies covering their heads</a>. He is widely admired in is hometown of Akron, Ohio, as a person who constantly gives back to his community and leads by example. <br /> <br /> However, in this particular instance James dodged. Toward the end of his post-game press conference, one of the reporters asked James if there was a larger message, beyond what he'd just said, that should be considered. Sounding almost frustrated, James responded,  How much larger can it be than to just pay respects to the family?  <br /> <br /> LeBron James usually expresses his opinions on social issues, particularly those dealing with his own community, a little bit better. But in this one instance, I hope he will revisit his perspective. "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 00:25:53 -0500"	"crime"

Hudson, an 8th grade biology teacher at KIPP Amp Middle School in Brooklyn, told The Huffington Post that the grand jury decisions not to indict police officers for killing black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and in Staten Island, New York, have been “upsetting everyone” at his school. <br /> <br /> “We’re all teachers and we teach in the neighborhoods that are most at risk of discriminatory police practices, and we’re honestly all terrified every day for our students,  Hudson said.  I mean, teaching 8th graders and high schoolers, we’re terrified that they’re going to face the threats that other young black men have faced in our country.” <br /> <br /> Even in his science class, Hudson said students have been talking about topics related to Brown and Garner.<br /> <br /> “In science class we talk about the psychology of racism, we talk about the psychology of discrimination, we talk about whether race us even anything or whether it’s a social construct,” Hudson said.<br /> <br /> Jonathan McIntosh, a vice principal at the same KIPP school, said he's from the Ferguson area and said his students seem personally affected by the grand jury decisions.<br /> <br /> “Kids are very acutely aware of everything that’s happening and if we don’t take the time and pause as educators and really think about … how these things are so pervasive, what’s the point of doing what we’re doing,” said McIntosh. He continued, “They don’t feel like their voice is heard. When the grand jury decisions [were] handed out, they’re all talking and they’re like, ‘What exactly is going on here? What does that mean for someone who looks like me?’”<br /> <br /> Photos of the protest below: <br /> <br /> <img alt= teachers3  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387610/original.jpg  /><br /> <br /> <img alt= embed2  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387606/original.jpg  /><br /> <br /> <img alt= teachers1  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387604/original.jpg  /><br /> <br /> <blockquote class= instagram-media  data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version= 4  style=  background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px); ><div style= padding:8px; > <div style=  background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%; > <div style=  background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px; ></div></div> <p style=  margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px; > <a href= https://instagram.com/p/whbXPfP7Ii/  style=  color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;  target= _top >happening now.. #ericgarner #icantbreathe</a></p> <p style=  color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap; >A video posted by rasheedyoung (@rasheedyoung) on <time style=  font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;  datetime= 2014-12-12T21:47:59+00:00 >Dec 12, 2014 at 1:47pm PST</time></p></div></blockquote><br /> <script async defer src= //platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js ></script> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 22:37:24 -0500"	"crime"
"Cornell McNeal Allegedly Linked To Rape, Murder In Park By Cellphone And DNA"	"<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — A damaged cellphone and DNA evidence were used to connect a man accused of raping and fatally burning a woman at a Wichita, Kansas, park to the crime, affidavits released Friday show.</p><br />               <p>A judge Friday ordered the release of the documents used to support charges against Cornell McNeal after The Associated Press, The Wichita Eagle and broadcasters KWCH, KAKE and KSN argued that they are  presumed to be open  under a new Kansas law.</p><br />               <p>McNeal, 26, is jailed on a $1.25 million bond on charges that include one count of capital murder or an alternative count of first-degree murder in the death of 36-year-old Letitia  Tish  Davis. The mother of four suffered from burns on more than half her body and cuts on her head in the Nov. 14 attack and died Nov. 22.</p><br />               <p>McNeal's attorney had sought to keep the records closed. However, the media outlets argued that the defense didn't have a good reason for the records to be sealed, as required under a law that took effect in July. The new law reversed one dating to the 1980s that closed the records to the public unless otherwise ordered by a court to be unsealed.</p><br />               <p>Lyndon W. Vix, an attorney for the five media outlets, said Judge Ben Burgess' ruling  is consistent with what the intent of the Legislature was when they passed this legislation. </p><br />               <p>The affidavits provided only few new details. Among them was that authorities connected McNeal to the attack through a damaged flip phone found at the park. McNeal told investigators that he got a lighter from a woman outside a bar in the area on the night of the attack but denied having any contact with a woman in the park</p><br />               <p>The documents said firefighters went to the park near Wichita State University after a neighbor reported a grassfire. There, the firefighters found a nude and bloody Davis. The affidavits say Davis told firefighters that someone she didn't know had raped her, beaten her and set her on fire.

"Bill Nye: Creationism Is 'Raising A Generation Of Young People Who Can't Think'"	"The biggest danger creationism plays, according to Bill Nye the  Science Guy,  is that it is raising a generation of children who  can't think   and who  will not be able to participate in the future in same way  as those who are taught evolution.<br /> <br /> Speaking on <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq3CvTP_LHc  target= _hplink >MidPoint</a>, Nye said he blames an older generation of evangelicals  who have very strong conservative views  and who are  reluctant to let kids learn about evolution.  Their <a href= http://www.businessinsider.com/texas-school-board-debate-on-evolution-2013-11  target= _hplink >presence on school boards</a> leads to debates over curriculum, Nye argued, which further inhibits schools' ability to teach facts.<br /> <br />  Religion is one thing. People get tremendous comfort and community with their religions,  Nye said.  But whatever you believe, whatever deity or higher power you might believe in, the Earth is not 6,000 years old.  <br /> <br /> Nye, who has a new book out titled  Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation,  recently participated in a <a href= http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/02/04/271648691/watch-the-creationism-vs-evolution-debate-bill-nye-and-ken-ham  target= _hplink >debate</a> with creationist Ken Ham, which some argued was a moment of embarrassment for the science community.<br /> <br /> University of Chicago evolution professor Jerry A. Coyne <a href= http://jerrycoyne.uchicago.edu/about.html  target= _hplink >called</a> the debate  pointless and counterproductive.  The Guardian's Pete Etchells <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/feb/05/bill-nye-vs-ken-ham-creationism-science-debate  target= _hplink >wrote</a>:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>Scientific literacy is crucial for society to function effectively, which means that we can’t afford to be messing around with the way that it’s taught in the classroom or wasting our time with fruitless public debates.</blockquote><br /> <br /> Nye stood by the debate, however, saying he  stepped into the lion's den  in order to spread awareness about the academic opportunities children are denied by being creationism. <br /> <br />  They will not have this fundamental idea that you can question things, that you can think critically, that you can use skeptical thought to learn about nature,  Nye told MidPoint.  These children have to suppress everything that they can see in nature to try to get a world view that's compatible with the adults in who they trust and rely on for sustenance. <br /> <br /> <em>H/T <a href= http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/12/bill-nye-children-taught-creationism-will-not-be-able-to-participate-in-the-future/  target= _hplink >RawStory</a></em> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 08:59:01 -0500"	"education"
"Teachers Protest Grand Jury Decisions At Police Precinct"	"New York City teachers Friday night joined <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/high-school-students-protest-ferguson_n_6249802.html  target= _hplink >nationwide protests</a> against grand jury decisions in the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, gathering outside a police precinct in Harlem.<br /> <br /> Several hundred teachers protested outside the station house in what was dubbed on Facebook as the “<a href= https://www.facebook.com/events/965839523431652/  target= _hplink >Hands Up, Don’t Shoot National Teachers Protest</a>.” The New York-based organizers -- two teachers who work at schools in the <a href= http://www.kipp.org/  target= _hplink >KIPP Public Charter School Network</a> -- encouraged teachers throughout the nation to participate. <br /> <br /> “We are just average teachers empowered to do something and make change,” says the Facebook page for the event. “We need to target our message to the police officers that directly engage with our students day to day.”<br /> <br /> A.J. Hudson, an 8th grade biology teacher at KIPP Amp Middle School in Brooklyn, told The Huffington Post that the grand jury decisions not to indict police officers for killing black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and in Staten Island, New York, have been “upsetting everyone” at his school. <br /> <br /> “We’re all teachers and we teach in the neighborhoods that are most at risk of discriminatory police practices, and we’re honestly all terrified every day for our students,  Hudson said.  I mean, teaching 8th graders and high schoolers, we’re terrified that they’re going to face the threats that other young black men have faced in our country.” <br /> <br /> Even in his science class, Hudson said students have been talking about topics related to Brown and Garner.<br /> <br /> “In science class we talk about the psychology of racism, we talk about the psychology of discrimination, we talk about whether race us even anything or whether it’s a social construct,” Hudson said.<br /> <br /> Jonathan McIntosh, a vice principal at the same KIPP school, said he's from the Ferguson area and said his students seem personally affected by the grand jury decisions.<br /> <br /> “Kids are very acutely aware of everything that’s happening and if we don’t take the time and pause as educators and really think about … how these things are so pervasive, what’s the point of doing what we’re doing,” said McIntosh. He continued, “They don’t feel like their voice is heard. When the grand jury decisions [were] handed out, they’re all talking and they’re like, ‘What exactly is going on here? What does that mean for someone who looks like me?’”<br /> <br /> Photos of the protest below: <br /> <br /> <img alt= teachers3  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387610/original.jpg  /><br /> <br /> <img alt= embed2  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387606/original.jpg  /><br /> <br /> <img alt= teachers1  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387604/original.jpg  /><br /> <br /> <blockquote class= instagram-media  data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version= 4  style=  background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px); ><div style= padding:8px; > <div style=  background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%; > <div style=  background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px; ></div></div> <p style=  margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px; > <a href= https://instagram.com/p/whbXPfP7Ii/  style=  color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;  target= _top >happening now.. #ericgarner #icantbreathe</a></p> <p style=  color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap; >A video posted by rasheedyoung (@rasheedyoung) on <time style=  font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;  datetime= 2014-12-12T21:47:59+00:00 >Dec 12, 2014 at 1:47pm PST</time></p></div></blockquote><br /> <script async defer src= //platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js ></script> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 22:37:24 -0500"	"education"
"Students Give Professors Better Evaluations If They Think They're Male: Study"	"Students tend to give better evaluations to their professors if they think they're male instead of female, according to <a href= http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4  target= _hplink >a study</a> published last week in the journal Innovative Higher Education.<br /> <br /> The study, led by Lillian MacNell, a doctoral student at North Carolina State University, used an online summer course on introductory anthropology and sociology to, essentially, <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfish_%28film%29  target= _hplink >catfish</a> students. The class was divided into four discussion groups, with two assistant instructors, one male and one female, teaching two discussions groups each. The assistant instructors collaborated to write and teach in similar ways. <br /> <br /> However, the male instructor only told one of his groups that he was male, and told his other group he was female. Likewise, the female instructor only told one group she was female, and told her other group she was male.<br /> <br /> At the end of the course, students were asked to fill out an evaluation about their instructor. Overall, the instructors did not receive significantly different evaluations. But the female instructor received better evaluations when students thought she was male. The male instructor, meanwhile, received worse evaluations when students thought he was female.<br /> <br /> <script id= infogram_0_mean-of-student-ratings---male  src= //e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?64g  type= text/javascript ></script><div style= width:100%;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center; ><a target= _blank  href= https://infogr.am/mean-of-student-ratings---male  style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none; >Mean of Student Ratings - Male Instructor</a> |<a style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;  href= https://infogr.am  target= _blank >Create infographics</a></div><br /> <br /> <script id= infogram_0_mean-of-student-ratings---female-instructor  src= //e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?i1m  type= text/javascript ></script><div style= width:100%;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center; ><a target= _blank  href= https://infogr.am/mean-of-student-ratings---female-instructor  style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none; >Mean of Student Ratings - Female Instructor</a> |<a style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;  href= https://infogr.am  target= _blank >Create infographics</a></div><br /> <br /> <br /> The evaluations also included specific questions about how the instructor performed, and the responses to these questions reveal an even deeper bias. Both instructors returned grades to their students after two days. But when students were asked to rate their instructors on promptness, instructors perceived as male received an average rating of 4.35 out of 5, while instructors perceived as females received an average rating of only 3.55.<br /> <br /> Male-perceived instructors also scored higher on questions about interpersonal measures, even though, according to the study,  both actual instructors demonstrated the same level of interpersonal interaction in their attempts to create a sense of immediacy in the online classroom.  The researchers theorized that female instructors are generally expected to have high interpersonal skills -- meaning that a female instructor would have to work harder than a male instructor just to get the same rating.<br /> <br /> The study argues that if these biases are coming across so clearly in teacher evaluations,  this particular form of inequality needs to be taken into consideration as women apply for academic jobs and come up for promotion and review.

"Faith & Science: Stages For My Imagination"	"<strong>By Laura Telfer</strong><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Untitled.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-Untitled.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Untitled-thumb.jpg  width= 250  height= 354 style= float: left; margin:10px /></a><br /> I take a deep breath, close my eyes, and unlock my imagination. I allow my mind and body to become one, harmonize with my surroundings, and enable myself to find that place where I am perfectly content. Exhale. As I recollect, I am drawn to a scene from a movie. I try to concentrate on that image, but various sounds overwhelm my senses. A patch of blue dominates my vision. Suddenly, I am submerged in water. My eyes sting, and my imagination consumes my body. Silence. When I open my eyes, my senses are enlightened by the ocean's clarity. I lift my head and am greeted by two familiar faces, Marlin the Clownfish and Crush the Turtle.<br /> <br /> All things Finding Nemo are scattered about my bedroom--posters, stuffed animals and even a night light. Their presence causes the best scenes to replay in my mind when I meditate. I let my imagination explore and relive the lessons Marlin learned through his journey. Marlin's experiences renewed his enthusiasm; he became a passionate, lively, and risk-taking child again. I no longer see him, but myself, learning the value of a creative engagement with life. <br /> <br /> Imagination is the infrastructure of reality. When I teach at my church, I use my imagination to craft puppet shows for the children to keep them engaged with the material. I put a screen between the door and place a puppet in my dominant hand. I usually play the role of Fireball the Dragon, who often gets himself stuck in sticky situations. With the help of Ponder the Blue Monster, Fireball and the children learn the importance of friendship and Christian values. It makes me happy when I see them laughing and listening attentively during the show. My imagination allows me to connect with the kids on a more personal level, which helps me expand their horizons.<br /> <br /> My creativity has also helped me throughout my science career. Last summer, I was selected to work with NASA engineers on eight extensive web-based assignments, which included designing a lunar colony, a Crew Transport Vehicle, and a space shuttle. At the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, I helped wire a rover that had an external structure of Legos and cardboard. I suggested adding the radiation shield of aluminum foil. Team Curiosity and I programmed the robot to respond to the inputs of a control pad, and we entered a challenge that required our robot to pick up Moon rocks and water samples under timed conditions. <br /> <br /> When the competition began, our rover refused to cooperate and went out of bounds many times. Even after reprogramming it and replacing its arm, Curious George still could not pick up the rocks and bring them back to home base. Our failure was disheartening, but I didn't let this experience discourage me from pursuing a STEM career. <br /> <br /> I turned toward science when my mom was diagnosed with Lupus. Her symptoms did not become obvious until I was in middle school, and she began having difficulty climbing the stairs by herself. A year later, she started chemotherapy. Watching my mom battle with this has been extremely difficult, and I intend to use my knowledge of Lupus to treat others that are struggling. I will use my creativity to design advanced medical machinery that will save lives and help patients cope with pain.<br /> <br /> Some days I wish I could go back in time to the childhood days with the adventure and curiosity that my unbounded mind translated into an undying love for Finding Nemo.  While my movie preferences have changed, my imagination is still here and still constitutes the environments where I feel most content. I build robots, play with puppets, and find inventive ways to convey my visions. Science labs and church are just two among many stages where I perform, and my imagination is still the foundation of all my shows. <br /> <br /> <em>Laura, a graduate from Jackson Liberty High School, is currently a freshman at Cornell.</em> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 17:26:04 -0500"	"education"

The ones where the kids would shout  More Ovaltine, please!  and then the commercial would list the seemingly infinite benefits of the sugary chocolate milk powder? It has a few vitamins and minerals going for it, but it was primarily the hook of the hype machine that had us buying. The hype machine of the mindfulness movement is rolling stronger than ever right now, particularly as it relates to incorporating mindfulness-based practices into our schools. But now the hype is being bolstered by a growing body of empirical evidence from a variety of sectors.<br /> <br /> My personal practice of mindfulness was sparked by the teaching of <a href= http://www.mindfulcloud.com/thichnhathanh/  target= _blank >Zen Master Thích Nhất Hạnh</a>, and was reinforced when I attended his 5-day  Happy Teachers Will Change the World  retreat in Ayutthaya, Thailand back in April 2013. Here we were, teachers from all over the world meditating together and discussing the myriad intersections between our personal practice and what we've been able to integrate (or not) into our classrooms. But we weren't just talking in the experiential; we were backing up our experiences by referencing the burgeoning arena of mindfulness-based science in the schools.<br /> <br /> I was particularly interested in its application to schools considered  low-income  and/or  at-risk.  My experience teaching on the <a href= busd40.org  target= _blank >Tohono O'odham Native American Reservation</a>, in low-income high schools and in a juvenile detention center often pulled me to areas of most need.<br /> <br /> One teacher brought up the 2011-2012 collaboration between <a href= http://mindfulschools.org/  target= _blank >Mindful Schools</a> and <a href= http://education.ucdavis.edu/  target= _blank >UC Davis</a> -- a study that involved 937 students, 47 teachers and 3 public elementary schools that were certainly considered  at-risk.  For a detailed breakdown of how the study was conducted, dive into <a href= http://www.mindfulschools.org/pdf/Mindful-Schools-Study-Highlights.pdf  target= _blank >the PDF here</a>. A few highlighted results:<br /> <blockquote> One teacher showed a video of a student taking a mindful breath after stumbling during a poem recitation in front of 300 students. <br /> <br />  One teacher showed a video of a child kicking chairs after getting a spelling quiz answer wrong, then suddenly stopping, putting his hand on his anchor spot, taking a few breaths, and picking up the chairs. </blockquote><br /> These were the kind of stories being told at the retreat. Some teachers had asked their students to see the classroom bell as a mindfulness bell. This involved -- at the sound of the bell and instead of rushing to pack up -- taking three breaths before gathering their materials and leaving. Students and teachers both reported feeling less rushed at the end of class and more receptive/calm at the very beginning of their next class.<br /> <br /> In 2013 the <em><a href= http://bjp.rcpsych.org/  target= _blank >British Journal of Psychiatry</a></em> published an article titled  Effectiveness of the Mindfulness in Schools Programme: non-randomized controlled feasibility study  (<a href= http://mindfulnessinschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Kukyen-20-June-2013.pdf  target= _blank >see PDF</a>) in which researchers from the University of Exeter and Cambridge University sought to fill in this much-needed gap:<br /> <br />  Mindfulness-based approaches for adults are effective at enhancing mental health, but few controlled trials have evaluated their effectiveness among young people.  So they took to the schools. Twelve secondary schools, to be exact. Their findings?<br /> <blockquote> This study provides preliminary evidence that the programme [<a href= http://mindfulnessinschools.org/courses/b-for-teens/  target= _blank >Mindfulness Programme .b</a>] ameliorates low-grade depressive symptoms both immediately following the programme and at 3-month follow-up. This is a potentially very important finding given that low-grade depressive symptoms not only impair functioning but are also a powerful risk factor for depression in adolescents and adults. </blockquote><br /> Similar results are being seen across the board and in a variety of cultures and countries.

The type of thought may vary by age, personal circumstance, setting, or institutional mission, but food is an essential interest in every learner's life. Something so universally important offers rich opportunities for interdisciplinary learning.<br /> <br /> Food served on a campus conveys values: Do we value healthy, tasty, and sustainable? Food choices carry social and environmental justice implications for the future as well as for today. Cheap food costs here may be built upon harsh labor and environmentally degrading practices elsewhere. We need to ask what the changing climate will do to the global capacity to produce food, and how we will feed 9 billion people in a warming world.<br /> <br /> Educating for change includes educating future generations of healthy, ethical food producers and consumers, the kind of independent thinkers and learners who can put ideas into action and help change the way we interact with food on a daily basis. Not all teaching takes place in a classroom. Campuses can enable students to explore issues of food health, sustainability, and justice by experimenting with new models of production and delivery that can help solve resource challenges, locally and globally.<br /> <br /> I live in the Pioneer Valley on a campus built on farmland and orchards cradled by the Holyoke Range. Land and location shape our days. Some forward-looking professors in the 1970s established a Farm Center, integrating the study and practice of sustainable farming and food systems into a liberal arts program. A flexible interdisciplinary academic structure enables students and faculty to work in and across a wide variety of fields, using the Farm Center as a hub.<br /> <br /> Again, questions and resources available within institutions will vary, but every learner is interested in food. Just as each school must be true to its own mission, each setting will present unique opportunities to take full advantage of food as an academic resource.<br /> <br /> Some students will learn to manage and run food operations or farms. Some may come up with truly revolutionary ideas with the potential to change food systems for the future. All will become more-informed consumers.<br /> <br /> The Hampshire community is working to demonstrate that if you're thoughtful, you can enjoy high-quality food that's sustainable, good for you and good for the world, and not have it be terribly expensive. We call it the Healthy Food Transition. In my next post here, I will share some specific choices and actions we're taking, as a case study from one campus, with the goal of getting others to think and talk about what is being done or might be possible on other campuses.

"Ask the Art Professor: Can a Math Teacher Become an Art Teacher?"	"<em> I presently enjoy the rare chance to teach drawing in my math class. We have discussed perspective and symmetry so my math students are working on drawing in perspective. After teaching high school math classes for almost ten years, I am more than ready to get out. I would like to teach art or digital imaging at the high school level. However, I feel trapped in this high-demand, high-pressure, test-obsessed field with no room for advancement or creativity. Although I could obtain a certification to teach art in my state, I have never been to art school. I suppose my question is about how feasible this is. Could a math teacher teach art? </em><br /> <br /> Technically speaking, if you obtain the required certification and degrees to teach studio art, you can do it.  However, being an effective art teacher is much more than degrees and certification. A huge part of being a successful art teacher is the ability to draw from your own experience as a visual artist. You can read, write, and analyze all you want about art theory, art technique, art education, etc., but until you have the hands-on experience of actually making your own artwork, your ability to teach studio art will remain superficial.  The equivalent would be a soccer coach who reads about soccer techniques, but has never physically played a soccer game. <br /> <br /> Teaching studio art at the high school level has its own unique set of challenges. Most high school art teachers teach general art courses that cover a wide range of techniques. For this reason, you need to have expertise in multiple techniques: drawing, painting, sculpture, and more. You have to know all of these processes inside out, which requires many years of working with those techniques through your own artwork. Teaching a course as specialized as digital imaging at the high school level would be rare, usually only private preparatory schools are able to offer a course like that. <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-15776321877_d7ae1a37a4_b.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-15776321877_d7ae1a37a4_b.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-15776321877_d7ae1a37a4_b-thumb.jpg  width= 367  height= 550  /></a></center><br /> <br /> There are many aspects of creating your own artwork that would tremendously inform your capacity to teach studio art. Troubleshooting is a significant part of creating your own artwork, and you will learn much more from your mistakes than from your moments of success. For example, it took me years of mistakes to figure out a reliable technique for stretching canvases.  Despite technical demonstrations by my teachers, I made many errors: my canvases were too loose; I didn't accurately measure my rabbitskin glue sizing which resulted in cracked oil paintings, etc. It was only after making these blunders that I could see what was required to execute the technique properly. These experiences are critical to being an art teacher because you acquire practical strategies for difficult problems.<br /> <br /> So much of my time as a teacher is devoted to showing students how to fix things when something doesn't work out. Students will make mistakes, and you have to be able to provide your students with options no matter what goes wrong. The demonstrations I give emphasize ways of dodging potential problems. As much as I try to anticipate problems, new issues always arise that you could never foresee.  One of my colleagues told me that a student once accidentally ran a pencil through a printmaking press! Since hearing this story, I am adamant about telling students that absolutely nothing is ever allowed on a printmaking press other than the press blankets. Being told what to avoid is just as important as being told what to do. <br /> <br /> Making art is usually a very physical process, and seeing a professional in action can be tremendously influential. The individual demonstrations I give to my students can have a greater impact than any verbal description I can provide. In my drawing classes, I often ask students to simply watch my body movements while I draw.  I tell them to not look at the drawing I'm making, but instead to see the direction my wrist moves in, the sweeping motions I make with my arm, and to observe the swift pacing of my movements. These physical actions could never be portrayed in a book, they simply have to be experienced in real life and can only be demonstrated by someone who has done it many times before. <br /> <br /> Essentially, you have to be an artist before you can be a studio art teacher.  Students look to their teachers to be role models, and they need to see that their teachers have active studio practices. This makes the idea of being a professional artist real for students.  Initiate your career change by building your own history as a working artist. Collect your own tricks of the trade, and share those experiences with your students. Inhabiting both roles as artist and teacher will enrich your art students beyond measure. <br /> <br /> <em>Ask the Art Professor is an advice column for visual artists.

Amy wrote:<br /> <br /> “ Please convey my deepest appreciation to all of your officers and team, and more generally convey my support for all of their expert and caring protection and policing of our community.”</blockquote><br /> <br /> During the protest, Gutmann responded to the protesters saying,  Black lives matter -- all lives matter.  <br /> <br />  Black lives have not been served the way I and others would like them to be served,  <a href= http://www.thedp.com/article/2014/12/protesters-take-over-gutmanns-holiday-party  target= _hplink >Gutmann said</a>, according to the DP, before adding to cheers,  Let me say that again: Black lives matter. <br /> <br /> <center><iframe width= 560  height= 315  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/GMUAhsIeqx8  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 12:28:24 -0500"	"education"

"Personalized Learning in K-12 Schools: How Do We Make it Happen?"	"The idea that no two students learn in exactly the same way is nothing new. Even back in the 1800s, Helen Parkhurst was advocating for an educational system that took the personalized needs of the student into account when developing curriculum and helped children learn independence, both academically and in life. Her  Dalton Plan  was formulated with the thought that all students learn at a different pace and should be allowed to take the time they need to work through their studies and explore the areas that interest them the most.<br /> <br /> Before the rapid advancements in technology of the past two decades, Parkhurst's ideals were just that: lofty and unrealistic in a typical K-12 classroom. With teacher accountability rising, and test scores being high-stakes, the idea of taking the one-on-one time to accommodate the needs of each student has often been viewed as far-fetched. Where can educators find the time?<br /> <br /> Enter technology from companies like Epiphany Learning™ which offers a personalized learning app. The very tools and technology that allow us to pay a bill from our phones, or track our entire schedule through a tablet, also make personalized learning more of a possibility in K-12 classrooms. Personalized learning is no longer an obscure theory that applies to a small group of students who can afford to attend the schools that offer it; technology makes it a mainstream possibility and one that has the ability to positively impact all types of learners in this generation of K-12 students. <br /> <br /> Technology is making personalized learning easier. Educators now have more resources available than ever before when it comes to accommodating students on their own academic paths and making sure they are successful. In just a fraction of the time, teachers can accommodate many different learning styles with the same materials, and ensure that each style is being addressed.<br /> <br /> Students are embracing this push toward greater empowerment in their own learning journeys, too. When students understand why they learn a particular way, and what learning style will benefit them the most, they can seek out their own ways to develop those strengths. Giving students a voice, and a choice, when it comes to how they learn is the first step toward empowering them in their own learning and career paths.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Learner Profile™</strong><br /> <br /> The first part of personalized learning implementation is to find out exactly how each student learns. Epiphany Learning™ considers the auditory, kinesthetic and visual strengths of each student and then uses that information to identify personal, student-directed learning styles, highlight strengths and struggles, and link hobbies and interests. <br /> <br /> The proprietary system of Epiphany Learning™ allows educators to find out the exact Learner Profile™ of a student to create a personalized plan for learning. This step eliminates any guesswork associated with creating personalized plans by guiding the educator through the process. It can also be eye-opening when it comes to the way a particular students learns and can inform an educator's future lesson and in-class activity plans. <br /> <br /> <strong>Learning Paths™</strong><br /> <br /> This is where the profile of the learner and technology really come together to provide a customized academic path for students. Instead of teachers spending an excess amount of time brainstorming the different ways to teach the same material in several different ways, learning paths like those suggested by Epiphany Learning™ can outline it and point teachers in the right direction for personalized learning success. The Epiphany Learning™ system also involves students, empowering them to suggest assignments and provide feedback on their own academic journey. <br /> <br /> These learning paths also provide a clear connection between parents, students, teachers and administrators on progress of students, allowing modifications based on what seems to be working and what may not be fitting the learning needs of a particular learner. <br /> <br /> <strong>Skills Paths™</strong><br /> <br /> The next step in the personalized ideology of Epiphany Learning is to help students develop beyond academics alone. This includes learning important life skills like self-discipline and behavior, and developing healthy learning habits and attitudes towards academics. Students who have a positive approach to their academics, the  career  of their childhoods, are more likely to succeed in the workplace. In other words, impactful learning cannot exist in a vacuum.

"San Francisco To Offer Ethnic Studies At All 19 Of Its Public High Schools"	"The San Francisco school board voted unanimously on Tuesday to require <a href= http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Ethnic-studies-courses-coming-to-all-S-F-high-5946855.php  target= _hplink >all of the city’s 19 public high schools to offer ethnic studies courses</a>. <br /> <br /> In offering ethnic studies across the city’s school system, San Francisco became the third California city to offer such courses, even as they spark controversy in more conservative Southwestern states. <br /> <br /> “When you look at [the ethnic studies] curriculum, it is really about a deeper and broader knowledge about systems of oppression that have been historic in our country and in the world,” board President Sandra Fewer said, <a href= http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/sfusd-board-to-vote-on-expanding-ethnic-studies-curriculum-to-all-high-schools/Content?oid=2913811  target= _hplink >according to the San Francisco Examiner</a>.<br />  <br /> Under the proposal, courses will start next fall, with the long-term goal of eventually making them a graduation requirement. <br /> <br /> “I absolutely believe ethnic studies is a game changer in helping us love ourselves, in helping young people love themselves,” San Francisco school board member Kim-Shree Maufas said, <a href= http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Ethnic-studies-courses-coming-to-all-S-F-high-5946855.php  target= _hplink >according to the San Francisco Gate.</a> “They are so bombarded in how to hate themselves.”<br /> <br /> Los Angeles Unified School District went a step further last month by voting to require all students to take a one-semester class in the subject area in order to graduate. The new requirement goes into effect in the 2018-2019 school year. <br /> <br /> The El Ranchero school district outside Los Angeles became the <a href= http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2014/07/california_district_adopts_eth.html?qs=ethnic+studies  target= _hplink >first one in California to adopt the requirement in July</a>.  <br /> <br /> California Assemblyman <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/03/california-ethnic-studies_n_4892111.html  target= _hplink >Luis Alejo (D-Salinas) introduced a proposal</a> earlier this year to direct the state's education department to develop a model to implement a statewide ethnic studies curriculum, but the legislature did not approve it. <br /> <br /> The trend toward offering ethnic studies more widely in California public schools runs contrary to more hostile views taken by state officials in the Southwest.  <br /> <br /> The Republican-packed Arizona state legislature <a href= http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/04/19/neither-banned-nor-allowed-mexican-american-studies-in-limbo-in-arizona/  target= _hplink >outlawed a controversial Mexican-American Studies course</a> in Tucson that independent researchers <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/mexican-american-studies-student-achievement_n_6249592.html  target= _hplink >credit with raising student achievement and increasing graduation rates</a>.

"13 Irresponsible Reasons to Get Someone a Puppy for Christmas"	"And by you getting a puppy, I mean me, too, please, I really want a Golden Retriever. The problem I face is the same as the one Juliette encounters in my new book, <a href= http://jayclarkbooks.com/finding-mr-brightside  target= _hplink >Finding Mr. Brightside</a> -- namely, the brick wall I live with (and love everything else about besides her anti-puppy outlook) doesn't think it's the best idea. She thinks it's the worst during the other 11 months of the year, too, but my dream seems to shatter against the brick-like  No  of her facial expression more loudly and tragically at Christmas.    <br /> <br /> Since when did getting someone (like me) a puppy that he may/may not be able to take care of become such a non-starter? Since the economy started taking a poo on us annually? Since our employers used said annual poo to start feeding employees 2 percent-raise sandwiches (with a poo-like spread on top) year after year? Since the Humane Society began airing those brutal homeless animal commercials on TV and scaring away aspiring pet owners from biting off more responsibility than they can chew? <br /> <br /> Let's leave all of the above questions unanswered in order to better prove my point. <br /> <br /> <strong>Here's why the surprise puppy needs to make a Christmas gift comeback:</strong> <br /> <br /> 1. Puppy won't make fun of the childhood ornament with your busted 5th grade picture on it.  <br /> <br /> 2. Plenty of reasons to get new furniture when puppy chews away your college-dorm-room decor! <br /> <br /> 3. Yes, you'll have to take puppy out when it's freezing outside, over and over again, but think of all the additional steps being tracked per the Health app on your iPhone.<br /> <br /> 4. Less time to check unimportant things like the Health app on your iPhone -- puppy needs to go out again.<br /> <br /> 5. Needed to sweep the floors more often, anyway.<br /> <br /> 6. Needed to replace the carpets, anyway.<br /> <br /> 7. It'll force you to have something to talk about with the neighbors ... I've heard this can be a good thing?? <br /> <br /> 8. You need someone, preferably a dog, who can bark at the initially scary (but ultimately nonthreatening) sound of the UPS man dropping a package at your door. <br /> <br /> 9. Ever noticed how the barks of Golden Retrievers are so friendly-sounding? This may remind potential burglars of their childhoods, making them feel too guilty to proceed with a holiday robbery.<br /> <br /> 10. Okay, the squirrel outside is not the burglar that your puppy thinks it is. But at least there's no burglar! The barking will stop as puppy gets older and more lazy.   <br /> <br /> 11. Be honest, what's more exciting to your inner child? A) Cologne B) Puppy!!!<br /> <br /> 12. If you answered A, I'm not sure that bottle of Eternity will help you open back up your soul quite as effectively as what's underneath Box B (open it!!!).<br /> <br /> 13. Puppy will still act like it's Christmas the day after Christmas. The day after that? Still Christmas! And so on.  <br /> <br /> Am I missing any logic-ignoring reasons why everyone should be getting a puppy underneath their tree this year, especially me?

"'Don't Jerk And Drive' Campaign Pulled"	"Jerking isn't a joke and they know it.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the South Dakota office of Highway Safety, some people think their new safe-driving campaign around the slogan  don't jerk and drive  was a bad idea.<br /> <br /> The ad campaign, intended to keep people from over correcting and jerking their steering wheels in icy conditions, struck some as offensive because of its allusion to masturbation.<br /> <br /> <img alt= jerk  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388614/thumbs/o-JERK-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br />  I decided to pull the ad,  Trevor Jones, the secretary of the Department of Public Safety said in a statement obtained by the <a href= http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2014/12/11/jerk-drive-campaign-stirs-discussion/20240607/  target= _hplink >Argus Leader.</a>  This is an important safety message and I don't want this innuendo to distract from our goal to save lives on the road. <br /> <br /> One of the critics, according to the paper, was state Rep.

"'Boob Goddess' Takiko Shindo Creates Bust-Enlarging Rake"	"A Japanese woman known as the  Boob Goddess  hopes to rake in cash with a modified rake that she claims can firm a woman's bust and even enlarge it.<br /> <br /> Takiko Shindo is known for something called  Oppai Taisou,  which roughly translates into English as <a href= http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/12/11/oppai-taisou-hand-the-pink-plastic-hand-that-will-exercise-your-boobs-to-new-heights/  target= _hplink >boob exercise massage. </a><br /> <br /> Her latest advancement in the bustling field of bust enhancement is something called the  Oppai Taisou Hand,  that is basically a pink rake for stroking and brushing one's breasts, according to Rocket News 24.<br /> <br /> <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuSwQgDICNw  target= _hplink >The rakish product</a> sells online for between $41 and $54. A commercial suggests it can increase a woman's bust by three centimeters.<br /> <br /> The so-called  science,  according to Shindo, is that ligaments holding up breasts need to move. Otherwise fats in the same area settle down around the chest muscles, and causes breasts to sag, Rocket News 24 reports.<br /> <br /> As titillating as it sounds, Shindo's theory flies in the face of modern medicine, according to <a href= http://barryhandlermd.com/  target= _hplink >Dr. Barry Handler,</a> a board-certified cosmetic surgeon in San Diego.<br /> <br />  There are ligaments in breast tissue that stretch over time,  he told HuffPost.  But once they stretch, they don't snap back. Ligaments aren't like muscles -- there's no contractible property. <br /> <br /> But Shindo's mammary massage device may not be a complete bust, according to <a href= http://fibroidrfa.com/  target= _hplink >Dr. Bruce Lee, </a>a Beverly Hills-based gynecologist.<br /> <br />  Usage of the breast rake upon oneself actually does accomplish several things that theoretically could alter the perception of breast size and shape,  he told HuffPost by email.  When holding the rake in the right hand and massaging and lifting the left breast, one is actually exercising the right pectoral muscles, which lie beneath the breast. <br /> <br /> Lee says these muscles, when exercised, will enlarge and tighten and add shape to the upper body. He also says mechanical breast stimulation can increase breast growth in both men and women.<br /> <br />  Certainly, the breast hand or rake is a novel stimulus for the manufacturer, who, no doubt, is smiling. And, pardon the pun, handily raking it in,  he said.<br /> <br /> <style type= text/css >@media only screen and (min-width : 500px) {.ethanmobile { display: none; }}</style><br /> <br /> <a href= https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostWeirdNews ><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/FBLOGO_0.png ></a> <a href= https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostWeirdNews  target= _hplink >Like Us On Facebook</a> | <br class= ethanmobile  /> <a href= https://twitter.com/HuffPostWeird ><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/TWITTERBIRD.png ></a> <a href= https://twitter.com/HuffPostWeird  target= _hplink >Follow Us On Twitter</a> | <br class= ethanmobile  /> <a href= mailto:david.moye@huffingtonpost.com ><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/email-letter-icon.jpg > Contact The Author</a><br>  "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 20:19:28 -0500"	"comedy"

"Bumper Stickers, the Original Status Updates"	"Before status updates on social media, bumper stickers on cars acted as a person's semi-permanent status update. Growing up in a family who all drove Volvos, bumper stickers of the liberal variety would have been a perfect accoutrement to our vehicles. But adorning your Volvo with stickers was an unwritten  no no  in the Menachem household. Because of that, I admired the various messages people displayed.<br /> <br /> My first bumper sticker, was pushed on me by my kids. All the other parents had bumper stickers with the name of their Miami school, and so I agreed to conform. The sticker was low-key, and reminded me of a fancy boarding school logo. If I was creating an image of a preppy Boston mom, I did a great job (the bike racks helped to complete the image). Unfortunately, an issue continued to plague me after I branded my car with the Waldorf logo. Texts, phone calls and emails announcing my various activities began swarming in -- and only because with this sticker, I was easily recognized. The double parking, the crooked parking, the late night pizza eating...I was being watched. And that was the last of my personal relationship with a bumper sticker. But I really, and I'm talking really appreciate a good bumper sticker.<br /> <br /> What do I love? I love the passion in one's beliefs. I love the pride in one's kids. I love the faith in religion. I even love the self-righteousness. I love the comedy, even if the displayer is clueless. Mostly, I love the commitment. You see, I can't commit to a bumper sticker -- I'm a walking contradiction, and would need a dry erase board bumper sticker to keep up with my changing ideologies.<br /> <br /> Bumper stickers allow you to show off,  Harvard,   Yale,   Stanford  etc.. the issue here: do we know if the driver really attended this ivy-league school? Personally, I would love to slap a Harvard bumper sticker on the back of my car. All the other drivers will be impressed -- I mean I graduated from HARVARD!!!!   I'd rather be knitting,   I only eat carrots,   My other mode of transport is a kayak,   I'd rather be surfing  -- whatever the case, I'm impressed..because I wish I'd rather be surfing. But we all know my bumper sticker would say  I want to say I'd rather be surfing, but I'm a wimp and scared of drowning.  <br /> <br /> I do have some favorites....  I'm the Juan for you,   Real men love Jesus,   My boss is a Jewish carpenter  and the ultimate  stick figure family,  usually on the back of a mini-van.  Now, I don't know about other parents, but I try to hide my motherhood as much as possible on the road. Let the other drivers assume, the cool person with the wild hair, blasting Lauryn Hill is on her way to a photo shoot at Ben Harper's music studio or embarking on a road trip to meet her guru.  No need to draw attention.  And I hate to point this out, but if you're driving a mini-van, we all know you have offspring.  <br /> <br /> The stick figure family, while comedically entertaining, is not necessary.  I'm almost thinking a fake bumper sticker would be appropriate in this scenario -- I won't judge -- we know you would  rather be kayaking,  and that's why you have a mini-van to fit your large vessel.  <br /> <br /> So yesterday, I walked by a bumper sticker that made me laugh, considering my inner dialogue regarding the  stick figure family.   With no political statement or religious meaning, this bumper sticker was clear and simple,  Nobody cares about your stick figure family.  I'm not mean, but this really made me laugh.  I care about your family and I actually like learning about their various hobbies and interests, while I'm driving with my two assistants  (i.e. my kids) to a photo shoot.

"Timeless or New?  The ABCs of Marketing in a Digital Era"	"The explosion of digital platforms is causing many marketers to rethink how they engage with consumers. But sometimes in their hurry to embrace the digital world, companies often lose their way and forget the basic principles of good marketing and branding. We furtively deploy the latest or hottest digital innovation without fully considering the basics of brand strategy or message consistency. Consumers end up more confused and less loyal,  as I write in my latest book, <em>Twitter is Not a Strategy: Rediscovering the Art of Brand Marketing. <br /> </em><br /> I propose a strategy combining the best of both worlds: the 'new' of digital marketing with the tried and tested fundamentals of traditional branding. In this wide-ranging interview, adapted from an article originally posted in <em>Knowledge</em>, the magazine of the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, I address issues that keep marketers and brand owners awake at night. <br /> <br /> <strong>Q. In the late 1990s Hal Varian and Carl Shapiro said that the power of big brands would shrink due to better access to information. In recent times in a book titled Absolute Value, Itamar Simonson and Emanuel Rosen argue that brands are needed less when consumers can access information through reviews and expert opinions. To what extent do you think that traditional branding, as we know it, is on the decline? <br /> </strong><br /> A. If you measure it in terms of percentage of media spend, clearly digital is widening and traditional is declining. The crux of [my] book is the alignment between the new and the so-called traditional. If you take a look at traditional as media channels, then of course, it is going to be declining as the role of data increases. That decline could be inexorable, though it probably won't go beneath a certain asymptotic plain. On the other hand, if you take a look at traditional branding as message clarity, as positioning, as the role of brands in life, and as the need for a compelling proposition and brand idea that forges order across different channels conceptually and executionally, then this is more important now than ever before as different engagement platforms proliferate. If you define traditional branding as mass media, it's going to be less important now than before, and it's declining in importance. But if you define traditional advertising as the conceptual craftsmanship that we have traditionally associated with building marketing propositions and enduring brand relationships with consumers, that's more important now than ever before. <br /> <br /> The role of a brand is for loyalty. Loyalty allows you to charge a higher price. With so many options that consumers have access to and the transparency of prices, the ability to charge a price premium is more important than ever before. Both in terms of confusion elimination or minimization and also the loyalty question in an era of proliferating branded and cheap alternatives, branding--traditional brand building if you want to call it that--becomes more important than ever before. <br /> <br /> <strong>Q. We sometimes find that consumers are less loyal to brands. Where do you think this will leave the idea of branding? <br /> </strong><br /> A. That is the $64,000 question and I wholeheartedly reject it. All you have to ask yourself is: are there still products that people are willing to pay a premium for? That premium <em>ipso facto </em>is loyalty. When you think about brand loyalty, and declining brand loyalty, what you're talking about on the flip side is increased price sensitivity. So perhaps it's true, that as consumers evolve they become less brand loyal in some sectors, but more brand loyal in other sectors, as you scale the Maslowian hierarchy of needs, a cleaning detergent could be high involvement for you when you're relatively poor and you need clothes to shine. [But] as you move up, what you wear in terms of a brand, your car or your mobile phone becomes more high-involvement for you and more relevant to your life and you're willing to pay a higher price premium for that. In emerging markets, you have waves of consumers entering different phases of economic development, so there will always be new consumers. <br /> <br /> With urbanization in China people are owning homes or moving to cities for the first time. So their brand choices are high involvement and then there's loyalty. Societies are always evolving. Different segments of societies' engagement with different types of categories are always shifting as well. Even in the US--in the recession of 1989 everybody thought that generics would take over the store. They haven't because of the relationship that people have with categories and brands. So I don't quite buy it, but I will say certain pockets of commoditization do occur. <br /> <br /> <strong>Q. Some experts are saying that people are often 'product loyal' rather than 'brand loyal' and it's easy to confuse the two. Is that a differentiation that we need to be paying attention to? A. I disagree. I'm not saying that product attributes aren't critically important. We have to define our terms: what is a brand? <br /> </strong><br /> A brand is the role of a product in life and it is the relationship that a person has with a product. That relationship is forged through both product engagement, but also from a clear proposition that is in many cases passively received and actively defined by the manufacturer. When you are engaging with Apple, you are engaging with the Apple experience. Ultimately a brand is an experience. So if that experience is not only multidimensional, but also consistent, that experience becomes a holistic brand. Take Lego. It's not just the fact that you have blocks that makes Lego a strong brand. It's that you have a clearly defined brand idea, a relationship between the brand and consumer of inspiring builders of tomorrow. So every time you come into contact with that brand--whether it's Lego Land, the Lego movie, the Lego retail experience, or the Lego toy itself--then you are reinforcing a predefined relationship. <br /> <br /> Once you start defining a brand as a relationship, you stop talking as if the product and brand can be separated. They can't. The brand is a relationship that is an alignment of function, emotion and role in life, so that it's consistent. Of course if you don't have a strong and cohesive brand, then the product becomes very important. But that [would be] a very vulnerable product because people can simply out-innovate you very quickly. <br /> <br /> <strong>Q. In your book, you talk of 'brand indifference' and differences between the developed world vis-à-vis developing countries. What is that a function of, and how should big brands factor this into their strategies? <br /> </strong><br /> A. As consumers become wealthier and more able to digest communications and brand propositions, and less safety seeking and less in need of basic reassurance and reliability, they become more discriminating. That's a long-winded way of saying that because developed market consumers are more experienced in digesting brands, their standards of what a brand experience should be to result in satisfaction are probably more multidimensional. Then the question is: does that mean that they are less embracing of good brands? The answer is no. There is still a great deal of loyalty for brands that have a significant role in life. <br /> <br /> <strong>Q. The crux of your argument in the book is that the advent of digital marketing is creating a schism in marketing that is further hampering the development of brands. Where are you really coming from and why? <br /> </strong><br /> A. I see many clients and many industry people saying that the sky is falling. That there is a fundamental overturn caused by data. I see people increasingly immobilized. I don't want to say that it's sheer and utter chaos out there, but I feel there's less confidence in people in terms of defining their future both personally and on a brand and marketing level. In our industry (advertising agencies) there are people that say we're not creatives anymore, we're inventors. Many advertising agencies [have] defined their mission without any direct or indirect association with ideas. So there is a gap in knowledge that is very unsettling for many people, and we as human beings want to fill that knowledge gap. But in the process I see us disregarding anything that is abstract. Brands, and timeless brand building is ultimately conceptual craftsmanship. That is, I think, a little bit denigrated these days in relation to the digital engineering that is happening at the most innovative technology companies. I'm seeing a loss of confidence. <br /> <br /> <strong>Q. Can you give me an example of companies that have stepped too far away from the fundamentals of marketing into just a very extreme digital world? <br /> </strong><br /> A. What happens more often is you see lots of inconsistent messages. Inconsistency is often the fruit of an identity crisis. Adidas has lost its core message. A lot of Mercedes' digital activities have nothing to do with the core proposition. They're very tactical in targeting very direct and specific market targets for their specific variants or nameplates or sub-nameplates, but when you take a look at that versus BMW, BMW has maintained a much more cohesive brand idea across both broadcast and lean-back media and digital channels. In China Li-Ning's methods have shattered as a result of the advent of digital, as a result of the multichannel confusion. <br /> <br /> <strong>Q. Can you take an example of a brand and explain how they got it right? <br /> </strong><br /> A. If you look at Axe deodorant (known as Lynx in some countries like Australia and China), its brand idea is about irresistible attractiveness for the ordinary guy. The insight (or motivation) is that young men are not confident in their ability to attract young women; Axe gives you the confidence. That's usually how its creative is expressed on television. If you look at the digital engagement platforms, they have a 'sexy alarm clock': a guy can have a beautiful girl wake him up every day and remind him to wear Axe. You can join an online air hostess club, a Mile-High Club, which again can be built into a loyalty program as well. So you're taking from insight to brand idea to creative expression, then to engagement platform to digital and non-digital means, the exact same relationship with the brand. <br /> <br /> UNIQLO has an insight for Asians in particular that don't want to be defined by style, but want to have freedom in a framework. They want to be able to mix and match. So you have mix and match component clothing, and then you have a brand idea that is ultimately about your style, not ours. As you go into the digital platforms, you have a tick-tock clock called UNIQLOCK change your moves (UNIQLOCK is an online music and dance clock showing a four girls dancing wearing different combinations of UNIQLO clothes). It's reinforcing that same relationship? <br /> <br /> <strong>Q. What about brands that got it wrong--like Li-Ning? <br /> </strong><br /> A. Li-Ning has gone the wrong way not just for digital: but it has had several different, inconsistent brand ideas. It went from a Chinese-style play, then it went to 'Make the Change' for the post-90s generation. Now it's re-launching itself with another brand idea. So on the brand idea and execution level, it's always been very inconsistent. If you look at what it's done in terms of e-commerce, it has absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever. Its website has been very inconsistent as well. So Li-Ning is the ultimate fractionated brand, and as a result loyalty has dropped significantly. Anta used to have a follower position, now it's leading both in terms of volume and in terms of profit by a large margin. And Anta has made mistakes as well. It hasn't been a noble player either, but Li-Ning is just an example of a brand that has zigzagged for the last six or seven years, and has basically lost its credibility in the marketplace. <br /> <br /> <strong>Q. Why do brands go down that path in the first place? Is it because within the organization maybe traditional marketing is seen as a different silo versus what is seen as digital? <br /> </strong><br /> A. The fundamental issue is that in general--and I don't like using the word traditional--traditional marketing relies on lateral thinking. Digital marketing is much more analytic and linear. Corporations need to make great efforts to align a conceptual and a linear orientation. This difference could be further exacerbated structurally, though oftentimes digital and e-commerce would be in the domain of sales, whereas brand--particularly in Asia--is in the domain of marketing. Marketing is relatively unempowered relative to sales. The ultimate issue is corporate governance: the CEO [being] rewarded for long-term shareholder gains based on value propositions that yield higher profit. This type of leadership needs to be very strong and committed to brand building and the cohesion of a brand proposition. Unless he is, the structure of a corporation, the prominence of marketing relative to sales, where e-commerce comes into the proposition, where digital comes into the sales organization, whether it's just another channel or a new way of engaging with consumers, is something that is ultimately structural. <br /> <br /> <strong>Q. You have been in Asia for about 20 years. In your opinion, how evolved are Asian companies when it comes to these issues that you're talking about? <br /> </strong><br /> A. Depending on the country, there's a broad spectrum of sensitivity towards the value of brands, as we define them in developed markets. Japan is very non-embracing of brands for fundamentally cultural reasons. They define brands as two things: innovation and scale. But when it comes to an explicit definition of what a brand proposition or brand idea is, this violates some cultural tendencies: it's a very implicit culture where things are not expressed overtly. So the need in a highly harmonious society, that is relatively isolated, to define for the benefit of people who are not of the culture what a brand proposition is, is not fundamental. If you move into China, Korea and other Confucian countries, the acceptance of a brand and what it can do for pragmatic purposes is huge. Just to give you an example, our revenue in J. Walter Thompson China is at least 45% from local companies. In Japan it's been a much harder road to hoe. Chinese companies know that a brand is useful. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the structure of companies doesn't let them pass through the inflection point required for consistency. And that gets back to the structural issues: the emperor is a CEO managing not just long-term shareholder gain, but the political imperatives. Therefore he is a defensive leader, a more fear-driven leader. So there are silos and Balkanization that keep the brand from being a unifying force. You've got a lot of people that want to have brands as we know them in developed markets, but are not able to implement the framework operationally. Again, the most basic manifestation of this is sales, which is concrete, being more powerful in every respect than marketing, which is considered a little trifling. In Southeast Asia the companies are not as evolved as brand producers, but there is a much more easy embrace of it. So when you do company training, people get it over there. Again, I think that there's a scale issue that has precluded that from coming together. India, of course, is very brand sensitive, because Indians are great conceptualizers.

While there have been vast improvements in infant-mortality rates and smoking rates over the last several decades, the United States still struggles with obesity and diabetes in particular. Last year, the nation’s obesity rate increased to 29.4% of adults from 27.6% the year before.<br /> <br /> The United Health Foundation’s 2014 Health Rankings report examined both determinants and health outcomes. It included such factors as healthy behaviors, quality of health care, health policy, the presence of diseases and deaths from illnesses across the nation. Health varies considerably between states. Based on this year’s edition of America’s Health Rankings, Hawaii and Mississippi are once again the healthiest and least healthy states.<br /> <br /> Negative health outcomes were far less common in the healthiest states than in the least healthy ones. The prevalence of diabetes has increased dramatically in the United States in recent years, due in part to rising obesity rates. In all of the healthiest states, the rates of diabetes were less than the national rate of nearly 10% of adults. In addition, the majority of the healthiest states were also among the 10 states with the fewest cardiovascular deaths per 100,000 people.<br /> <br /> The cost of poor health can be measured in years of life. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks premature deaths, as measured by the number of years lost when people do not live to age 75. This year, the CDC estimated that nearly 7,000 years were lost for every 100,000 Americans. This figure was lower in all of the healthiest states, one of which, Massachusetts, led the nation with 5,345 estimated years lost per 100,000 people.<br /> <br /> Healthy behavior and lifestyle is also a major contributor to good health. According to Dr. Rhonda Randall, the chief medical officer for the United Retiree Solutions and a senior advisor to the United Health Foundation, the United States has tackled issues like infant mortality and smoking cessation. And “we can do that with physical inactivity and obesity. Those are things that are completely within our control,” Randall said. Less than 75% of Americans reported regular physical activity. In nine of the least healthy states, however, less than 70% of people exercised regularly.<br /> <br /> Money and employment also clearly play roles in determining health. The healthiest states are often among the nation’s wealthiest, and each had a median household income above the national median in 2013. All but one of the healthiest states also had a lower unemployment rate than the national rate of 7.4% last year. Low unemployment rates improve the likelihood of receiving health insurance, as many Americans are covered through their work. All of the healthiest states also had better coverage rates than the national coverage rate. And in three of the 10 states, the percentage of residents without health coverage was less than half the national figure of 14.6%.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://247wallst.com/special-report/2014/12/12/americas-most-and-least-healthy-states-2/2/  target= _hplink >Click here to see America’s Most (and Least) Healthy States</a><br /> <br /> Yet, according to Randall, “We know that just having health insurance isn’t enough. It’s also access to care, and making good decisions for our lifestyle choices, and then the quality of clinical care we receive when we do access the health care system.” When it comes to the quality of clinical care, once again, the healthiest states stood out. Six of these 10 states were among the top 10 nationally for the concentration of primary care physicians, and Massachusetts had more than 200 doctors for every 100,000 residents, the highest figure in the country.<br /> <br /> Randall went on to say that health really needs to be understood broadly. “It’s not just about whether you get the right care, or when you go to see your doctor, it’s also about the environment with which we live.” Environment, in this case, includes both promoting strong education and a safe environment. Ninth graders had relatively low chances of graduating high school in many of the of the least healthy states, for example. Additionally, the violent crime rates in many of these states were far higher than the national rate of 387 incidents per 100,000 people.<br /> <br /> Public policy is yet another contributor. While the United States spent $90 per capita on public health services, several of the healthiest states — Hawaii, Vermont, Massachusetts, and North Dakota — spent more than $100 per resident. Yet, a majority of the healthiest states actually spent less per capita on public health than the nation as a whole. Randall explained that “public health spending is an important measure, which is why we included it. But, it’s also important how effective the programs are that the money is used for… It is multifaceted.”<br /> <br /> Based on data provided by United Health Foundation’s America’s Health Rankings, 24/7 Wall St. examined the 10 states with the highest and lowest overall scores. These scores were based on a number of measures that fall into two separate categories: health determinants and health outcomes. Determinants were further divided into behaviors, such as smoking, community and environmental factors, such as children living in poverty; policy factors, such as public health funding and immunization rates; and clinical care factors, such as the availability of dentists and doctors. Outcomes included rates of death from cancer and cardiovascular diseases, as well as infant mortality rates.

"Ted Cruz Mocks GOP Leaders, Sparks Marathon Weekend Session On Spending Bill"	"WASHINGTON -- The Senate is all but guaranteed to pass a $1.1 trillion grab-bag funding bill to keep the government open. But the effort to pass the bill has been fraught with drama, as a simmering feud between Republican leaders and the conservative wing of their party led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sparked an unusual weekend voting marathon Saturday.<br /> <br /> It all started Friday evening when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) rejected an offer from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to push ahead with the funding bill, as well as measures that extend expiring tax breaks and the federally backed terrorism insurance program. <br /> <br /> Reid objected because he also wanted to approve about 20 of President Barack Obama’s nominees before the Senate left session.<br /> <br /> The resulting arrangement was that the Senate would approve a short stopgap funding bill on Friday, take a break, then finish most remaining business by Monday night, including the controversial funding bill that will keep the government running through September.<br /> <br /> McConnell even left the Capitol around 9 p.m,, telling reporters he’d see them Monday.<br /> <br /> But soon thereafter, Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) headed to the Senate floor and objected, blocking the short stopgap and forcing the chamber into session on Saturday. The two conservative senators are demanding a vote on a point of order, raised by Cruz, that questions the validity of the entire spending bill. The move is an effort to object to President Barack Obama's executive action sparing up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.<br /> <br /> Cruz questioned whether America should trust McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to follow through on their pledges to fight Obama on immigration. The two leaders convinced their members not to use the funding measure for battles over immigration or the Affordable Care Act. Boehner and McConnell got Republicans to agree to fund most of the government, but leave the Department of Homeland Security with only enough cash to run through February, at which time the leaders promised to challenge Obama’s immigration orders.<br /> <br /> “I take them at their word because the alternative would be that elected leaders were saying something to the American people they don't believe, and they don't intend to follow through on,” Cruz said during a long floor speech. <br /> <br /> But, he added, “I would note that a whole lot of citizens across this country feel a little bit like Charlie Brown with Lucy and the football, where in fight after fight leadership in Congress says, ‘We'll fight next time -- not this time, no, no, no. The wise thing to do is to fight in a month, fight in two months, fight in thee months.  <br /> <br /> “There comes a point when Charlie Brown has kicked the football and fallen on his rear end one too many times,  Cruz said.<br /> <br /> While Reid had hoped for a break, Lee blocked that plan, saying, “I don’t see any reason why the United States Senate should suspend its operations while the American people are waiting for us to act.”<br /> <br /> Ironically, Cruz and Lee's objections actually sped of the process of passing the funding bill. Without the break, the Senate will hold its final procedural vote on the spending bill around 1 a.m. Sunday, then pass it Monday at about 7 a.m.<br /> <br /> Cruz said his goal was to put senators on the record as to whether or not they support Obama’s “illegal amnesty.”<br /> <br /> Reid and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) made sure to highlight Cruz and Lee's mini-revolt when they opened up Saturday's vote-a-rama. The Democratic senators noted that Cruz was mostly criticizing members of his own party, the same way he did last year before leading fellow conservatives in a push to defund Obamacare, which resulted in a government shutdown.<br /> <br /> “I might just ask the majority leader, this is the same senator who shut down the government last year in protest over the Affordable Care Act?  Durbin asked Reid in a brief colloquy.<br /> <br /> “The very same man,  Reid responded.  Now he's hung up on not only the Affordable Care Act, but the president's action to give 5 million people relief in this country so they can come out of the shadows and make this country a more productive place. <br /> <br /> The spending bill is also being criticized from the left, with a group of lawmakers led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) complaining about provisions that allow wealthy donors to give even more money to political parties and ease the Dodd-Frank bill's restrictions on banks making risky trades.<br /> <br /> Funding for the government is set to run out at midnight Saturday, but the House of Representatives has already passed a separate measure that authorizes spending until Wednesday. The Senate can pass that whenever it needs to, as long as none of its members object. <br /> <br /> <strong>UPDATE</strong>, 4:00 p.m. -- The Senate passed the stopgap funding by unanimous consent Saturday afternoon, giving it until Wednesday to pass full funding.<br /> <br /> <strong>UPDATE</strong>, 10:30 p.m. -- Cruz and Lee relented, letting the Senate vote on the  cromnibus  Saturday night, but they lost the vote on their point of order, 22 to 74, and the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/13/cromnibus-senate_n_6321144.html  target= _hplink >funding passed</a>.<br /> <br /> <br /> <em>Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.

"Predicting the Success of Design Driven Startups"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-markettechnologyexecution.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-13-markettechnologyexecution.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-markettechnologyexecution-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 394  /></a><br /> <br /> In stark contrast to previous decades, starting a new venture can be accomplished on a shoestring budget. This is due to the diminishing cost of information and tools combined with the relatively high value of knowledge, skills and experience that founders bring to the equation. Bootstrapping is now often possible up to Round A Financing. This is where capital is required for marketing to scale rapidly and New Product Development is required to deliver high quality offerings.<br /> <br /> Starting a design driven entrepreneurial venture requires a passionate belief, risk-attitude, adaptability, human and social capital as well as true grit ( never, never give up ). However, with most entrepreneurial endeavors failing, there most likely will come a point when, despite pivoting the business model multiple times and accumulating sunk cost, the best course of action is simply to leave the table and pursue other opportunities.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/217843  target= _hplink >A Harvard Study</a> of Venture Capital funded startups show that eighteen percent of first time startups fail. Serial entrepreneurs do somewhat better; with first time failing firms succeeding twenty percent of the time and successful firms succeeding thirty percent of the time, the second time around.<br /> <br /> Setting out to predict startup performance and the likelihood of success, we joined forces with Stanford's Studio for Venture Design, Art Center College of Design -- The Design Accelerator and Innovate Pasadena. Observing over sixty startups in Silicon Valley and San Gabriel Valley, as well as, fifty entrepreneurial teams at Hanyang University in Seoul, Korea, and Cal State University, Long Beach, California, we found three reliable predictors for Design Execution performance: <br /> <br /> - Supporting Philosophy<br /> - Design Expression<br /> - Technology Risk<br /> <br /> These three parameters were found to capture sixty-five percent of the variability in the observed performance.<br /> <br /> From an investor point of view, assessing design execution performance, in turn, allows these investors to determine the combined market risk, technology risk and design execution risk. Multiplying these individual risks will help to optimize a portfolio of potential ventures.<br /> <br /> From a startup perspective, knowing the design execution performance risk and the market technology risk, enables startups to adjust their market - technology position. It also can assist them to pivot or to systematically improve their design execution process.<br /> <br /> There are three ventures situations highlighted within the introduction map to this article:<br /> <br /> Venture  A  is positioned in low market risk and high technology risk, combined with a strong Design Execution (3.87 or 84% proficiency). The strategy could be to keep up the performance and secure sufficient investment to finance the expensive and often long term development process.<br /> <br /> Venture  B  is positioned in low market risk and low technology risk, however displays a weak Design Execution (2.44 or 53% proficiency). The strategy could be to take on additional technology risk by exploring alternative technologies while improving design execution performance.<br /> <br /> Venture  C  is positioned in medium market risk and high technology risk, displaying a medium Design Execution (3.37 or 74% proficiency). The strategy could be to improve design execution performance and reassess the extreme technology risk.<br /> <br /> Of course, there is much more to a startups success than market, technology and design execution, including team dynamics, the competitive field, surrounding ecosystem and the intellectual property conditions.<br /> <br /> Still, with failure rates hovering between seventy to eighty-two percent of startups who received VC funding, knowing where one is from a Market, Technology and Design Execution perspective goes a long way toward deciding whether to fold one's tent or to mitigate the inherent risk and improve the performance deficiencies.

"Cause Marketing: It's All About Planning and Relationships"	"Cause marketing in the digital age has never been easier (or harder). In one sense, there are a plethora of social platforms that offer a seemingly endless audience. On the other hand, managing campaigns across social can seem like herding cats; there's so much to do, and so much noise that the process can seem overwhelming.<br /> <br /> However, just like any other marketing (digital or otherwise), success always boils down to relationships. Developing relationships with partner businesses... developing relationships with donors... and keeping those relationships going beyond the campaign.<br /> <br /> While there are a number of examples of charities that have raised millions for their causes using social, such as the American Heart Association, American Red Cross and Save the Children, many cause organizations shrink from it because it just seems too complicated. It doesn't have to be--but you do need a plan. Kathryn Rose, my friend and co-author of my book Return on Relationship has a saying she's fond of using when she speaks to organizations about using social media: Planless = Penniless. And I totally agree. Before you jump in with guns blazing, get your ducks in a row first.<br /> <br /> Mashable published an article back in 2010 entitled 8 Tips for a Successful Social Media Cause Campaign, and these tips make a great outline for your plan:<br /> <br /> 1.     Create a Strong Theme with Clear Goals<br /> <br /> 2.     Seek a Non-Profit Partner that's Active in Social Media<br /> <br /> 3.     Connect the Theme, Sponsor and Non-Profit<br /> <br /> 4.     Identify and Utilize Your Best Social Assets<br /> <br /> 5.     Target a Well-Defined Audience<br /> <br /> 6.     Energize and Motivate Your Supporters<br /> <br /> 7.     Pay Attention to Timing<br /> <br /> 8.     Follow Up<br /> <br /> Read the article and you'll see that the underlying thread to building a successful plan is the relationships you build along the way. Using social tools to connect with people who share your concerns, sharing relevant information and content, showing people the specific impact of contributions with socially-compelling visual content (videos and photos), maintaining transparency--all these things help you build and nurture the relationships that further the cause.<br /> <br /> And it doesn't matter which part of the plan you're developing. The main thing to keep in mind is how to use the platforms and tools at your disposal to reach out, connect and communicate. Whether you're chatting with people in Twitter or Facebook, sharing compelling photos and videos using Instagram, or reaching out to potential business partners on LinkedIn, always drive your efforts from your audience's perspective. That means you'll have to listen on those channels to see what kinds of information your audience wants (and what they don't want), but that's OK. Every platform has tools you can use to for listening and researching as well. Use them.<br /> <br /> It doesn't matter if your cause is a children's charity, animal welfare or disaster response, either. Humans are innately generous and love to get behind efforts where they feel they can make a difference--you just need to get in front of them. The beauty of social as a communication medium is that it allows anyone to make connections at scale--something that evens the playing field for small and large organizations alike. You don't need a billion dollar budget to raise money anymore. Just Google  Social Media for Cause Marketing,  and you'll see hundreds of case studies of organizations that have been successful on a shoestring.<br /> <br /> Just remember to plan your campaign wisely, and  think relationships  at every stage. That's how you develop the kind of  Return on Relationship  that builds a solid return for your cause and enables you to give it legs for the future. "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 13:42:30 -0500"	"business"
"How Countries Around The World Are Coping With Falling Oil Prices"	"<em>Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we look at the impact of a steep decline in oil prices.</em><br /> <br /> On Friday, the price of benchmark crude oil dropped to new <a href= http://finance.yahoo.com/news/brent-hits-five-half-low-034420232.html  target= _hplink >five-year lows</a>. <br /> <br /> The price of oil has been plummeting for months, leaving oil-producing nations around the world <a href= http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-30/oil-at-40-possible-as-market-transforms-caracas-to-iran.html  target= _hplink >aghast</a> at their sinking revenues. Poor global economic growth has cut demand, while the U.S. is producing oil <a href= http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-11/wti-trades-near-61-as-saudis-question-need-for-production-cut.html  target= _hplink >faster than ever recorded</a>.  <br /> <br /> Prices fell further last month after Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies <a href= http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/28/us-opec-meeting-idUSKCN0JA0O320141128  target= _hplink >blocked an effort </a>at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce production levels in order to boost the price of oil.<br /> <br /> The OPEC episode shows that it's not only economists and oil barons who are concerned about the price crash. Many major oil producers are embroiled in domestic and international political crises, and political analysts are <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/12/03/falling-oil-prices-more-peace/  target= _hplink >watching closely</a> to see how these countries react as revenues continue to decline. Iran, <a href= http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/12/1394-budget-iran-economy.html  target= _hplink >struggling</a> to balance its budget amid falling prices and international sanctions, this week <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/iran-oil-prices_n_6302160.html  target= _hplink >blamed</a> longtime rival Saudi Arabia for a “conspiracy against the interests of the region.” Russia recently <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/02/russia-recession_n_6255810.html  target= _hplink >warned</a> that it will fall into recession in 2015. <br /> <br /> “Optimists think economic pain may make these countries more amenable to international pressure,” The Economist <a href= http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/12/economist-explains-4  target= _hplink >explains</a>. “Pessimists fear that when cornered, they may lash out in desperation.”<br /> <br /> The WorldPost spoke to <a href= https://sipa.columbia.edu/faculty/jason-bordoff  target= _hplink >Jason Bordoff</a>, director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, about the political fallout of declining oil revenues around the world.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why did Saudi Arabia reject production cuts at the OPEC meeting?</strong><br /> <br /> Saudi Arabia has two options: They can cut their own production and therefore lose revenue and market share, or they can just let the price fall, thinking that the higher cost of production leads to a drop in supply on its own. Saudi Arabia is signaling that if OPEC needs to cut production levels, they want other exporters who are not members of OPEC to cut their production as well.<br /> <br /> What’s changed fundamentally in the market in the last few years is the dramatic increase in U.S. oil production. There are few other instances in history when oil production has grown so quickly. I think we’re still learning a lot about U.S. oil production. Other oil producers are opting to wait and see what happens, and then take a decision. <br /> <br /> Often in the past, OPEC has only agreed to production cuts after a few meetings and an increased sense of panic. It is certainly possible that the oil price will decline further and U.S. production will keep growing, and OPEC will have to take action. <br /> <br /> <strong>If the price keeps falling, could this backfire on the Saudi regime by undermining stability in the country?</strong><br /> <br /> Saudi Arabia has very costly social programs and welfare spending. I imagine the Saudi regime is concerned about the possibility of instability. But they are in a better position than other producers. They have huge financial reserves. If they decide to run a deficit for a while, they could handle it.<br /> <br /> <strong>What about the other major oil-producing nations?</strong><br /> <br /> There are very significant risks to the stability of these countries. Nigeria and Venezuela are going to be in an extremely painful position over the next year. Their economies have already suffered. Venezuela supports a subsidized oil price for regional allies, which is pushing them towards the risk of default.<br /> <br /> <strong>Do you think trouble in the oil markets could pressure Iran to reach a deal over its nuclear program, or curb Russia's military ambitions?</strong><br /> <br /> Russia is facing extreme pressure from the price collapse as well as international sanctions. The ruble has already fallen sharply. Iran is also suffering from sanctions as well as the oil price. I hope the low price will provide an opportunity for the West to exert greater leverage to push for agreement with Iran and Russia, but it's hard to say how these countries will respond. <br /> <br /> As Iran continues to negotiate with the international community over its nuclear program, the sharp fall in the price of oil is an additional reason for accommodating sooner rather than later. The flip side is that the lower oil price could make it easier for the U.S. Congress to ratchet up sanctions on Iran. <br /> <br /> [Russian President] Vladimir Putin has shown much less willingness to move forward. I don’t think that we’ve seen signals that he will pull back from aggression in Ukraine. His popularity remains high despite the economic pain. <br /> <br /> <strong>What do you expect to happen next to the price of oil?</strong><br /> <br /> It’s very hard to predict. If you had asked me two months ago I would not have predicted where we are today. <br /> <br /> I don't think we’re yet at the bottom price. It will fall further, and then begin picking back up again in the next year. I think demand will pick up because of the lower price, and supply will grow less quickly. But how fast it will rise, and to what level, is hard to say.<br /> <br /> <em>This interview has been edited for clarity.</em> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 11:27:05 -0500"	"business"
"So That Happened, Episode 13: CIA Torture Report Was Chronicle Of Depravity And Incompetence"	"<strong>So, <em>that</em> happened:</strong> This week, a summary of the Senate's report on CIA torture was released into the wild, and while the redactions were thick, it nevertheless read as a thoroughgoing chronicle of depravity and incompetence that will, at the very least, ruin hummus forever. National security reporter Ali Watkins is here to walk us through the report. <br /> <br /> <strong>Listen to this week's  So <em>That</em> Happened  below:</strong><br /> <br /> <center><iframe width= 100%  height= 166  scrolling= no  frameborder= no  src= https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/181259939&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false ></iframe></center><br /> <br /> <center>*   *   *</center><br /> <br /> <strong>Some highlights from this week:</strong><br /> <br /> <strong> It plays into every stereotype you think of with the CIA. Something's going okay and then like a bull in a china shop, they bust in there. <em>-- Ali Watkins</em></strong><br /> <br /> Not to mention that ...<br /> <br /> <strong> You put all this together and you remember that this was supposed to be about protecting America.  To me, it seems to represent a huge opportunity cost to protecting America. All this wasted time, all this wasted effort and what do we have to show for it? <em>-- Jason Linkins</em></strong><br /> <br /> Meanwhile, last week we introduced you to the cromnibus -- the lame-duck budget bill that needed to be passed to keep the government working. This week, legislators got lathered up about a Wall Street poison pill that came along with the bill, leading to new fractures and strange alliances that may come to define the legislative fights ahead. <br /> <br /> <strong> Obama ended up getting his policy and Wall Street got their policy. But Obama looks terrible. He looks like the guy who is in bed with Jamie Dimon and John Boehner. Elizabeth Warren looks like the populist folk hero who stood up and tried to keep this from hitting mainstream consumers.  <em>-- Zach Carter</em></strong><br /> <br /> And speaking of the cromnibus, the bill also contained language that may scuttle the efforts of the District of Columbia to decriminalize weed. It's another blow to a group of Americans who have never had fair representation in Congress.<br /> <br /> <strong> If D.C. officials fight this as aggressively as it seems like they're willing to do, it will put Republican leaders in the House in the position of having to affirmatively thwart the local law.  <em>-- Arthur Delaney</em></strong><br /> <br /> <center>*   *   *</center><br /> <br /> We're very happy to let you know that  So, <i>That</i> Happened  is <a href= https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/so-that-happened/id945384774  target= _hplink >now available on iTunes</a>.

"For 'The Interview,' Even Negative Publicity (Like A Massive Sony Hack) Is Good Publicity"	"Some bad news for Sony might end up being good news for one of the company's movies. <br /> <br /> A <a href= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/topic/sony-hack  target= _hplink >massive hack</a> of Sony Pictures Entertainment's computer system has been devastating to the studio, leading to leaks of unreleased movies, <a href= http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/12/11/sony-hack-execs-make-racist-jokes-about-barack-obama-listers-slam-those/  target= _hplink >embarrassing emails</a> and <a href= http://time.com/3625392/the-7-most-outrageous-things-we-learned-from-the-sony-hack/  target= _hplink >sensitive employee information</a>. But it has also brought a lot of attention to  The Interview,  the movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that some say prompted the hack. The film, due for release on Christmas Day, has become the topic of <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/world/asia/north-korea-warns-us-over-film-parody.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >countless news stories</a> and social media chatter, likely widening the movie's potential audience. <br /> <br />  It's creating a buzz,  said Steven Fink, who wrote <em>Crisis Management: Planning for the Inevitable</em>.  Wouldn't you want to see what all the hype is about?  <br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788710/  target= _hplink >In the film</a>, Rogen and Franco's characters work for a TV show and score an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. They are recruited by the CIA to assassinate him. Investigators <a href= http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/us-sony-cybersecurity-fbi-idUSKBN0JN1MF20141209?feedType=RSS&  target= _hplink >haven't determined who hacked Sony</a>, but many <a href= http://www.thewrap.com/sony-hack-attack-cybersecurity-firm-says-if-north-korea-was-involved-an-insider-helped/  target= _hplink >suspect</a> North Korean might have been involved, perhaps as retaliation for the film. A North Korean official has <a href= http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30366449  target= _hplink >denied</a> government involvement. <br /> <br /> From Nov. 20 to Dec. 3, a period that includes the first public news of the hack on Nov. 24, views of  The Interview  trailers were up 895 percent from the Nov. 6-19 period, according to data from Tubular Labs, a YouTube analytics company. Sony released a second trailer for the movie during that period as well, which like explains some of the spike in interest. <br /> <br /> But, in its first week, views of the second trailer far outpaced views of second trailers for other Sony movies, indicating the hack could have boosted interest in  The Interview,  according to Tubular. The second trailer for  The Interview  garnered 2.2 million views in its first week, while second trailers for  The Wedding Ringer  and  Annie  reached 815,000 and 400,100 views, respectively, in their first week.<br /> <br /> Allison Stern, the co-founder of Tubular, said  The Interview  content has been around for six months but one-third of the views on it came in the past month -- definitely a  bump  from the expected growth rate.<br /> <br /> Data from Google Trends also suggest the controversy has increased interest in the film:<br /> <br /> <img alt= google trends  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2382160/original.jpg  /><br /> <div style= width:570;font-size:70%; ><center><em>This chart from Google Trends shows the dips and spikes of Google searches for  The Interview.   Birdman,  by comparison, has a less-volatile search history. Sony also released a new trailer for  The Interview  after the hack was publicly known, which likely explains part of the spike in interest. In comparison, the first spike for  Birdman  occurred when its trailer was released and the larger spike happened when the movie opened.</em></center></div><br /> <br /> There's a long history of controversy propelling films, TV shows, books and albums to greater popularity. There's a reason the phrase  there's no such thing as bad publicity  exists. Bad book reviews can actually boost sales by an average of 45 percent if the author is relatively unknown, according to <a href= https://hbr.org/2012/03/bad-reviews-can-boost-sales-heres-why  target= _hplink >a 2012 study</a> from researchers at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford Graduate School of Business.<br /> <br /> Fink, the crisis-management expert, recalled the release of  The China Syndrome,  a 1979 film in which Jane Fonda played a reporter who convinces an engineer to blow the whistle on a dangerous nuclear power plant. The movie opened 12 days before the infamous Three Mile Island nuclear accident. <br /> <br />  I was ecstatic that it was extremely commercially successful,  <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/magazine/16wwln-freakonomics-t.html  target= _hplink >Fonda said of the film in an interview</a> on a retrospective edition of the DVD, according to a 2007 New York Times report.  You know the expression 'We had legs'? We became a caterpillar after Three Mile Island. <br /> <br /> The monthslong controversy over Mel Gibson's 2004 movie  The Passion of the Christ  that included allegations of anti-Semitism likely helped the film earn more than $23 million on its opening day. One of the movie's more prominent detractors, Rabbi Eugene Korn, the former head of interfaith affairs at the Anti-Defamation League, <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/28/arts/agreed-all-the-publicity-is-a-triumph-for-passion.html  target= _hplink >told a 2004 panel</a> that he and other critics made a  strategic error  by arguing over the film in public for so long before its release, the Times reported at the time.  <br /> <br /> Celebrity deaths can have a similar effect. Shortly after actor Heath Ledger died in 2008, sales of his movies spiked and more than 7 million fans raced to YouTube to watch trailers of  The Dark Knight,  the actor's last completed project, <a href= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/2008-01-25-299950782_x.htm  target= _hplink >The Associated Press reported at the time</a>.<br /> <br />  Anything like that happens, it makes you want to go see [the movie],  said Jeff Greenfield, the co-founder of C3 Metrics, a media analytics firm.  It just shows that people tend to like and get attracted to things that are negative.   <br /> <br /> <img alt= the interview movie  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2384876/original.jpg  /><div style= width:570;font-size:70%; ><center><em>Movie posters at the premiere of  The Interview  in Los Angeles earlier this month.</em></center></div><br /> <br /> Of course, any increase in box office sales for the film probably won't outweigh the consequences of the hack for Sony, said Mikey Glazer, a columnist for entertainment website The Wrap. A Sony representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. <br /> <br />  I'm sure it's not something they wished for,  Glazer said. <br /> <br /> One party may get a surprising benefit, though.  In some twisted way, this movie is actually wonderful for North Korea because it makes them out to be a superpower -- at least fictionally -- that the U.S. feels is worthy of assassination,  said Jason Maloni, a senior vice president at crisis communications firm Levick.

"Women in Business Q&A: Koren Ray, Hobo"	"<em>Koren Ray, an American leather goods designer, mother, philanthropist, and business woman was born in Maryland in 1966. Koren and her future husband David Brewer, along with her mother Toni Ray, founded <a href= http://www.hobobags.com  target= _hplink >Hobo</a>, a handbag and small leather goods company in 1991.  Over twenty years later, Hobo has grown into an internationally acclaimed women's accessories brand, sold to more than 3,000 retailers worldwide. Koren's design philosophy combines creativity, quality, function and style into every Hobo product. Stirred by the sublime and unexpected, influenced by both the old and the new, Koren finds much of her design inspiration while exploring the rich cultural heritage of Americana.  Her motto,  cool is when vintage meets modern,  permeates all of her hard work, positioning Hobo as America's foremost fun and funky accessories brand.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?</strong><br /> Ever since I was very young, I've watched my mother, Toni Ray, as she faced the challenges of running a business, as a woman and as a single mother. When I was little I spent a lot of weekends at her leather retail store, watching as she ran her business with passion and conviction and treated those who worked for her with respect, honesty, humility and humor. <br /> <br /> Once we started Hobo, and I had the opportunity to work along side her every day, I understood much better what it takes to begin a business from nothing and how to sustain the growth. In particular, building a strong company has everything to do with the people you bring on board; how you encourage them to work to their greatest potential and how you get them to stay. I believe strongly in the culture that my mother created in the early years of Hobo. She lead by example, demonstrating that she wasn't afraid to roll up her sleeves and take risks, even when we were a small company with everything to loose. Today, my husband, David Brewer, and I run the business with the same principles. We encourage our staff to take risks and challenge the expected. Our confidence in their efforts breeds a collective passion that is great for the brand. After years of admiring my mother's leadership, I can only hope to follow with the same integrity, grace and grit, <br />  <br /> <strong>How has your previous employment experience aided your positions at Hobo?</strong><br /> The truth is, I grew up at Hobo. In 1990, I had just graduated from Northwestern University when my mother was fired from the her job. At 50, she knew no one would hire her. She had to start out on her own. So she called me to help out for awhile. In 23 years, I have held nearly every position at Hobo; from sales calls, to packing and shipping orders, from laying out ads to designing handbags, my career at Hobo has been rich and diverse and has provided me with the global perspective I need to help guide the company's growth. <br />  <br /> <strong>What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenures at Hobo?</strong><br /> We started Hobo on the dining table with the last of my mother's IRA money. So in the beginning the challenges were many; how to pay the bills, how to save the business when our first shipment of handbags came in discolored. But through hard work and lots of luck, we turned those challenges into highlights. Our first big order from Nordstrom gave us the boost we needed. And setting up our corporate showrooms in New York, LA and Atlanta gave us the exposure we needed to see more growth. <br />  <br /> More recently, the challenges we face, like so many companies today, is how to stay relevant, competitive and important to consumers in this new economy. We overcome these challenges by creating buzz about the brand with highlights like our Hobo flagship store in downtown Annapolis, a newly updated Hobo retail website and our innovative Mobile Hobo fashion truck, all of which allow us great opportunities to reach customers with our brand message. <br />                <br /> <strong>What advice can you offer women who are seeking to start their own business?</strong><br /> Be willing to make sacrifices and be ready to switch gears quickly when your first ideas don't work. <br />                <br /> <strong>How do you maintain a work/life balance?</strong><br /> It's not always easy, but I believe it's about understanding and accepting that you can't do it alone. I am very fortunate to be married to my best friend and business partner, David Brewer. It helps to have someone who is working towards the same goals. Hobo is our passion, but family always comes first. Even my mother, who is the most driven person I've ever known, once said to me, when I was letting work get the better of me,  Honey, they're only handbags . It's good to have people in your life who can help you keep it all in perspective. <br />  <br /> <strong>What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?</strong><br /> Being raised by a single mother who started her own business from nothing, twice, I saw how women pressure themselves to do it all, and often carry a great deal of guilt while doing it. Today I think it's important that women know it's OK to want it all; career, family, friends, goals, but at the same time, it's OK to admit you can't do it all alone. <br />  <br /> <strong>How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal lives?</strong><br /> All of my life, my mother has been my greatest mentor. Even before I was old enough to truly appreciate her, she was a source of strength for me. As a single mom, running her own business, before women even did that, she always gave 150% to whatever she did. I learned from her that you get out of life exactly what you put in. As I got older and began to appreciate her more, I saw that she ran her businesses the same way she led her life; be honest, work hard, be real and fair and follow your heart. Her lessons serve me well in every aspect of my life, running Hobo and raising my own family. <br />  <br /> <strong>Which other female leaders do you admire and why?</strong><br /> There are a great many women I admire, from all professions, for their strength of conviction and their selfless efforts. They are setting powerful examples for us all. But honestly, my true heroes, are the real women I meet everyday. They are raising children, caring for family and friends, working their jobs and with every contribution, big or small, they are shaping the world. <br />  <br /> <strong>What do you want Hobo to accomplish in the next year?</strong><br /> One of our big goals for the next year is the successful relaunch of our hobobags.com e-commerce website. We have brought a whole new lifestyle experience to the site and we are thrilled to be moving all of the order fulfillment and customer service from a third party contractor to our own corporate distribution center in-house. We are continually looking for ways to better communicate with our direct consumer and we think the new website will be a great tool. <br />  <br /> We are also excited to be getting our new Mobile Hobo fashion truck out on the road. We've taken an old delivery truck and refitted the inside to showcase our products. A mobile truck is perfect for Hobo. It's a reflection of our adventurous spirit and great way for us to take our brand message on the road. "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 07:15:44 -0500"	"business"
"Winter Is Apparently The Best Time To Sell Your Home. Here's How To Prep It In One Weekend."	"Winter is known for many things, the least of which may be that it's the best season to sell a home. Granted, winter isn't <a href= http://moving.about.com/od/preparingforyourmove/a/best_time_move.htm  target= _hplink >exactly the most convenient time to move</a>, but according to a study from real estate company <a href= https://www.redfin.com/  target= _hplink >Redfin</a>, <a href= https://www.redfin.com/about/press/releases/Redfin-Report-Reveals-Homes-Listed-in-Winter-Sell-Faster  target= _hplink >homes listed between December and March sell faster than homes listed in other months, and for more money</a>. (That's been the case recent years, at least -- the market changes often).<br /> <br /> Redfin says that anytime between December and May is an ideal time to list your home -- and February is the hands-down the best month. The company's analysis of nationwide listings from 2014 showed that 74 percent of homes listed in February sold within 90 days, and 13 percent of them sold for more than the list price. (Compare that to September, when 61 percent of homes sold within 90 days and October, when just five percent sold above list price). <br /> <br /> In short,  shoppers in January and February are motivated,  says Christin Camacho, a Redfin spokesperson.  They're looking in winter because they <em>need</em> to move, not because they're just looking for fun.  And if people are going to brave the cold to househunt during winter, then they're going to make their effort worthwhile.<br /> <br /> But before you pull a huge remodel to get it ready for the market, let's get one thing clear: Interior designers, realtors and home stagers almost unanimously agree that <a href= http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2014-04-10-Experts-Rate-Curb-Appeal-and-Staging-as-Best-Home-Improvement-Projects-for-Sellers  target= _hplink >you should NOT stage large-scale remodels of ANY kind before selling your house</a>. The investment, they say, simply isn't worth it. <br /> <br /> The key to successfully selling your home lies in mini renovations -- the ones you can do on tight budgets, in a couple of days, and (most of the time) without professional help.<br /> <br /> Feel free to breathe a sigh of relief and check out the suggestions for mini-improvements below. <br /> <br /> <strong>Mini-remodel #1: Front porch paint job</strong><br /> <em>Cost for gallon of paint:</em> <a href= http://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-Premium-Plus-Ultra-1-Gal-Pure-White-Satin-Interior-Paint-775001/100670972  target= _hplink >$33</a> <em>Time to complete:</em> <a href= http://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/how-to-paint-a-front-door/index.html  target= _hplink >Two days</a><br /> <img alt= 187248131  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385076/thumbs/o-187248131-570.jpg?1  /><br /> Repainting your front door is the most important revamp to execute, says Zillow interior design expert Kerrie Kelly. A fresh coat of color -- or a whole new door, if you're in need and willing to hire professional help -- will boost your home's  curb appeal,  letting visitors know they can expect good things before they even get inside. Complete the front porch look with new address plates, light fixtures, potted plants and a welcome mat.<br /> <br /> <strong>Mini-remodel #2: New kitchen and bathroom hardware</strong><br /> <em>Cost of new knobs:</em> <a href= http://www.homedepot.com/p/Liberty-1-3-8-in-Harmon-Cabinet-Hardware-Knob-10-Pack-P22669C-VBC-U1/203244640  target= _hplink >$25 for 10-pack</a> <em>Time to complete:</em> <a href= http://homeguides.sfgate.com/replace-old-cabinet-pulls-knobs-24203.html  target= _hplink >A few hours</a><br /> <img alt= 150973160  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385132/thumbs/o-150973160-570.jpg?1  /><br /> Kelly recommends picking up bulk packs of drawer knobs and door handles and replacing worn, rusted ones.  If you can streamline the hardware on your cabinetry, it's fantastic,  she says. Oh, and organize your shelves while you're at it.  People don't like to see clutter. <br /> <br /> <strong>Mini-remodel #3: Replace entryway light fixtures </strong><br /> <em>Cost of indoor wall lamp:</em> <a href= http://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-1-Light-Oil-Rubbed-Bronze-Sconce-GAY8411A/202022749?N=5yc1vZc7pi  target= _hplink >$17</a> <em>Time to complete:</em> <a href= http://www.diyadvice.com/diy/electrical/lights/porch-light/  target= _hplink >A day</a><br /> <img alt= 149628894  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385182/thumbs/o-149628894-570.jpg?3  /><br /> It's hard for designers to pinpoint exactly <em>why</em> perfect lighting puts house hunters in the mood to buy, but they agree that bright, warm lighting is key. First-impression areas like the entryway are especially important.<br /> <br /> <strong>Mini-remodel #4: Paint with neutrals</strong><br /> <em>Cost for gallon of paint:</em> <a href= http://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-Premium-Plus-Ultra-1-Gal-Pure-White-Satin-Interior-Paint-775001/100670972  target= _hplink >$33</a> <em>Time to complete:</em> <a href= http://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/how-to-paint-a-room/index.html  target= _hplink >Two days</a><br /> <img alt= 487916813  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385120/thumbs/o-487916813-570.jpg?1  /><br /> <a href= http://www.remodeling.hw.net  target= _hplink >Remodeling Magazine</a> editor Craig Webb has <a href= http://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2014/  target= _hplink >crunched the numbers</a> to find out which large-scale remodels make the most returns for homeowners, and he recommends one very simple trick:  If you talk to realtors, one of the first things they'll say is to repaint.  Add a coat of  light, bright and neutral  paint to any room (and all rooms, if you can!). Neutral tones allow shoppers to more easily imagine themselves in your space. They also have the least chance of turning them away. For example,  If red is a buyer's least-favorite color, they're going to be turned off by a freshly painted red room,  says Kelly.  With neutrals, they're more likely to identify. <br /> <br /> <strong>Mini-remodel #5: Refinish your countertops</strong><br /> <em>Cost of professional refinishing:</em> <a href= http://www.homewyse.com/services/cost_to_refinish_countertops.html  target= _hplink >from $322</a> <em>Time to complete:</em> <a href= http://www.miraclemethod.com/faq-countertop.htm#q4  target= _hplink >Two days</a><br /> <img alt= 153089195  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385094/thumbs/o-153089195-570.jpg?1  /><br /> When they see fresh countertops and fixtures, potential buyers rest at ease knowing they won't have to invest in renovations themselves, says Beth Maloney, a realtor who works with <a href= http://www.miraclemethod.com/  target= _hplink >Miracle Method</a>.   Surface refinishing really make a difference to the comfort level of a prospective buyer,  she says.  They see less worrisome dollar signs and more possibilities.

"Senate Republicans Object To Spending Bill Over Immigration"	"<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress cleared a $1.1 trillion spending bill for President Barack Obama's signature late Saturday night after a day of Senate intrigue capped by a failed, largely symbolic Republican challenge to the administration's new immigration policy.</p><br />               <p>The vote was 56-40 in favor of the measure, which funds nearly the entire government through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year. It also charts a new course for selected shaky pension plans covering more than 1 million retirees, including the possibility of benefit cuts.</p><br />               <p>The Senate passed the bill on a day Democrats launched a drive to confirm two dozen of Obama's stalled nominees to the federal bench and administration posts, before their majority expires at year's end.</p><br />               <p>Several Republicans blamed tea party-backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for giving the outgoing majority party an opportunity to seek approval for presidential appointees, including some that are long-stalled.</p><br />               <p>It was Cruz who pushed the Senate to cast its first vote on the administration's policy of suspending the threat of deportation for an estimated four million immigrants living in the country illegally. He lost his attempt Saturday night, 74-22, although Republican leaders have vowed to bring the issue back after the party takes control of the Senate in January.</p><br />               <p> If you believe President Obama's amnesty is unconstitutional, vote yes. If you believe President Obama's amnesty is consistent with the Constitution, vote no,  he said.</p><br />               <p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rebutted instantly, saying Cruz was  wrong, wrong, wrong on several counts,  and even Republicans who oppose Obama's policy abandoned the Texan.</p><br />               <p>The spending bill, which cleared the House on Thursday, was the main item left on Congress' year-end agenda, and exposed fissures within both political parties in both houses.</p><br />               <p>It faced opposition from Democratic liberals upset about the repeal of a banking regulation and Republican conservatives unhappy that it failed to challenge Obama's immigration moves.</p><br />               <p>While the legislation assures funding for nearly the entire government until next fall, it made an exception of the Department of Homeland Security. Money for the agency will run out on Feb. 27, when Republicans intend to try and force the president to roll back an immigration policy that removes the threat of deportation from millions of immigrants living in the United States illegally.</p><br />               <p>The legislation locks in spending levels negotiated in recent years between Republicans and Democrats, and includes a number of provisions that reflect the priorities of one party or the other, from the environment to abortion to the legalization of marijuana in the District of Columbia.</p><br />               <p>One, which drew vehement objections from the Democrats, would repeal a regulation imposed on banks in the wake of the near economic collapse of 2008. Critics called it a bailout for large financial institutions, but more than 70 House Democrats voted for it previously, and Obama made clear he didn't view it as a deal-killer.</p><br />               <p>The pension provision was a bipartisan agreement that opens the door for the first time to benefit cuts for current retirees covered by multi-employer funds in shaky financial condition.</p><br />               <p>Supporters said it would protect retirement income to the maximum extent possible without also endangering the solvency of the government fund that guarantees multi-employer plans. Critics said it posed a threat to the pension recipients, and that it could also become a precedent for other pensioners.</p><br />               <p>Immigration was at the heart of the day's events in the Senate.</p><br />               <p>Cruz seized on the issue late Friday night when he tried to challenge the bill. That led swiftly to the unraveling of an informal bipartisan agreement to give the Senate the weekend off, with a vote on final passage of the bill deferred until early this coming week.</p><br />               <p>That, in turn, led Reid, D-Nev., to call an all-day Senate session devoted almost exclusively to beginning time-consuming work on confirmation for 13 judicial appointees and 11 nominees to administration posts.</p><br />               <p>The list included Carolyn Colvin to head the Social Security Administration and Vivek Murthy as surgeon general.</p><br />               <p>As the day wore on, senators were forced to spend hour after hour on the Senate floor to cast their votes. One, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., sat at her desk quietly for awhile reading a book.</p><br />               <p>By evening, cocktail hour in the East, strains of Christmas carols could be heard from behind the closed doors of rooms that surround the chamber.</p><br />               <p>Republicans tried to slow the nomination proceedings, but several voiced unhappiness with Cruz, a potential presidential candidate in 2016.</p><br />               <p> I've seen this movie before, and I wouldn't pay money to see it again,  said Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., recalling Cruz' leading role a year ago in events precipitating a 16-day partial government shutdown that briefly sent GOP poll ratings plummeting.</p><br />               <p>Cruz, in turn, blamed Reid, saying his  last act as majority leader is to, once again, act as an enabler  for the president by blocking a vote on Obama's policy that envisions work visas for an estimated 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally.</p><br />               <p>Reid blamed a  small group of Senate Republicans  for the turn of events.</p><br />               <p>Asked if Cruz had created an opening for the Democrats, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah said,  I wish you hadn't pointed that out. </p><br />               <p>Hatch added,  You should have an end goal in sight if you're going to do these types of things and I don't see an end goal other than irritating a lot of people. </p><br />               <p>The GOP leader, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, made no public comment on the events, even though Cruz suggested Friday night McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, should not be entirely trusted to keep their pledge to challenge Obama's immigration policy.</p><br />               <p> We will learn soon enough if those statements are genuine and sincere,  Cruz said.</p><br />               <p>_____</p><br />               <p>Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report.</p> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 03:03:13 -0500"	"business"
"Fight Content Smog to Win Fame, Fortune and Your Dog's Undying Love"	"Scratch any millennial geek today and  disintermediation  will bubble to the surface immediately. <br /> <br /> For good reason. Our world is being redefined as never before. <br /> <br /> It's the new digital world order and here is quick review for brands in need of refreshment. <br /> <br /> 1) Expect your going to have competition from sources not on your radar screen. Be paranoid. Andy Grove was right.<br /> <br /> One of the most significant upsides of social media is its inherent ability to use platforms and apps to stay abreast of your direct competitors. <br /> <br /> 2) Either hire young or train and  savvy up  your existing staff. Whether we boomers like to admit it or not, these awesome young Turks are redefining our world. Get on board or get left in the digital dust. <br /> <br /> 3) Technical competency for businesses is no longer something you may need to think about. It's gonna run your business over if you don't get ahead of it. Spend money on tech, at least 20-30% of your marketing budget. Don't expect immediate payoffs; these will take time. <br /> <br /> 4) Risk and reward live together in this new world as never before. Yes, it's a high tide world but there are significant opportunities for smaller business who can live/work/run/breathe on their feet. #nimble<br /> <br /> 5) Be authentic. It's the new coin of the realm. No, I am not going to link out to some celebrity $1B valuation exec du jour.<br /> <br /> Authenticity Drivers<br /> <br /> <ul><li>Customer Reviews</li><br /> <li>Trust Signals on a Site (Copyright, BBB, Privacy, Contact with Phone, Chat Integration, Blog, Social Connectivity)</li><br /> <li>Transparency (not self promotional fluff)</li><br /> <li>Quality Images & Video</li><br /> <li>Social Engagement</li><br /> <li>Content Structure: Headlines, SEO  best practices  and  on page content </li><br /> <li>Forms with informative content (brevity)</li></ul><br /> <br /> Show some warts now and then and spend 20% of your time asking your customers how you are doing. They'll let you know if you've done something egregious. And, as below, attention spans are limited.  So, do your best and press on. <br /> <br /> 6) Know no sage (self included) has all the answers. Whether your outsourcing, working with a PR or digital agency (big or small) none of us has all the answers. Ideas are cheap, tactical execution drives opportunity. <br /> <br /> These are in the digital tea leaves you need to read: data, customer feedback, your staff, partners and maybe BOD members or investors. <br /> <br /> Collaboration is key to success as never before.<br /> <br /> 7) Today's always on noise means focus determines success or failure. Pick one or two social channels and build a meaningful presence that is demonstrated by engagement. <br /> <br /> Remember, you own your blog, web site and content. Your renting on social media platforms. They are all subject to change and focused on pleasing shareholders or investors, in spite of what most tell you. <br /> <br /> 8) Even if you have $30-50M in the bank or a line of credit, then buying eyeballs, followers, likes, etc. is still a dumb idea. Find customers, make em happy and forget about the $1B valuation based on bogus numbers. Fads come and go; customer driven brands do not.<br /> <br /> 9) Content gives your business digital oxygen. If your business can't create stellar content then you are wasting money on advertising. <br /> <br /> You must have an organic content strategy to succeed in today's digital world.<br /> <br /> 10) Understand news and information cycles are compressed more than ever. Hours and in some cases minutes, not days or weeks.  <br /> <br /> Your potential customers have the attention span of gnats (they are all distracted).<br /> <br /> When you got the shot take it. Hit em over the head with everything you got.<br /> <br /> You may not have the opportunity later.<br /> <br /> Static is not winning any Darwinian Digital Battles. #goforth<br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/how-to-redefine-your-mark_b_5698442.html  target= _hplink > How to Redefine Your Marketing Strategy in a Tech Drenched World   </a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/30-plus-apps-that-will-he_b_5704781.html  target= _hplink > 30 Plus Apps that Will Help You Grow Your Business and Leverage Technology  </a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/why-content-strategy-deli_b_5540319.html  target= _blank > How Content Heroes and Heroines are Made Not Born  </a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/andy-warhol-was-so-right-_b_5513838.html  target= _blank > What I Learned About Social Media from Andy Warhol </a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/andy-warhol-was-so-right-_b_5513838.html  target= _blank ></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/generate-more-revenue-low_b_5486752.html  target= _blank > How to Generate More Revenue and Lower Costs with the Cloud </a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/every-marketing-campaign-_b_5456060.html  target= _blank > Why Every Marketing Campaign Lives or Dies on this Foundation </a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/four-critical-marketing-s_b_5415322.html  target= _blank > Four Critical Marketing Strategies to Stand out in Today's Noisy World </a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/why-so-many-web-sites-are_b_5501728.html  target= _blank > Why so Many Web Sites are Lipstick on a Pig </a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/digital-has-kicked-tradit_b_5467145.html  target= _blank > How to Win Your Darwinian Digital Battles </a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lee-traupel-/why-your-content-lives-marketing_b_5463336.html  target= _blank > The Ten Second Race to Content Nirvana  </a> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 23:27:09 -0500"	"business"
"Black-White Wealth Gap Has Reached A 24-Year High"	"The economy is recovering, but not the bottom line for black Americans, according to new figures from the Pew Research Center.<br /> <br /> The median wealth of black households dropped an astonishing 34 percent from 2010 to 2013, according to Pew's <a href= http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/racial-wealth-gaps-great-recession/  target= _hplink >analysis of Federal Reserve data</a>. That of white households grew slightly over the same period.<br /> <br /> In dollars, that meant the median white household was worth $141,900, while the median black household was worth just $11,000. Wealth was defined here as the difference between the value of the household's assets -- like a house and stocks -- and its liabilities.<br /> <br /> <center><img alt= race wealth gap  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386896/thumbs/o-RACE-WEALTH-GAP-570.jpg?3  /></center><br /> <br /> Another way to look at it: The median wealth of white households was 13 times higher than the median wealth of black households last year. That’s the widest gap measured since 1989, when white people’s fortunes were 17 times bigger. Between then and now, the gap was at its narrowest in 1998 and 2001, when white households were six times as wealthy as black households.<br /> <br /> For many middle-class Americans, wealth is <a href= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-14/u-dot-s-dot-homeowners-are-repeating-their-mistakes  target= _hplink >tied to the value of their homes</a>. When the housing market crashed in 2007, the value of Americans' assets took a beating across racial groups. Yet in the recovery, blacks have not bounced back as well as whites. <br /> <br /> Black homeownership rates in the U.S. have historically been lower than white homeownership rates for a variety of reasons, but primarily due to a <a href= http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/  target= _hplink >long history of racist housing policies</a> that legal reforms have not entirely erased. During the housing boom of the last decade, blacks were more likely to get <a href= http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111318092881303093  target= _hplink >stuck with high-cost subprime mortgage loans</a> than whites. In the crash, blacks were <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/business/racial-wealth-gap-widened-during-recession.html?pagewanted=all  target= _hplink >more likely to lose their homes</a> than whites.<br /> <br /> The gap between white and Hispanic households, meanwhile, was at a 12-year high in 2013. According to Pew's report, white households' median net worth was about 10 times that of Hispanic households: $141,900 vs. $13,700. And Hispanics' median wealth had fallen 14 percent from 2010 to 2013.<br /> <br /> Over the same period, median income for black, Hispanic and other minority households plunged 9 percent. Median income for white households fell just 1 percent. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 21:02:56 -0500"	"business"

"Sandy Hook Anniversary Vigils Shine Light On A Nation Plagued By Gun Violence"	"This Sunday marks two years since 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, before turning his gun on himself. For the loved ones of gun violence victims across America, the anniversary of the tragedy serves as a grim reminder of how little has changed since then.<br /> <br /> On Thursday evening, dozens of family members grieving the loss of relatives who died in shootings, along with advocates for stricter gun laws, gathered at Roosevelt University in Chicago for a vigil memorializing both the Sandy Hook victims and victims of gun violence in their own city. The Cook County medical examiner’s office <a href= http://homicides.suntimes.com/2014/12/01/police-murders-increased-in-november-but-remain-down-for-2014/  target= _hplink >has reported 406 homicides</a>, many of them due to shootings, in Chicago this year.<br /> <br /> Speaking before the packed room, Beti Guevara, who teaches science classes at the Barreto Boys & Girls Club in the city’s Humboldt Park neighborhood, said she keeps five bullet casings she found on the sidewalk one day while walking around her community as a daily reminder of the importance of her work.<br /> <br /> <img alt= victims vigil chicago  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386764/thumbs/o-VICTIMS-VIGIL-CHICAGO-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><em>Participants in a Chicago vigil brought photographs of the loved ones they were remembering.</em></center><br /> <br /> When she asks students in her classes to raise their hands if they know somebody who has been shot, she said, on most days all the hands go up.<br /> <br /> “These are babies, but they’ve lost their fathers, their mothers, their sisters and their brothers,” Guevara told The Huffington Post. “When somebody gets killed through gun violence, there’s a ripple effect and that ripple effect is on the family -- but they don’t report on the news about it afterwards. After they bury the child, then where’s everybody?”<br /> <br /> Guevara can personally attest to this “ripple effect” -- her brother was gunned down when she was 12 years old, and she saw firsthand the effect his death had on her parents. She says she wishes that more protests, like the ones that have taken place in response to the grand jury decisions about Michael Brown's and Eric Garner’s deaths, would focus specifically on gun violence.<br /> <br /> “We’re going down the streets of Chicago with our rage and we’re blocking traffic,  Guevara said.  And yet we lost so many babies last week, and nobody is getting outraged and nobody’s stopping traffic.”<br /> <br /> Rafael Burgos came to the vigil to remember his 18-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who was shot and killed in October. She was picking up her brother from a friend's home, and  <a href= http://www.myfoxchicago.com/story/26825917/stray-bullet-enters-apartment-striking-and-killing-18-year-old-woman  target= _hplink >died instantly when bullets came through the window</a> of the house.<br /> <br /> Alexandra was “a good girl, never in any trouble never in any gangs of any kind,  Rafael told HuffPost.  She was a good, loving young lady. She was a very positive role model for many people.” The teenager was attending college and wanted to become a social worker some day.<br /> <br /> “It just feels like an emptiness,” Rafael said, describing life without his daughter. “Every day you wake up and it feels like there is a part of you missing, because there is. And it’s like you walk and you function and you want to participate in life and it’s like you feel like a shadow.”<br /> <br /> <img alt= rafael chicago vigil  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385376/thumbs/o-RAFAEL-CHICAGO-VIGIL-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><em>Less than two months ago, Rafael Burgos' daughter was fatally shot in Chicago. He said the shooting has made him  feel like a shadow  of his former self in his day-to-day life.</em></center><br /> <br /> Rafael added that the shooting also particularly impacted his younger son, who witnessed the tragedy.<br /> <br /> “My son struggles every day. He tries to go through the motions but he’s hurting, we’re all hurting,” Rafael said. “He’s trying to be strong for us.”<br /> <br /> Sharon Gardner, a mother of six, came to the vigil in honor of her brother, who she said served in the military in Operation Desert Storm. He was fatally shot in 1994, only six months after he returned to Chicago.<br /> <br /> “I just feel so cheated, so cheated,” Gardner told HuffPost. “He survived all that war and turmoil overseas -- then he wasn’t here with us more than six months in his hometown.”<br /> <br /> Gardner said she fears for her children, especially her 15-year-old son.<br /> <br /> “I pay life insurance [for him] before I pay my rent now,” she said.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sharon chicago vigil  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385368/thumbs/o-SHARON-CHICAGO-VIGIL-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><em>Sharon Gardner's brother was fatally shot 20 years ago. She says she still prays for him daily.</em></center><br /> <br /> Participants in the vigil walked two blocks to Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park and released 26 white balloons into the air in memory of the 26 people who died in the Sandy Hook shooting, along with an additional balloon that represented victims of gun violence in Chicago.<br /> <br /> At Washington, D.C.'s National Cathedral on Thursday, hundreds of mourners and activists took part in a two-hour vigil, including Gilles and Joyce Rousseau, whose daughter Lauren was a Sandy Hook teacher. The attendees used the service as an opportunity to recommit themselves to ending what speakers called  the nation's epidemic of gun violence.  Despite the vigil's hallowed location beneath the sweeping stone arches of the cathedral nave, the event felt less like a memorial service and more like a very polite rally aimed at calling supporters to action.<br /> <br /> In his remarks, the Right Rev. Gary R. Hall, dean of the National Cathedral, described an epic battle between  the gun lobby,  exemplified by the National Rifle Association, and what he called  the cross lobby,   the hundreds of congregations across the country taking  faithful action to prevent gun violence. <br /> <br />  The gun lobby is no match for the cross lobby,  Hall told the attendees.  In the end, we will prevail in this struggle because love and justice always finally win over fear and hate. Let us commit ourselves, today, to stand where God calls us to stand: with and for those who suffer and die from the illegal and immoral use of firearms. <br />  <br /> While the date of the event and the green memorial ribbons given to guests were both reminders of Sandy Hook, attendees drew resolve and spirit from more recent events as well, like the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin and the recent fatal police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Speakers and attendees alike said they viewed all the victims as pieces of the same problem: senseless deaths by guns. <br /> <br /> The sentiment was similar on Friday in the Riverdale area of the Bronx, where members and staff of the Sisters of Charity bowed their heads in remembrance not only of those killed at Sandy Hook, but of all victims of gun violence across the world.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sisters  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387816/thumbs/o-SISTERS-900.jpg?5  /><br /> <em>Members of the Sisters of Charity in the Bronx dedicate a moment of silence to victims of gun violence.</em><br /> <br /> “Hold all those lives hurt and lost through violence in your heart -- both those who have inflicted violence and those who have endured it,” said Sister Karen Gray. “Perhaps you know someone whose life was lost to gun violence. Gently hold their presence in your imagination. <br /> <br /> After a brief pause, the sisters read aloud the names of people in their community who had been lost to gun violence. Sister Barbara Ann Ford, a Bronx native who was shot to death in 2001 in Guatemala after spending two decades doing relief work in the country, was one name. Archbishop Oscar Romero was another. <br /> <br /> Gray read aloud statistics about background checks for buying guns in the United States. Forty-nine percent fewer suicides with a gun in states where a background check is required for all handgun sales. Thirty-eight percent fewer women killed with a gun by an intimate partner. Thirty-nine percent fewer police officers murdered with a handgun that was not their own. And so on. <br /> <br /> “God of life, every act of violence in our world, in our communities, between myself and others, destroys a part of your creation,” Gray said to close the service. “Stir in my heart a renewed sense of reverence for all life. Give me the vision to recognize your spirit in every human being, however they behave towards me. Make possible the impossible by cultivating in me the fertile seed of healing love. May I play my part in breaking the cycle of violence by realizing that peace begins with me.” <br /> <br /> At a church in the quiet suburb of Oak Park, Michigan, a group of 40 people assembled on Thursday to discuss the problem of gun violence in the nation and particularly in their state, whether in nearby Detroit or in a small town.<br /> <br /> Linda Brundage, the Michigan chapter leader of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, spoke at length about gun control and the need for stronger background check laws.<br /> <br /> “Stop being the silent majority,” she told attendees gathered at Our Mother of Perpetual Help Parish. “We must find our voices to change the gun culture in the United States.”<br /> <br /> The group held candles in a circle as they recited name after name, memorializing loved ones lost to gun violence.<br /> <br /> Cassandra Davis of Redford, Michigan, spoke to the crowd about her son Jeremiah, who was shot to death in November of last year by a 15-year-old. Jeremiah was 11.<br /> <br /> “I didn’t even allow my son to play with a gun,  Davis said.  He never owned own a toy gun. <br /> <br /> <img alt= cassandra davis  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387536/thumbs/o-CASSANDRA-DAVIS-900.jpg?6  /><br /> <center><em>Cassandra Davis lost her 11-year-old son, Jeremiah, to gun violence last year.</em></center><br /> <br /> According to news reports, the teen who shot Jeremiah was <a href= http://downriversundaytimes.com/2014/03/23/teen-sentenced-for-manslaughter/ >playing with a gun</a> that is believed to have been found at his grandmother’s house. The two boys were at Jeremiah’s father’s home in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn Heights, and Jeremiah’s father and the 15-year-old’s mother were both in the house when the shooting took place. The teen, whose name has not been released because he is a minor, later pleaded guilty to manslaughter.<br /> <br /> Davis said Thursday’s gathering was the first time she had been able to talk about her son at length in public. But she has become close with some of the women at Moms Demand Action and may continue to tell her story, in part to push for gun control laws to be strengthened and for gun safety to become a stronger priority, particularly in families with children.<br /> <br />  I protected my son as much as I could -- as a mom, as a parent,  she said.  He couldn’t ride his bike from one corner to the other [without me] standing there watching him. I didn’t let him go around the block. He’s like, ‘Mom, why can’t I go around the block and so-and-so did?’ Because I said so. I’m protecting you, it’s my job. I said, ‘Well, when you get to be 12 years old you can go around the block.’ He didn't make it.”<br /> <br /> Darrell and Katherine Lotharp brought their daughter, Starletta, to Thursday’s gathering. Starletta was eight months pregnant in the spring of 2002 when her partner, Michael Brown Sr., was shot and killed by a neighbor.<br /> <br /> “Unfortunately this neighbor was a convicted felon that had just got out of prison,” Darrell Lotharp said. “So what does he do? Get into an argument with a citizen, and he goes and pulls the gun out and shoots him. For nothing. They arrest him within 24 hours and he's right back in jail. It disrupted a whole family, over nothing, and that’s sad. There’s no rhyme or reason for it.”<br /> <br /> <img alt= lotharps  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387548/thumbs/o-LOTHARPS-900.jpg?4  /><br /> <em>Darrell and Katherine Lotharp with their daughter, Starletta, whose partner was shot to death when she was eight months pregnant.</em><br /> <br /> Starletta gave birth four days after the funeral.<br /> <br /> “He never saw his daughter. Things like that, that hurts,” her father continued. “If he didn’t have a weapon, I don’t think it would have happened. But he had easy access to a gun. What’s a felon doing with a gun?”<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Davis told attendees there are still countless things she can’t bring herself to do in her son’s absence: Go in his room. Watch University of Michigan football games. Eat pizza or macaroni and cheese. Walk at a favorite park. Watch the news.<br /> <br /> “I still can’t get over it. I wake up every morning saying I can’t believe my baby’s gone,” she said. “I kept my son in a good neighborhood, a good school district. It doesn’t matter where you’re at -- people have guns everywhere. <br /> <br /> <em>Christina Wilkie reported from Washington, D.C., Christopher Mathias reported from New York, Joseph Erbentraut reported from Chicago and Kate Abbey-Lambertz reported from Detroit.</em> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 00:05:14 -0500"	"politics"
"Pamela Wright's Son Was Shot Dead A Month After Newtown. This Is Her Story."	"WASHINGTON -- Tyrone Lawson's pictures are still on the wall of his home in Chicago. His clothes are there, too. Every now and then, his mother, Pamela Wright, will take out an old gray T-shirt to remind herself of his smell. She still sees his friends. And she even stays true to their dinner traditions: a pizza picnic every Wednesday. As time passes since that night her son was shot dead outside a college gymnasium, Pamela holds on more tightly to the routines they shared. <br /> <br />  I've moved on but I haven't moved much,  she says.  And I don't think I want to.  <br /> <br /> This Sunday marks the two-year anniversary of the shooting of 20 students and six educators at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. For much of the country, the grisly milestone will be marked with remembrances, moments of silence and calls for action. For Pamela Wright, it will mean that and more. She is part of the universe of individuals who have lost loved ones in <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/09/school-shootings-newtown_n_6292052.html  target= _hplink >the 94 school shootings</a> that have taken place since Newtown -- a number that <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/13/oregon-school-shooting-suspect-arrested_n_6319536.html  target= _hplink >went up to 95</a> during the time it took to publish this piece. <br /> <br />  You don’t think anything like that will happen to you,  Pamela says.  You don’t put yourself in that situation until it occurs. Now I look at Sandy Hook, those parents had to be insane. Literally, I mean, to even wake themselves up. <br /> <br /> Pamela is 54 years old. Tyrone was her only child. His birth was carefully planned. She hadn't wanted to get pregnant until she was 35, to give herself time to work and, perhaps, become more mature. From the moment Tyrone was born, though, he would remain unrelentingly wonderful to her. Every year, the two of them would take trips with their extended family to a camping site in nearby Indiana where they'd fish and swim and walk outdoors. They learned how to hook worms and would walk to the lakefront to find seashells, which they'd use to carve pieces of wood. Each year they'd mark a new piece with the date of their visit. <br /> <br /> When he entered his senior year of high school, Tyrone, an honors student, had lofty ambitions. He wanted to work at ComEd or maybe even become a Navy SEAL -- a career option that racked his mother's nerves. <br /> <br />  I didn’t want him to get killed in the war they were having,  Pamela explained.  I always tried to talk to him, like: ‘Are you really sure?’ I always had that fear. It didn’t matter. <br /> <br /> She pauses to reflect on how misplaced, in retrospect, those thoughts now seem. <br /> <br />  I never would have thought he would have gone to a basketball game and never came home to me,  she says.<br /> <br /> Pamela says she has no guilt about what happened <a href= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-18/news/chi-person-shot-outside-chicago-state-university-20130116_1_teen-shot-basketball-game-text-message  target= _hplink >the night of January 16, 2013</a>, though one gets the sense when talking to her that this is an ongoing internal battle she wages. What haunts her instead is that no internal triggers went off. No warning signs, no subconscious moment of dread. Instead, it was all quite normal. Tyrone, who was 17 at the time, texted her that afternoon, asking if he could go to the high school basketball game between Morgan Park and Simeon at Chicago State University that evening. She said no at first. It was a school night. But Pamela's own mother prevailed on her to let Tyrone enjoy the fleeting moments of his senior year. <br /> <br /> They met up at home before he left. After eating, Pamela drove him to the game and gave him money for the ticket. They said their goodbyes and she told him to be careful. <br /> <br />  I wonder if there was something that was telling me that I shouldn’t let him go and I just didn’t read it,  she says. <br /> <br /> What killed Tyrone, in the end, was misfortune. The basketball game had been contentious, though not remarkably so. But as the two teams shook hands after the game ended, an argument broke out. Players were separated and sent back to their lockers. The tension spilled out into the stands and, from there, into the parking lot. As Tyrone ran away from the scene, two men shot him twice in the back. Someone tried to get him to keep moving. But he couldn't get up. <br /> <br /> It was 9:20 p.m. Thirty-one minutes later, he was pronounced dead.  <br /> <br /> <iframe width= 570  height= 332  src= http://launch.newsinc.com/?type=VideoPlayer/Single&widgetId=2&trackingGroup=69016&siteSection=latimes_hom_non_sec&videoId=24241331  frameborder= no  scrolling= no  noresize marginwidth= 0  marginheight= 0 ></iframe><br /> <br /> What does it feel like to be told that your child has died? <br /> <br /> Pamela still isn't sure. In that moment after she received calls from a relative and from Tyrone's friends, she felt like a vast cone was being placed over her life. She could see the chaos surrounding her. But inside, she couldn't yet feel, hear or comprehend it. <br /> <br />  You don’t have a mind,  she says.  There is nothing going through you. … It is indescribable. Sometimes I wish I could describe how your whole life has been eliminated. If you look at your children, they are like 99 percent of your life. And for someone to just kill your child is ... it’s ... unbelievable. It really is. <br /> <br /> Pamela refused to look at Tyrone's body at the hospital, thinking that it would, quite literally, kill her. Gregory Young, her then-fiance and now her husband, identified the body instead. It was only later, at the coroner's office, that Pamela got her first glimpse.<br /> <br /> The shooting made headlines, in large part because Simeon was (and remains) a basketball powerhouse, featuring the nation's top high school player at the time, Jabari Parker. But even just one month after Sandy Hook, the public -- and certainly the city of Chicago -- was already growing desensitized to such violence. When Tyrone was shot, there had already been four school shootings since Newtown, two of which had resulted in deaths.<br />  <br /> Early on, Pamela coped by pretending her son wasn't dead. She'd tell people that he had gone away to the Navy and would be back soon.  That was my way of dealing with what had happened,  she says.  He was going to come back and I’ll see him then. <br /> <br /> Had she had another child, Pamela figures, it might have been easier. She'd never replace Tyrone, but she'd shift her focus elsewhere. Instead, she filled the void by reaching out beyond her family. She went into therapy, started keeping a journal and talked to other mothers who had lost children to gun violence. <br /> <br />  It's not hard to find them in Chicago,  Pamela notes.<br /> <br /> More recently, she's dipped her toes into the world of activism. Last week, she and Young boarded a plane and flew to Washington, D.C., for a press conference marking the two-year anniversary of Newtown. Standing in front of a crowd of 30 or so in Senate Room 115 inside the Capitol Building, Pamela nervously chewed gum and listened to the procession of speakers. As Everytown for Gun Safety, the group hosting the event, played <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKmvrOZxhWo  target= _hplink >a new video</a> of a school shooting drill, she turned away and wiped tears from her eyes. <br /> <br /> When it came time for her to speak, Pamela took a deep breath, pushed her hair out of her face, and approached the microphone. <br /> <br />  Some media outlets don't count what happened to my son as a school shooting,  she told the crowd, referencing the disputes over the methodology Everytown uses to count post-Sandy Hook shootings.  They whittle down their lists by removing anything resembling so-called gang violence, not to mention accidental shootings or suicide. But Americans know that any time a gun is fired on school grounds, fear strikes an entire community. <br /> <br /> <img alt= pamela wright  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388758/thumbs/r-PAMELA-WRIGHT-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> After the speech was done, Pamela was relieved. She sat back in a chair and looked around the room. <br /> <br /> In less than two years, life has brought Pamela horrible and inconceivable twists and turns -- but not closure, at least not yet. The <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/tyrone-lawson-shooting-te_n_2497110.html  target= _hplink >men who killed Tyrone</a> are both in jail. Pamela is still left wondering about the moment they killed her son. <br /> <br />  The only thing I would like to know is, did my baby die fast, did he know I loved him, and did he feel pain?  she says.  I can’t answer those. I know he loved me, but did he have a chance to think about that I loved him? <br /> <br /> <strong>Watch an interview Pamela Wright gave to the Chicago Tribune shortly after her son Tyrone was killed:</strong><br /> <br /> <iframe src='http://widget.newsinc.com/single.html?WID=2&VID=24243636&freewheel=69016&sitesection=sechicagotribune&w=570&h=400' height='400' width='570' scrolling='no' frameborder='0' marginwidth='0' marginheight='0'></iframe> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 00:05:14 -0500"	"politics"
"Senate Passes Government Funding Bill"	"WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed the $1.1 trillion government funding bill Saturday night that will keep Uncle Sam in business through next September, while handing lucrative Christmas presents to Wall Street and political parties.<br /> <br /> The bill, which funds most of the government for the rest of the fiscal year, had been tied up in procedural disagreements. But all senators eventually relented, paving the way for passage of the bill on a 56 to 40 vote.<br /> <br /> The Senate entered a rare weekend session after Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) refused to consent to an agreement Friday that would have given their colleagues the weekend off. <br /> <br /> Forced to be in session, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) used the opportunity to push ahead with a slew of President Barack Obama’s nominations, which Reid wants to pass before the Senate ends the session for the year.<br /> <br /> Lee and Cruz blocked Reid’s plan Friday night, angering members of both parties who <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/us/spending-bill-senate.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >didn’t understand what the pair hoped to gain</a>.  Evidently, the two conservative allies were talked into letting votes proceed on the so-called  cromnibus  spending bill, rather than stalling until Monday morning.<br /> <br /> But Cruz insisted on raising a point of order against the bill's constitutionality, thereby forcing the Senate to hold an extra vote before moving onto to final passage. He was targeting the funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which is carrying out Obama's recent orders on immigration to spare up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.<br /> <br />  If you believe President Obama's amnesty is unconstitutional, vote yes,  Cruz said in an appeal to his colleagues.  If you believe Obama's amnesty is consistent with the Constitution, then vote no. <br /> <br /> Had a majority of senators agreed with the conservative firebrand, the bill would have been sent back to the House and set up another showdown over longterm funding to the government. The Senate voted overwhelmingly, however, to table the motion, 22 to 74. A large number of Republicans, including Sens. Dan Coats (Ind.), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Ron Johnson (Wis.), Pat Toomey (Pa.), and Roger Wicker (Miss.), sided against Cruz. <br /> <br /> Following the vote, Democrats crowed that Cruz's procedural objections unwittingly set up the confirmation of 24 Obama nominees, some of whom might have otherwise stalled in the final days of the session. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who publicly opposed Cruz's strategy, agreed.<br /> <br />  I haven't seen Harry Reid smile like this in years, I don't like it one bit,  he <a href= https://twitter.com/GrahamBlog/status/543963600944386049  target= _hplink >tweeted</a>.<br /> <br />  Sen. Cruz's stunt got two fewer votes than the 24 Obama nominees he helped Senate Democrats advance tonight,  said Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson.<br /> <br /> Cruz and Lee insisted on the vote because they argued that it would put senators on record either backing or opposing Obama’s efforts. <br /> <br /> The spending bill provides funding through the end of the fiscal year for all government operations except the Department of Homeland Security, which only gets money to last through February. Republicans insisted on that shorter time frame because they intend to use the deadline to try to defund Obama’s immigration action. But Cruz <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/13/ted-cruz-spending-bill_n_6320228.html  target= _hplink >suggested Friday night</a> that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) might not actually follow through. <br /> <br /> One controversial provision in the spending bill weakens the Dodd-Frank Act's restrictions on banks that want to trade in the same sorts of risky derivatives that sparked the financial meltdown of 2008, and allows the banks to back their bets with taxpayer-backed insurance. The bill also dramatically increases the amounts that wealthy donors can give to the major political parties. Some Democrats have said that the two measures together amount to letting wealthy Wall Street employees earn more money, which they can then use to reward lawmakers who backed the spending deal.<br /> <br /> A number of prominent liberals voted against the bill because of those provisions, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). In all, 21 Democrats and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) voted against the measure, as did 18 Republicans.<br /> <br /> Obama is expected to sign the bill quickly. Under a stopgap measure Congress passed earlier, the government is funded until Wednesday.<br /> <br /> <em>This story was updated to reflect final passage.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.

The peaceful demonstration began near City Hall at a corner unofficially named for Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old unarmed man who was fatally shot in the back in 2009 by a transit officer who later claimed he mistook his gun for a Taser. <br /> <br /> On the crowded steps of the county courthouse, Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson, addressed the mass of demonstrators. Grant's name is often invoked at the nearly nightly protests that have taken place in Oakland and nearby Berkeley since Nov. 24, when a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, did not indict officer Darren Wilson for shooting unarmed teenager Michael Brown. <br /> <br />  We want officers held accountable. We want officers to be able to feel the pain just as we feel it,  Johnson said.  We got to stand up to the police brutality in our nation. <br /> <br /> <img alt= oakland  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2389214/thumbs/o-OAKLAND-900.jpg?1  /><br /> <br /> The mother of 15-year-old Derrick Gaines, who was killed by a South San Francisco police officer in 2012, also spoke to the crowd from the courthouse steps.<br /> <br />  Where are the teenagers? Where are the young people? We are here for you,  said Rachel Guido Red to cheers.  This is a wonder, wonderful protest for a horrible, horrible cause. <br /> <br /> Vichea Harvey, who lives in nearby Richmond, brought her 15-year-old nephew, Estoban Torres, and spoke to HuffPost about fearing what might happen if he gets accosted by police.<br /> <br />  I have African-American children, nephews and nieces, and they have been harassed by police,  said Vichea Harvey, 48, a caterer and Laney College student.  I won't let him outside except to go to school,  she said about Torres.<br /> <br /> Previous Bay Area protests have <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/07/protest-of-chokehold-deat_0_n_6282904.html  target= _hplink >occasionally turned violent</a>, and hundreds have been arrested. That worried Harvey, but not enough to discourage her from attending her first demonstration.<br /> <br />  If we all be afraid, nothing will get accomplished,  Harvey said. <br /> <br /> <img alt= oakland  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2389216/thumbs/o-OAKLAND-900.jpg?1  /><br /> <br /> Many black people in the crowd spoke about being singled out by police. <br /> <br />  I get harassed by cops. They stare at me. I get followed. I don't feel like a citizen,  said Tristan Johnson, 22, an Oakland resident who attends the University of British Columbia. He said Saturday's demonstration made him optimistic.  This is the beginning of a movement,  he added.  Today is not the end-all. <br /> <br /> Norm Berzon, 71, a resident of nearby Emeryville, said he's been politically active since he belonged to the Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960s.  The shit that's going on is worthy of protest,  he told HuffPost.  There are good cops and there are bad cops. But they all have a license to kill, and the bad cops are using it. <br /> <br /> After the official event broke up around 4:30, a large crowd of protesters moved back to the starting point at 14th Street and Broadway, where they disrupted traffic.<br /> <br /> In Los Angeles, on the corner of Hollywood and Highland, 50 protesters circled four intersections, disrupting traffic and chanting  no justice no peace, no racist police.  <br /> <br /> It has been a bigger group than appeared last week, according to 28-year-old Sharlene, a recent transplant from New York. <br /> <br />  Everyone has a stake in this -- everyone should be out here,  she told The Huffington Post. She talked about her brother,  the best kid you could imagine,  who has been stopped and frisked seven times by local police.<br /> <br /> Nearby, <a href= http://www.ktvu.com/story/27622188/protesters-travel-from-berkeley-to-oakland-for-millions-march  target= _hplink >hundreds marched from Berkeley to Oakland</a> while more than a thousand rallied outside the Oakland courthouse.

I appreciate the diversity and I appreciate that [the white allies] are taking cues from us and not taking over.   <br /> <br /> Consensus among several protesters in Los Angeles was that awareness of racial injustice and accountability of police brutality were the salient needs. <br /> <br /> That sentiment was shared among the tens of thousands of others who expressed the same concerns throughout the country -- and as portrayed in images from protests across America.

"This is Exactly What Pay-2-Play Looks Like"	"Our new film <em><a href= http://pay2play.tv  target= _hplink >PAY 2 PLAY</a></em> is centered on how our political process is bound invariably by big money interests who use campaign spending as bait for politicians to get massive payouts in return from the public piggy bank.  As Noam Chomsky explains at the beginning,  Both parties are two factions of one party--the Business Party.  I've learned that Chomsky's mere inclusion makes the film seem too  liberal  for some, coupled with the refrain:  Why can't you show <em>both </em>sides? If you showed <em>both</em> sides, then it might be more persuasive to (party label here).  <br /> <br /> Choosing sides in an election is secondary to achieving a real democracy in the first place, so that everyone's voices are included.  Today, half the country doesn't vote, and half of Congress are millionaires.  The inclusive component of what makes America special has been under siege for decades, by people who already have lots of money, and seek to use our government to make themselves even richer.  To show  both sides  in this context is to have a billionaire explain that even as the middle class suffers, he intends to use the Republican Congress which he spent a fortune to help elect cut the hell out of spending, balance the budget, reduce regulations, and support business.  This actually does appear in our film, when Lee Fang interviewed David Koch celebrating the first day of the Republican Congress in 2011. Koch had just spent money helping elect 1,053 candidates out of 1,216 winning candidates in 2010.  <br /> <br /> The other gasp of concern comes from passionate activists on the left, who ask,  The two parties are the same? How can you say that? One party denies climate change, supports torture, the other supports women rights and equality...  and you know the rest. In <em>PAY 2 PLAY</em>, we see populist candidates undermined by their own party leaders. We see vanity candidates who are self-financed that don't really believe in anything except that they should be in office, and lying is a good way to get there. We see the effects of low voter turnout. There are so many other obstacles in the road to an open democracy.<br /> <br /> The reason we use the number two in our title <em>PAY 2 PLAY</em> is not an homage to Prince lyrics, it is because we have a two-party system, and you have to pay either (or both) political parties if you want to participate.  There might be two different buses that want to go in two different directions, but they both run on the same fuel: campaign cash.  Endless amounts of it.  And this week the U.S. Congress approved a spending package with so many kickbacks and give-aways, in the words of the Great Curtis Scagnetti, it's more rigged than an S&M pirate ship. This is what this  CRomnibus  is, an S&M pirate ship.  <br /> <br /> Calling it craven doesn't begin to do it justice.  More like a re-imagined Disney show,  That's So Craven,  this spending bill is a stunning piece of pay-2-play™ at the hands of both parties, despite Elizabeth Warren and Nancy Pelosi making <a href= http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-12/the-great-swaps-rebellion-of-2014-and-elizabeth-warrens-postobama-democratic-party  target= _hplink >powerful stands against it</a>.   While we posit in our film that Insiders versus Outsiders are the  both sides  we should be addressing, who could better make that case now than the Insiders themselves, the incumbents?  Somehow, in the hundreds of pages necessary to fund the government, someone tripped and fell and dropped<a href= http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/12/Campaign-Finance-Rider-Hidde-Inside-Congress-New-Spending-Bill/383629/  target= _hplink > this bit of legislation in</a>: party contribution limits were suddenly raised ten-fold.  How messed up do you have to make campaign finance laws that even <a href= http://www.citizensunited.org/press-releases.aspx?article=8592  target= _hplink >Citizens United</a> denounces it as a gratuitous incumbent incentive?  Our elected representatives agreed with no debate that the government couldn't function without jacking up contribution limits for how much their parties can receive.  That shit is <em><a href= http://electionlawblog.org/?p=69099  target= _hplink >deep</a></em>.  <br /> <br /> Even deeper shit is the paragraphs that were written in this spending bill not by some elected leader or their staff, but by <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/business/furor-over-move-to-aid-big-banks-in-funding-bill.html?ref=politics&_r=0  target= _hplink >Citigroup</a>, to rollback financial regulation without hearing or deliberation. That backdoor action is literally pay-2-play at its purest: those millions that Citigroup has put into lobbying and contributions could reap them billions.  Jack Abramoff makes this clear in our doc:  The return on investment is astonishing.   Putting money into politics is a bigger return on investment than Wall Street.  That's why Wall Street is writing our legislation.  <br /> <br /> Combined with bonus features like <a href= https://filemanager.capwiz.com/filemanager/file-mgr/ibt/1_Omnibus_Letter_to_Congress_12_10_14.pdf  target= _hplink >attacking unions</a> and <a href= http://m.thenation.com/blog/192657-were-facing-ominous-omnibus-assault-democracy  target= _hplink >overruling a local election</a>, this trillion dollars spent by leaders from <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-wellington-ennis/activist-comics-end-gerry_b_6188354.html?utm_hp_ref=comedy&ir=Comedy  target= _hplink >heavily-gerrymandered districts</a> makes this Cromnibus a Pay-2-Play Parade.<br /> <br /> Our film unfolds around a reimagined monopoly board, likening the richest-takes-all board game to the contest of winning elections  The thesis of the film is stated ten minutes in:  If we could learn the rules of the game, maybe we could find a way outsiders could win.   Taking back our democracy starts with taking back our elections.  That's achieved through People Power.  As John Nichols explains,  If you want to challenge the money power, you are going to have to build People Power. For every million dollars they spend, you're going to have to get a thousand people. It's not easy. But it is necessary.   We can circumvent the impacts of big money in our election process, but it takes people getting involved at every level, like a chain of hands running through your community. <br /> <br /> Politicians love to get in front of a parade that is already underway.  Let's make that parade.  Let's make the fight to #GetMoneyOut <em>cool</em>.

"Dear Senator Cruz: Stop Scapegoating Immigrant Families"	"Last night during the Senate debate on funding the government, I listened to my colleagues' remarks, some of which ranged far afield from the budget itself. <br /> <br /> That was fine. But what was not fine -- what was objectionable, what was truly upsetting -- were the remarks from Senator Cruz blaming undocumented immigrants in this country for our economic woes. <br /> <br /> He said,  This executive amnesty is profoundly unfair to the 92 million Americans who are not working right now... especially to the African-American community which is facing historic unemployment. <br /> <br /> History has shown it is not just wrong, but dangerous to turn one group against another and scapegoat an entire community of people to score political points.  <br /> <br /> Senator Cruz railed against President Obama's executive action on immigration, calling it  illegal and unconstitutional amnesty.  <br /> <br /> But that description couldn't be more incorrect.  There will not be amnesty for undocumented immigrants under the President's recent action. <br /> <br /> This is about giving a temporary reprieve from the threat of deportation for hardworking immigrants and those brought to this country as children. This is about keeping families together -- about real family values.   <br /> <br /> Every single President since 1952 has used his authority to make choices about how to most effectively execute and enforce our nation's immigration laws.  <br /> <br /> President Ronald Reagan and President George H.W. Bush both issued similar executive orders to keep families together. <br /> <br /> And now, President Obama has likewise revised our immigration priorities to prevent families from being torn apart.<br /> <br /> What President Obama has done is say, if you are a parent of a child who is a lawful U.S. resident you can stay in America if you register, pass a criminal background check, and pay your fair share of taxes.<br /> <br /> And he says to these DREAMers who came here when they were kids: you too can come out of the shadows and no longer endure the daily fear of possible deportation. <br /> <br /> These are young people who grew up in every way as  American  -- all that separates them from their classmates is a piece of paper. These are young people who are working hard to achieve the American dream.<br /> <br /> These are young people like:<br /> <br /> • Marcela Zhou, who moved from Mexico to the U.S. at the age of 12.  After graduating as her high school's valedictorian, Marcela enrolled in UC San Diego, where she graduated with a degree in Human Biology.<br /> <br /> • Luis Liang, who came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, excelled in school, and awarded a full-ride scholarship to U.C. Berkeley, where he graduated from the Haas School of Business.<br /> <br /> • Itzel Guillen, who was born in Mexico City and came to the United States with her family nearly 14 years ago.  She is currently a political science major at San Diego State University working and volunteering in her community.<br /> <br /> So for Senator Cruz to stand in the beautiful Senate chamber and ask his colleagues to scapegoat and punish these DREAMers and the parents of U.S. citizens is a very bad day indeed. It's a dark day. <br /> <br /> If Senator Cruz and his allies want to deport twelve million undocumented immigrants then they should say so. If they want to split up families, they should say so. Let's have that debate.  <br /> <br /> Because this is a nation of immigrants. It is who we are--who we always have been. We are a country that should respect the hardworking American children who want their parents to stay, a country that should respect the DREAMers who have proven their mettle and their worth to our country. <br /> <br /> We are a country that should support the President's executive action as the temporary measure it is, and then come together to pass comprehensive immigration reform once and for all.

"Senate Passes Short-Term Funding Measure To Avoid Government Shutdown"	"WASHINGTON (AP) — Their power ebbing, Senate Democrats launched a last-minute drive Saturday to confirm roughly 20 of President Barack Obama's nominees, and several Republicans blamed tea party-backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for creating an opening for the outgoing majority party to exploit.<br /> <br /> Lawmakers took a break in their intrigue long enough to send Obama legislation that provides funds for the government to remain open until Wednesday at midnight, easing concerns of a shutdown. A separate, $1.1 trillion long-term funding bill remained in limbo.<br /> <br /> Republicans tried to slow the nomination proceedings, but several voiced unhappiness with Cruz, a potential presidential candidate in 2016. One likened his actions to his role in precipitating a 16-day partial government shutdown more than a year ago.<br /> <br />  I've seen this movie before, and I wouldn't pay money to see it again,  Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said between seemingly endless roll calls.<br /> <br /> Cruz blamed the Democrats' leader, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, saying his  last act as majority leader is to, once again, act as an enabler  for the president by blocking a vote on Obama's policy that envisions work visas for an estimated 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally.<br /> <br /> Cruz said Reid was  going to an embarrassing length to tie up the floor to obstruct debate and a vote on this issue because he knows amnesty is unpopular with the American people, and he doesn't want the Democrats on the record as supporting it. <br /> <br /> Democrats lost control of the Senate in the November, and Republicans will take over when the new Congress convenes in January.<br /> <br /> <br /> Lawmakers in both parties said the $1.1 trillion spending measure eventually would pass. It faced opposition from Democratic liberals upset about the repeal of a banking regulation and Republican conservatives unhappy that it failed to challenge Obama's immigration moves.<br /> <br /> Immigration was the issue that Cruz cited late Friday night when he tried to challenge the bill. That led swiftly to the unraveling of an informal bipartisan agreement to give the Senate the weekend off, with a vote on final passage of the bill deferred until early this coming week.<br /> <br /> That, in turn led Reid to call an all-day Senate session to be devoted almost exclusively to beginning time-consuming work on confirmation for as many as nine judicial appointees and an unknown number of nominees to administration posts.<br /> <br /> Reid blamed a  small group of Senate Republicans  for the turn of events.<br /> <br /> The list of nominees included Carolyn Colvin to head the Social Security Administration, Vivek Murthy to become surgeon general, Sarah Saldana as head of Customs and Immigration Enforcement and Antony Blinken to the No. 2 position at the State Department.<br /> <br /> Democrats did not provide a complete list, saying it might change. More than a dozen judicial nominations remained on the Senate's calendar, and dozens of appointees to administration positions.<br /> <br /> Several Republicans fumed that Cruz had erred.<br /> <br /> Asked if Cruz had created an opening for the Democrats, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah said,  I wish you hadn't pointed that out. <br /> <br /> Hatch added,  You should have an end goal in sight if you're going to do these types of things and I don't see an end goal other than irritating a lot of people. <br /> <br /> Added Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.:  I fail to see what conservative ends were achieved.  He also said he was worried about what the events means for next year, when Republicans are in charge.<br /> <br />  The other concern I have here now is the nominations that are going to get through that otherwise wouldn't,  said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D.<br /> <br /> Appearing irritated, some Republicans spoke with Cruz on the Senate floor about his actions. At another point, Cruz huddled in the rear of the chamber with Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who had supported him on Friday evening, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, another tea party-backed lawmaker.<br /> <br /> The GOP leader, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, made no public comment on the events, even though Cruz suggested Friday night McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, should not be entirely trusted to keep their pledge to challenge Obama's immigration policy when Republicans gain two-house control of Congress in January.<br /> <br />  We will learn soon enough if those statements are genuine and sincere,  Cruz said.<br /> <br /> The $1.1 trillion spending bill provides funds for nearly the entire government through the Sept. 30 end of the current budget year.<br /> <br /> The sole exception is the Department of Homeland Security, which is funded only until Feb. 27. Republicans intend to try then to force the president to roll back his immigration policy that removes the threat of deportation from millions of immigrants living in the United States illegally.<br /> <br /> The events quickly overshadowed developments in the House earlier in the week, when Democratic divisions were on display over the spending bill.<br /> <br /> House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California opposed the bill, and publicly chastised Obama for giving it his support.<br /> <br /> ____<br /> <br /> Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this story. By a voice vote, senators approved the latest short-term funding bill as lawmakers continue to wrangle over a $1.1 trillion spending package and Obama's nominations.<br /> <br /> That package would cover much of the government through most of 2015."

"Tens Of Thousands March On NYPD Headquarters To Protest Police Killings"	"Tens of thousands of protesters streamed out of New York City's Washington Square Park on Saturday to protest <a href= http://gawker.com/unarmed-people-of-color-killed-by-police-1999-2014-1666672349  target= _hplink >the killings of unarmed black people by police officers</a>, as part of the  <a href= http://www.millionsmarchnyc.org/  target= _hplink >Millions March NYC.</a> <br /> <br /> The crowd began to wind its way through Manhattan. A large labor union contingent was present, including members of the Communications Workers of America wearing red shirts and AFL-CIO supporters waving blue signs.<br /> <br /> In contrast to other marches over the past week, this large, orderly demonstration took place during the day. A number of families with children took part, and demonstrators followed a pre-planned route. The march made its way uptown to Herald Square, then looped back downtown, with thunderous chants of  Hands up! Don't shoot!  and  Justice! Now!  echoing down Broadway. The demonstration culminated at One Police Plaza, the Lower Manhattan location of the New York City Police Department's headquarters.<br /> <br /> Organizers estimated that 30,000 demonstrators participated in the march. The NYPD told The Huffington Post that, as of the official end of the march, no arrests had been made.<br /> <br /> Protesters held up 8 panels depicting Eric Garner's eyes, created by <a href= http://www.jr-art.net/  target= _hplink >an artist known as JR</a>.  The eyes were chosen as the most important part of the face,  said Tony Herbas of Bushwick, an assistant to the artist.<br /> <br /> <img alt= garner eyes  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388892/thumbs/o-GARNER-EYES-900.jpg?5  /><br /> <br /> Ron Davis, whose <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/01/michael-dunn-guilty_n_5913926.html  target= _hplink >son Jordan was shot dead</a> by a man in Florida after an argument over loud music, was at the head of the march. <br /> <br />  We have to make everybody accountable,  Davis told HuffPost.  You can’t continue to see videos of chokeholds, videos of kids getting shot in the back, and say it’s all right. We have to make sure we have an independent investigator investigate these crimes that police carry out. <br /> <br /> Michael Dunn, the man who killed Jordan, was <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/17/michael-dunn-sentenced_n_6003868.html  target= _hplink >convicted of first-degree murder</a> and sentenced to life without parole in October. Davis said Saturday that Dunn's conviction proves it's possible that justice can be served in racially charged cases. <br /> <br />  We ended up getting a historic movement in Jacksonville,  Davis said.  We had an almost all-white jury, with seven white men, convict a white man for shooting down an unarmed boy of color. <br /> <br /> <img alt= black lives matter  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388940/thumbs/o-BLACK-LIVES-MATTER-900.jpg?2  /><br /> <br /> Also at the front of the march were New York City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez and New York state Assemblyman-elect Charles Barron.<br /> <br /> Matthew Brown, a 19-year-old who is African-American and Hispanic, marched down Broadway with his mother, aunt and other family members.<br /> <br />  I'm trying to support a movement that really needs young people like myself,  said Brown.  I'm here to speak for Mike Brown. <br /> <br /> The teenager said part of his motivation for making the trek from West Orange, New Jersey, with his family was his own personal experience. He's encountered racist verbal abuse from police in Jersey City, he said, who have called him  spic  and monkey. <br /> <br /> Citing the cases of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, Brown said part of the reason he wanted to speak out was because of the way police represent encounters with African-Americans.  I just see so many lies after lies. <br /> <br /> He also attended the People's Climate March in September. But this march felt more intense to him.  This is one that's really affecting people on a deep, emotional level,  Brown said.<br /> <br /> Krystal Martinez, a 23-year-old schoolteacher, said she attended the march to send a simple message:  I don't want my students' names chanted at any of these events. <br /> <br /> <img alt= krystal martinez  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2389010/thumbs/o-KRYSTAL-MARTINEZ-900.jpg?2  /><br /> <br /> Because she teaches at a charter school that serves students from Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights, Martinez said, she was painfully aware of the challenges black youth face in interactions with police.<br /> <br /> Martinez, a Harlem resident, pointed to a sign held by a colleague with a quote from a 13-year-old girl who had been stopped by police:  The first time I was stopped and frisked I was so scared I didn't leave my house for a week. <br /> <br />  Eighty-five percent of my students are black and this is their lives,  Martinez said, emphasizing that she spoke for herself and not her school.  I'm out here because of my kids. <br /> <br /> Some protesters arrived with concrete policy proposals. Marcia Dupree, a homecare supervisor, came bearing a sign that read,  We must change the law ... no grand jury!!! <br /> <br />  The root of the problem,  Dupree said, was the closeness between grand juries and police. In the wake of two grand juries' decisions not to indict officers in the Michael Brown and Eric Garner deaths, the idea of abolishing the institution has gotten a lot of attention from both <a href= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/12/abolish_grand_juries_justice_for_eric_garner_and_michael_brown.html  target= _hplink >the media</a> and policymakers, <a href= http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/alex-stuckey/missouri-black-caucus-chairman-files-constitutional-amendment-to-abolish-grand/article_c2296a2b-665c-5e79-8123-2da78d2d572a.html  target= _hplink >including the chairman of Missouri's Legislative Black Caucus</a>.<br /> <br /> Dupree added that she'd never really considered herself much of an activist before. Serving on the board of her local library in Mount Vernon, New York, was  as political as I got.  But she said she has been moved to protest out of concern for her 13-year-old daughter -- who was marching in crutches by her side -- and her 21-year-old son.<br /> <br />  I feel like I need to stand up,  said Dupree.  It could be my son. <br /> <br /> <img alt= marcia dupree  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2389080/thumbs/o-MARCIA-DUPREE-900.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> At times, the march blurred surreally with Santacon -- the sloshy daytime celebration of Christmas (and drinking) that New Yorkers hate on every year.<br /> <br /> A number of Santacon participants joined the march. Others were less enthusiastic.  I love cops, seriously,  one man in a Santa cap told an impassive officer.  I hate these people.  Then he walked off with his fellow revelers.<br /> <br /> <img alt= santa  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388988/thumbs/o-SANTA-900.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> Saturday's day of action came in response to two separate grand jury decisions not to indict police officers for killing unarmed black men. On Nov. 24, a St. Louis County grand jury voted <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/24/michael-brown-grand-jury_n_6159070.html  target= _hplink >not to indict Police Officer Darren Wilson</a>, who fatally shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Less than two weeks later, a Staten Island grand jury <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/03/eric-garner_n_6263656.html  target= _hplink >declined to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo</a>, who killed Eric Garner by putting him in a chokehold.<br /> <br /> Brown's death on Aug. 9 triggered <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/25/ferguson-timeline_n_6220166.html  target= _hplink >months of protests</a> in Ferguson against police killings -- protests that have since spread nationwide. <br /> <br /> One group of marchers turned into a street protest choir, singing,  We're not gonna stop, until people are free. <br /> <br /> <center><iframe width= 560  height= 315  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/zG0yb7uURrA  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe><br /> </center><br /> Beneva Davies, a 23-year-old Harlem resident who lent her voice to the group, said the most singing she usually does is in the shower.<br /> <br />  It's not really about your voice,  Davies said.  It's about your <em>voice</em>, right? <br /> <br /> <center><iframe width= 560  height= 315  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/WvGRBK6sA_A?list=UUZ1XQ0xQmg0Pz9l3aMQZVcw  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe><br /> </center><br /> Davies's family hails from Sierra Leone and Ghana, and she grew up in Massachusetts. Sometimes, she says, she sees a  disconnect  between recent African immigrants and the African-American descendants of slaves.<br /> <br /> But she tries to push back against that disconnect, she said, because  at end of the day it's what you're seen as. <br /> <br /> Davies saw the march as her chance to answer the question of what she would have done if she had been alive during the civil rights protests led by Martin Luther King Jr.<br /> <br /> After hundreds of years of slavery, Jim Crow and more, Davies said,  People continue to get killed. ... It's frustrating.

"More Ferguson Documents Released By St. Louis County Prosecutor"	"<p>A prosecutor released hundreds of pages of additional documents Saturday from the investigation into the police shooting of Michael Brown, including an interview transcript of a friend who initially asserted that he had seen Brown get shot in the back.</p><br />               <p>St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said the newly released records were inadvertently excluded from the thousands of pages of other documents made public Nov. 24, when a grand jury decided not to charge Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for killing Brown.</p><br />               <p>The freshly publicized documents include a transcript of an interview of Brown's friend Dorian Johnson conducted by the FBI and county police just four days after the Aug. 9 confrontation in which the white officer shot the black 18-year-old. Previously released forensic evidence showed that Brown was not shot in the back but was struck by bullets in the head, chest and arm.</p><br />               <p>Johnson's account to investigators was generally similar to his later grand jury testimony, in which he portrayed Wilson as the aggressor during a struggle that began at the officer's vehicle and led to a brief chase before Brown's fatal shooting.</p><br />               <p>In both his original interview and his Sept. 10 grand jury testimony, which was previously released, Johnson said that Wilson reached out of his vehicle window toward Brown's throat or shirt. During the ensuring struggle, Johnson said he never saw Brown touch Wilson's gun.</p><br />               <p>Wilson told grand jurors that Brown grabbed ahold of his weapon and twisted it toward the officer's leg. The officer eventually fired his gun from inside the vehicle. Forensic evidence showed that Brown's hand was shot at close range. Brown and Johnson then ran.</p><br />               <p>In his August interview, Johnson initially was adamant that he had seen Johnson get shot in the back while running.</p><br />               <p> It definitely struck him in his back,  Johnson said, later adding:  It caused him to stop. </p><br />               <p>Asked by a detective how he knew Brown had been shot in the back, Johnson replied:  If it would've missed him, or if he wouldn't have felt it, I believe he would've kept runnin. </p><br />               <p>Under further questioning, Johnson later acknowledged that he didn't see a bullet hit Brown's back, but he remained adamant that Brown's back was toward Wilson when he fired a shot.</p><br />               <p>By almost all witness accounts, Brown turned at some point to face the officer.</p><br />               <p>Johnson described Brown's hands as being raised, one higher than the other. Wilson told grand jurors that one of Brown's hands was clenched in a fist and the other at his waist as Brown began charging back at Wilson.</p><br />               <p>As with the previously released grand jury documents, the witness transcripts released Saturday varied in their accounts of Brown's hands. One witness said Brown's  hands kinda went up.  Another said Brown's hands were up briefly but he then ran toward Wilson. Another said Brown threw up his hands and said something that sounded like,  Don't kill me. </p><br />               <p>Among the documents released Saturday was a witness list, with all of the names of the witnesses whited out. It shows that 62 people testified before the grand jury between Aug. 20 and Nov. 21, including some who appeared multiple times. Some of the people interviewed by federal authorities did not testify before the grand jury.</p><br />               <p>McCulloch apologized in a written statement for any confusion that may have occurred by failing to initially release all of the interview transcripts. He said he believes he has now released all of the grand jury evidence, except for photos of Brown's body and anything that could lead to witnesses being identified.</p><br />               <p>___</p><br />               <p>Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.

"Ted Cruz Mocks GOP Leaders, Sparks Marathon Weekend Session On Spending Bill"	"WASHINGTON -- The Senate is all but guaranteed to pass a $1.1 trillion grab-bag funding bill to keep the government open. But the effort to pass the bill has been fraught with drama, as a simmering feud between Republican leaders and the conservative wing of their party led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sparked an unusual weekend voting marathon Saturday.<br /> <br /> It all started Friday evening when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) rejected an offer from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to push ahead with the funding bill, as well as measures that extend expiring tax breaks and the federally backed terrorism insurance program. <br /> <br /> Reid objected because he also wanted to approve about 20 of President Barack Obama’s nominees before the Senate left session.<br /> <br /> The resulting arrangement was that the Senate would approve a short stopgap funding bill on Friday, take a break, then finish most remaining business by Monday night, including the controversial funding bill that will keep the government running through September.<br /> <br /> McConnell even left the Capitol around 9 p.m,, telling reporters he’d see them Monday.<br /> <br /> But soon thereafter, Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) headed to the Senate floor and objected, blocking the short stopgap and forcing the chamber into session on Saturday. The two conservative senators are demanding a vote on a point of order, raised by Cruz, that questions the validity of the entire spending bill. The move is an effort to object to President Barack Obama's executive action sparing up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.<br /> <br /> Cruz questioned whether America should trust McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to follow through on their pledges to fight Obama on immigration. The two leaders convinced their members not to use the funding measure for battles over immigration or the Affordable Care Act. Boehner and McConnell got Republicans to agree to fund most of the government, but leave the Department of Homeland Security with only enough cash to run through February, at which time the leaders promised to challenge Obama’s immigration orders.<br /> <br /> “I take them at their word because the alternative would be that elected leaders were saying something to the American people they don't believe, and they don't intend to follow through on,” Cruz said during a long floor speech. <br /> <br /> But, he added, “I would note that a whole lot of citizens across this country feel a little bit like Charlie Brown with Lucy and the football, where in fight after fight leadership in Congress says, ‘We'll fight next time -- not this time, no, no, no. The wise thing to do is to fight in a month, fight in two months, fight in thee months.  <br /> <br /> “There comes a point when Charlie Brown has kicked the football and fallen on his rear end one too many times,  Cruz said.<br /> <br /> While Reid had hoped for a break, Lee blocked that plan, saying, “I don’t see any reason why the United States Senate should suspend its operations while the American people are waiting for us to act.”<br /> <br /> Ironically, Cruz and Lee's objections actually sped of the process of passing the funding bill. Without the break, the Senate will hold its final procedural vote on the spending bill around 1 a.m. Sunday, then pass it Monday at about 7 a.m.<br /> <br /> Cruz said his goal was to put senators on the record as to whether or not they support Obama’s “illegal amnesty.”<br /> <br /> Reid and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) made sure to highlight Cruz and Lee's mini-revolt when they opened up Saturday's vote-a-rama. The Democratic senators noted that Cruz was mostly criticizing members of his own party, the same way he did last year before leading fellow conservatives in a push to defund Obamacare, which resulted in a government shutdown.<br /> <br /> “I might just ask the majority leader, this is the same senator who shut down the government last year in protest over the Affordable Care Act?  Durbin asked Reid in a brief colloquy.<br /> <br /> “The very same man,  Reid responded.  Now he's hung up on not only the Affordable Care Act, but the president's action to give 5 million people relief in this country so they can come out of the shadows and make this country a more productive place. <br /> <br /> The spending bill is also being criticized from the left, with a group of lawmakers led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) complaining about provisions that allow wealthy donors to give even more money to political parties and ease the Dodd-Frank bill's restrictions on banks making risky trades.<br /> <br /> Funding for the government is set to run out at midnight Saturday, but the House of Representatives has already passed a separate measure that authorizes spending until Wednesday. The Senate can pass that whenever it needs to, as long as none of its members object. <br /> <br /> <strong>UPDATE</strong>, 4:00 p.m. -- The Senate passed the stopgap funding by unanimous consent Saturday afternoon, giving it until Wednesday to pass full funding.<br /> <br /> <strong>UPDATE</strong>, 10:30 p.m. -- Cruz and Lee relented, letting the Senate vote on the  cromnibus  Saturday night, but they lost the vote on their point of order, 22 to 74, and the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/13/cromnibus-senate_n_6321144.html  target= _hplink >funding passed</a>.<br /> <br /> <br /> <em>Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.

"Sony Hackers Stole Script From New James Bond Film"	"<br>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Early villains have emerged in the next James Bond film  SPECTRE : hackers who stole a version of the screenplay as part of a devastating cyberattack on Sony Pictures.</br>               <br>Producers of the James Bond films said they learned on Saturday morning that an early version of the  SPECTRE  script was among material stolen and made public by hackers who infiltrated computers at the Sony studio.</br>               <br> Eon Productions is concerned that third parties who have received the stolen screenplay may seek to publish it or its contents,  Eon said in a statement, while warning that the script is protected by U.K. copyright laws. </br>               <br> SPECTRE,  starring Daniel Craig as 007, is set for release on Nov. 6, 2015.

"Will Robotics Breed a New Generation of Super Professionals?"	"Every year, there are a few unavoidable topics as you scroll through your newsfeed. Throughout 2014, a main one has been industrial automation -- specifically how the expected sharp rise in robotics investments over the coming years has the potential to cause mass unemployment in the industrial sector. Fear mongers and more rational thinkers alike seem to agree there's cause for concern.<br /> <br /> However, while the next generation of industrial automation is poised to make some jobs obsolete, it's important to remember this isn't the first major industrial transformation. And if the past has taught us anything, it's that technological evolution is consistently accompanied by workforce evolution. There may be fewer jobs in the future, but there will also be more skill requirements as well as higher pay.<br /> <br /> The question is: Will automation enable a generation of super industrial professionals?<br /> <br /> <strong>Centuries of Technological and Workforce Advancement</strong><br /> <br /> If you look back at the history of advancement in the industrial sector, every year seems to be more exciting than the last. The graphic below based on research from <a href= http://www.dfki.de/web/welcome?set_language=en  target= _hplink >the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence</a> details some of these advancements, over the course of four industrial revolutions from the 1700s through present day and into the future.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-industry4.0.png ><img alt= 2014-12-12-industry4.0.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-industry4.0-thumb.png  width= 570  height= 218  /></a><br /> <br /> Although the graphic focuses mainly on technology leading up to what many today are calling  Industry 4.0,  it leaves out workforce--the people developing and using the technologies. If it were to discuss the workforce, it wouldn't be too far off to have a similar key on the side that read  Degree of Knowledge and Power of Workers,  because increasing technology complexity tends to be an enabler of this.<br /> <br /> At each transition point along the way, worker count tended to decrease in what was the primary area, but growth was experienced in consequent engineering,  programming,  and maintenance areas. Initially, it was a shift away from the lone craftsman, with very low volume, to higher volume. But then companies needed mechanical engineers to design for steam power and mechanics. Fast forward into the future with robots and IoT, and it will be embedded systems design engineers, and other highly-skilled techs to keep it all running and moving forward.<br /> <br /> Where we are today, at the beginning of Industry 4.0, is largely characterized by the unprecedented convergence of virtual and real words, rapidly increasing connectivity, <a href= http://blog.lnsresearch.com/blog/bid/200835/Big-Data-The-One-Question-Manufacturers-Really-Want-Answered  target= _hplink >an onslaught of structured and unstructured data</a>, and--most relevant to this discussion--advancements in industrial automation. The impact to workers and businesses in each of these areas is significant, especially in the latter.<br /> <br /> For businesses, fact of the matter is, it's starting to make more sense to invest in robotics. In the right scenarios, the ROI could exceed that of a human worker. The challenge is, those scenarios tend to be where a large chunk of industrial professionals make their living--doing things that are repeatable like assembly and order fulfillment--hence, the socioeconomic implications and the newsfeed buzz.<br /> <br /> <strong>Addressing the Changing and Evolving Workforce</strong><br /> <br /> For anyone skeptical about the shift toward more automation and less humans, MIT Technology Review <a href= http://www.technologyreview.com/graphiti/529971/robots-rising/  target= _hplink >shared an infographic back in August</a> that puts things into perspective. It shows dramatic change in some nations' workforce, and this data was based on 2009 through 2012. Much has changed since then. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-mitreview.png ><img alt= 2014-12-12-mitreview.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-mitreview-thumb.png  width= 570  height= 355  /></a><br /> <br /> But this isn't necessarily the worst of news. Gary Frank, VP of Automated Systems at Westfalia Technologies Inc., commented on the issue of workers being replaced by robots in a recent article he wrote for Automation.com.<br /> <br /> He said,  Contrary to the commonly held belief that automation technology is destroying millions of jobs and displacing workers across the country, today's job market is not vanishing, but rather evolving. While there are surely some jobs rendered obsolete due to automation, workers are still needed, but for higher-level, more tech-related jobs. <br /> <br /> So, what may be worse news is this: With so many baby boomers expected to retire in the next ten to 15 years, and the slow pace of younger people choosing industrial careers, this is a concerning time for such a transformation to happen. A skills gap has been emerging in recent years, and the rise of robotics and other forms of next-gen industrial automation is poised to only widen that gap if nothing changes.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Robots Are Coming! What Needs to Change?</strong><br /> <br /> If all continues down the path toward more automation, several things can be deduced from the points above.<br /> <br /> First, there may have never been a better time for younger generations to start down the path toward a manufacturing career--skills not only equal job security, but also probably increasingly higher pay over time. I've discussed <a href= http://blog.lnsresearch.com/blog/bid/196935/7-Things-Attracting-the-Youth-to-American-Manufacturing  target= _hplink >how we can attract the youth to manufacturing</a> numerous times before, and I don't expect we'll stop discussing it in the near future. Thanks to many businesses, communities, manufacturers, universities, associations, and municipalities, we seem to be moving in the right direction.<br /> <br /> Second, many workers in the industrial setting have already been impacted by automation. The result has not necessarily been to replace them, but rather for their responsibilities to evolve. For instance, especially in smaller plants, it's not totally uncommon for the maintenance tech or a machine operator to also participate in quality audits. With more free time, value has to be added somewhere. The key is for workers to always adapt their skillset and remain relevant to the organization.<br /> <br /> And finally, it should not go without saying that although manufacturing organizations will be recruiting for and funding these highly-skilled jobs, they are not without guilt when it comes to the lack of eligible workers. Despite the very cool technology that many younger people would be happy to work with, manufacturing definitely has an image problem, and it's largely going to fall on these companies to communicate that it's not the same as it used to be.<br /> <br /> <strong>So, What About the Super Industrial Professionals?</strong><br /> <br /> As jobs become more technology and service-based, average workers will be skilled in ways which prior generations couldn't have dreamed of -- so, yes, perhaps professionals will have  super  skills in that respect. The point is, rapid transformation is already starting, prospective workers, current industrial professionals, and manufacturing organizations should be doing everything possible now to be on the right side of it.<br /> <br /> <em>This article originally appeared on <a href= http://blog.lnsresearch.com  target= _hplink >LNS Research's Operational Excellence blog</a>.</em> If you're interested in emerging tech, follow Mike Roberts at <a href= http://www.twitter.com/mp_roberts  target= _hplink >@mp_roberts</a>.

"Dark Matter Signal May Have Been Found In Mysterious X-Ray Data"	"After a decades-long search, astronomers may finally have found the <a href= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-12/epfd-rdp121114.php  target= _hplink >first sign of dark matter</a>. That's the <a href= http://home.web.cern.ch/about/physics/dark-matter  target= _hplink >invisible substance that scientists believe makes up the bulk of our universe</a>, since visible matter accounts for only about 20 percent of our universe's mass. <br /> <br /> While scientists can observe dark matter indirectly by looking at its gravitational effects on visible matter, they have struggled to come up with tangible evidence that proves the stuff exists--until now. <br /> <br /> This week, a team of researchers from Switzerland and the Netherlands announced that they may have detected the signal of decaying dark matter particles. <br /> <br /> For the research, the team analyzed the x-rays emitted from two celestial objects: the <a href= http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2014/perseus/  target= _hplink >Perseus galaxy cluster</a>, an array of galaxies located approximately 250 million light years from Earth, and our <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy  target= _hplink > sister  galaxy Andromeda</a>, which is approximately 2.5 million light years away. The researchers looked at data collected by the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope and spotted a mysterious  anomaly  that could not have been emitted by any known atom or particle.<br /> <br /> The <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/x-rays-dark-matter_n_5528961.html  target= _hplink >same strange x-ray spike was also detected</a> by a research team at Harvard in June, who announced they had spotted the emission in data from 70 different galaxy clusters.<br /> <br />  This tiny (several hundred extra photons) excess has been interpreted as originating from very rare decays of dark matter particles,  Dr. Alexey Boyarsky, a professor of physics at Leiden University in the Netherlands and the lead researcher for the new study, told The Huffington Post in an email.  Although the signal is very weak, it has passed several 'sanity checks' that one expects from a decaying dark matter signal. <br /> <br /> For instance, the researchers say the signal was more concentrated in the center and weak at the edges of Andromeda and the Perseus cluster, which corresponds to what they expected. Boyarsky added that the team has now found a signal at the same wave length coming from our own galaxy, the Milky Way.<br /> <br /> Boyarsky and his team believe the signal comes from the decay of a dark matter particle, possibly a  sterile neutrino,  which is a hypothetical particle believed to be <a href= http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2014/02/x-rays-other-galaxies-could-emanate-particles-dark-matter  target= _hplink >1/100th the size of an electron</a>. <br /> <br />  Confirmation of this discovery may lead to construction of new telescopes specially designed for studying the signals from dark matter particles,  Boyarsky said in a written statement.  We will know where to look in order to <a href= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-12/epfd-rdp121114.php  target= _hplink >trace dark structures in space</a> and will be able to reconstruct how the Universe has formed. <br /> <br /> The research is scheduled to be published next week in the journal Physical Review Letters.

"Research Links Addictive Social Media Behavior With Substance Abuse"	"Plenty of research has demonstrated that the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-judson-brewer/social-media-addiction_b_4079697.html  target= _hplink >addictive quality of social media</a> is very real. And according to a new study, heavy social media use may also contribute to a different type of addiction. <br /> <br /> Psychologists at the University of Albany found that not only is social media (particularly Facebook) itself potentially addictive, those who use it may also be at greater risk for impulse-control issues like substance abuse. <br /> <br /> The researchers surveyed 253 undergraduate students, asking questions about their social media use, Internet addiction, emotion regulation and alcohol use. They found that roughly 10 percent of users experience  disordered social media use,  meaning that they exhibit addictive behaviors in the way they use platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. To assess disordered social media use, the researchers included questions that reflected modified diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, such as,  How good does Facebook make you feel?  and  Do you check Facebook first thing when you wake up in the morning?  <br /> <br /> Those who were struggling with social media addiction were more likely to report Internet addiction (as measured by scores on the <a href= http://netaddiction.com/internet-addiction-test/  target= _hplink >Young Internet Addiction Test</a>), challenges with emotion regulation (such as poor impulse control), and drinking problems. <br /> <br /> Psychologist Julia Hormes, who led the study, said that Facebook was found to have especially addictive properties. The respondents spent an average of one-third of their online browsing time on Facebook, and 67 percent received Facebook push notifications on their phones.  <br /> <br />  New notifications or the latest content on your newsfeed acts as a reward. Not being able to predict when new content is posted encourages us to check back frequently,  <a href= http://www.albany.edu/news/56604.php  target= _hplink >Hormes said in a statement</a>.  This uncertainty about when a new reward is available is known as a 'variable interval schedule of reinforcement' and is highly effective in establishing habitual behaviors that are resistant to extinction. Facebook is also making it easy for users to continuously be connected to its platform, for example by offering push notifications to mobile devices. <br /> <br /> The researchers hypothesize that disordered social media use is likely a symptom of poor emotion regulation skills, which heightens susceptibility to a variety of types of addiction. <br /> <br /> “Our findings suggest that disordered online social networking may arise as part of a cluster of risk factors that increase susceptibility to both substance and non-substance addictions,” <a href= http://www.albany.edu/news/56604.php  target= _hplink >Hormes said</a>. <br /> <br /> The new findings join a growing body of research investigating the addictive potential of Internet social media use. MRI data has shown that the brains of compulsive Internet users to <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/30/shocking-ways-internet-rewires-brain_n_4136942.html  target= _hplink >exhibit similar changes </a>to those seen in people with alcohol and drug addictions. Harvard <a href= http://www.pnas.org/content/109/21/8038.abstract  target= _hplink >research conducted in 2012</a> provided some insight into why using Facebook in particular seems to be so highly addictive. Disclosing information about ourselves, the researchers found, is intrinsically rewarding. It activates the Nucleas Accumbens, a brain area that also lights up when cocaine or other drugs are ingested. But it's not just posting on Facebook that's addictive -- it's also receiving all those likes and comments. Another study found that receiving <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-judson-brewer/social-media-addiction_b_4079697.html  target= _hplink >positive feedback about ourselves</a> also activates the brain's reward centers. <br /> <br /> However, Hormes' and other research can't be taken as conclusive evidence that disordered social media use constitutes a full-blown addiction. <br /> <br />  The question of whether or not disordered online social networking use can be considered a 'true' addiction is a tough one,  Hormes said in an email to the Huffington Post.  I think the answer really depends on your definition of 'addiction.' Many people think of addictions as involving ingested substances. However, if we think about addiction more broadly as involving some kind of reward then it is easier to see how behaviors may be addictive. <br /> <br /> The new findings were published in the December issue of the journal <em>Addiction</em>.

"Jeffrey Marsh, Vine Star, Discusses Their Work As An Activist"	"<strong>Editor's Note</strong>: <em>Jeffrey Marsh is open to the use of any pronoun but for the purposes of this profile, we are using  they/them/their. </em><br /> <br /> You may not know who they are -- but you've no doubt heard their message.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://jeffreymarsh.com/  target= _hplink >Jeffrey Marsh</a> is a social media star who <a href= http://vine.co/jeffreymarsh  target= _hplink >utilizes Vine</a> to spread messages of positivity and awareness on a massive digital platform. Their Vines have collectively received more than 90 million views, ultimately providing Marsh with the opportunity to take their message outside of social media and speak and perform all over New York City.<br /> <br /> Marsh is most notably known for spearheading the viral hashtags #DontSayThatsSoGay and #NoTimetoHateMyself.<br /> <br /> In the technological age, the face of activism has evolved along with the way in which we communicate. Marsh is part of a generation of LGBTQ activists who, through social media, are changing minds and perceptions in parts of the world where people may not encounter a queer person in their day to day lives.<br /> <br /> The Huffington Post chatted with Marsh this week about their work as an activist, the way in which they utilize social media and what they have planned for the future.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Huffington Post: How did you become a Vine star? </strong><br /> <a href= http://jeffreymarsh.com/  target= _hplink >Jeffrey Marsh</a>: By accident! I'm doing what I always did: dress up like Julie Andrews, dance around, tell people they're awesome as heck, sing them songs and (literally) kick up my heels to some catchy Katy Perry.<br />  <br /> The only difference now is the camera, the chance to post those moments for gay kids in Arkansas and Canadian moms. No other form of social media I've tried allows me to immediately connect like Vine does. It is very much like a face-to-face social experience. Each day I'm shocked and excited to find messages from people who feel like my videos help them to be themselves. I guess I became a  star  by being myself. <br /> <br /> <strong>When did you realize that things were really heating up and people were starting to take notice?</strong><br /> That's the funny thing, it was so gradual -- so natural. There are plenty of people in social media who burn brightly and fast, who go viral and get (almost) instant fame. For whatever reason, my journey so far has been consistent and incremental. I picture one friend telling another; a grass roots approach to fame. <br /> <br /> It would be hard to argue that my message isn't popular. But is it the most popular? Not by a long shot. I'm reminded of Joan Rivers talking about some advice she once got: if 0.1% of America thinks you're funny, you'll fill stadiums for the rest of your life. I'm not sure I will ever fill a stadium, but I think Joan and I are both talking about quality over quantity. This is most true when it comes to cultivating a relationship with the like-minded people who call themselves fans. And I'm happy to say that those fans are all over the figurative (and literal) map: old, young, black, white, trans, bi -- you name it! Everybody is welcome and can hopefully connect with my inclusive message. <br /> <br /> <img alt= jeffrey marsh  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2382524/thumbs/o-JEFFREY-MARSH-570.jpg?8  /><br /> <br /> <strong>Did you have a strategy or a plan in the beginning or were you just creating Vines that felt right to you and putting them out in the world?</strong><br /> Did I have a plan? Definitely not! I always knew I wanted to tell as many people (in as many ways as I could) that there is nothing wrong with them. I just started posting things that brought a smile to my face, that helped me feel excited to post again -- to connect again. <br /> <br /> I don't like dwelling on the  larger  implications of what I'm doing. There have been hundreds of messages from people who decided not to commit suicide because of my channel, for instance. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that's happening! It's just that all I did was look into my iPhone camera and tell a friend they're beautiful for being alive. I don't ever want to lose that connection. Is that simple direct approach a strategy? Maybe it is…<br /> <br /> <iframe class= vine-embed  src= https://vine.co/v/OvjBaZ7Jde1/embed/simple  width= 570  height= 600  frameborder= 0 ></iframe><script async src= //platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js  charset= utf-8 ></script><br /> <br /> <strong>Do you approach your vines differently now than you did at the beginning? What has changed for you?</strong><br /> Maybe part of my success, and the success of Vine overall, is the relatability factor. People can see me; they can look into my eyes, which never happens on Twitter. I've shied away from making more polished,  produced  vines because I'm concerned they will lose a personal touch -- a humanity that is so essential to one of my missions: showing that LGBTQ folks are just folks. We are all human.<br /> <br /> One thing that has changed for me is the recognition of the responsibility I have. I say it in a grandiose way because I don't think I'm representing just LGBTQ folks. I've realized recently that my gender identity is a metaphor. I have the chance to be a voice for many of the voiceless outsiders in the world -- the heartbroken people who have felt left out. If my interactions on Vine are any indication, there are a lot of us out there!<br /> <br /> <strong>What’s it like to see a hashtag campaign you’ve created take off and touch so many people?</strong><br /> It's ultra-fulfilling and fun. To know that people benefit, to know that people get it and are changed by what I do is a reason to get up in the morning. It's also a reason to glue on false lashes when I'm a little tired and skim through hate e-mail to answer my followers. #DontSayThatsSoGay and #NoTimetoHateMyself brought out so many different kinds of people; people who would never be in front of a camera, never would be that visible on social media. They felt the message, their participation was that important. And everyone's participation is that important! It really excites me to see that. Being in front of the camera feels natural for me, but when someone else who might be nervous or shy puts their truth on Vine, it is very inspirational. <br /> <br /> <blockquote class= twitter-tweet  lang= en ><p><a href= https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dontsaythatssogay?src=hash >#Dontsaythatssogay</a> <a href= https://twitter.com/JeffreyMarsh >@jeffreymarsh</a> I am gay.

That's what's important: the connection, the changed lives. I often feel like my life has been changed most of all.<br /> <br /> <strong>When it comes to gender identity and sexual orientation, how would you describe yourself?</strong><br /> I never want anyone to feel bad. Ever. So, I decided a while ago that there is no  wrong way  to refer to me. I know that words and pronouns are really important to a lot of people. I respect that deeply. Several times a week, people ask  what's your preferred pronoun?  which is nice of them, but I have no idea! <br /> <br /> For me, connecting is most important. If someone is being respectful, I don't care what they use. I'd love to have an interaction with someone who says a pronoun that doesn't seem true for me at that moment, and we talk about it -- we connect over it. Excluded from all this is, of course, is hate speech. I just don't engage that. <br /> <br /> I don't want to deflect the heart of the question though! Personally, I don't walk around thinking of myself as  her,   man,   they  or any other word we've currently got going. I guess that's part of why I love hearing everybody's stories on Vine -- I can relate to men and women and everyone. When we're talking about being human and having feelings, there is so much that we have in common.<br /> <br /> <strong>What’s the one thing you hope people take away from what you're doing? If you could boil everything down into one message, what would it be?</strong><br /> Always, always, always the message is the same: There Is Nothing Wrong With You. With varying degrees of success I'm sure, I keep it all hovering around that theme. Tweets, Instagram and, of course, my Vines are all an effort to help people ditch the self-hate and self-judgement. What could be more important? <br /> <br /> <strong>What do you want to accomplish in 2015?</strong><br /> Let's take over the world! I would be very happy if The Message (see above) could reach more people and bring more of us together. Helping one person is a cause for celebration to me, and I plan to keep celebrating that one-at-a-time connection by Vining my heart out. <br /> <br /> <em>Want to see more from Jeffrey Marsh?

"This Map Shows Where America Loves 'Butts' More Than 'Boobs'"	"Americans appear to prefer  butts  to  boobs  when searching for  straight,  woman-with-man pornography on the popular websites Pornhub and Youporn. <br /> <br /> A report on the websites' analytics, titled  Boobs, Butts & Beyond,  shows that butt-related terms top boob queries in 40 of 50 states. The websites, both owned by the same company, developed the report with <a href= http://www.20min.ch/  target= _hplink >20 Minuten</a>, a Swiss newspaper. <br /> <br /> Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine are the only U.S. states where boob searches win out.<br /> <br /> <img src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387234/original.jpg ><br><center><i>Americans apparently prefer  butts  to  boobs.  (<a href= http://www.pornhub.com/insights  target= _hplink >Source</a>)</i></center><br /> <br /> The report was compiled using search data from the past year. It looked at various terms relating to both categories -- synonyms for the body parts in question. <br /> <br /> When the websites looked at global data, Pornhub said in a <a href= http://www.pornhub.com/insights/boobs-butts-legs-feet-searches/  target= _hplink >blog post</a>, they found that  boob  queries appear more popular in northern regions like Canada and the United Kingdom, but  butt  searches pop up more in southern regions like Chile and South Africa.<br /> <br /> <img src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387244/original.jpg ><br><center><i>A look at the world's pornographic leanings.

"For 'The Interview,' Even Negative Publicity (Like A Massive Sony Hack) Is Good Publicity"	"Some bad news for Sony might end up being good news for one of the company's movies. <br /> <br /> A <a href= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/topic/sony-hack  target= _hplink >massive hack</a> of Sony Pictures Entertainment's computer system has been devastating to the studio, leading to leaks of unreleased movies, <a href= http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/12/11/sony-hack-execs-make-racist-jokes-about-barack-obama-listers-slam-those/  target= _hplink >embarrassing emails</a> and <a href= http://time.com/3625392/the-7-most-outrageous-things-we-learned-from-the-sony-hack/  target= _hplink >sensitive employee information</a>. But it has also brought a lot of attention to  The Interview,  the movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that some say prompted the hack. The film, due for release on Christmas Day, has become the topic of <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/world/asia/north-korea-warns-us-over-film-parody.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >countless news stories</a> and social media chatter, likely widening the movie's potential audience. <br /> <br />  It's creating a buzz,  said Steven Fink, who wrote <em>Crisis Management: Planning for the Inevitable</em>.  Wouldn't you want to see what all the hype is about?  <br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788710/  target= _hplink >In the film</a>, Rogen and Franco's characters work for a TV show and score an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. They are recruited by the CIA to assassinate him. Investigators <a href= http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/us-sony-cybersecurity-fbi-idUSKBN0JN1MF20141209?feedType=RSS&  target= _hplink >haven't determined who hacked Sony</a>, but many <a href= http://www.thewrap.com/sony-hack-attack-cybersecurity-firm-says-if-north-korea-was-involved-an-insider-helped/  target= _hplink >suspect</a> North Korean might have been involved, perhaps as retaliation for the film. A North Korean official has <a href= http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30366449  target= _hplink >denied</a> government involvement. <br /> <br /> From Nov. 20 to Dec. 3, a period that includes the first public news of the hack on Nov. 24, views of  The Interview  trailers were up 895 percent from the Nov. 6-19 period, according to data from Tubular Labs, a YouTube analytics company. Sony released a second trailer for the movie during that period as well, which like explains some of the spike in interest. <br /> <br /> But, in its first week, views of the second trailer far outpaced views of second trailers for other Sony movies, indicating the hack could have boosted interest in  The Interview,  according to Tubular. The second trailer for  The Interview  garnered 2.2 million views in its first week, while second trailers for  The Wedding Ringer  and  Annie  reached 815,000 and 400,100 views, respectively, in their first week.<br /> <br /> Allison Stern, the co-founder of Tubular, said  The Interview  content has been around for six months but one-third of the views on it came in the past month -- definitely a  bump  from the expected growth rate.<br /> <br /> Data from Google Trends also suggest the controversy has increased interest in the film:<br /> <br /> <img alt= google trends  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2382160/original.jpg  /><br /> <div style= width:570;font-size:70%; ><center><em>This chart from Google Trends shows the dips and spikes of Google searches for  The Interview.   Birdman,  by comparison, has a less-volatile search history. Sony also released a new trailer for  The Interview  after the hack was publicly known, which likely explains part of the spike in interest. In comparison, the first spike for  Birdman  occurred when its trailer was released and the larger spike happened when the movie opened.</em></center></div><br /> <br /> There's a long history of controversy propelling films, TV shows, books and albums to greater popularity. There's a reason the phrase  there's no such thing as bad publicity  exists. Bad book reviews can actually boost sales by an average of 45 percent if the author is relatively unknown, according to <a href= https://hbr.org/2012/03/bad-reviews-can-boost-sales-heres-why  target= _hplink >a 2012 study</a> from researchers at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford Graduate School of Business.<br /> <br /> Fink, the crisis-management expert, recalled the release of  The China Syndrome,  a 1979 film in which Jane Fonda played a reporter who convinces an engineer to blow the whistle on a dangerous nuclear power plant. The movie opened 12 days before the infamous Three Mile Island nuclear accident. <br /> <br />  I was ecstatic that it was extremely commercially successful,  <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/magazine/16wwln-freakonomics-t.html  target= _hplink >Fonda said of the film in an interview</a> on a retrospective edition of the DVD, according to a 2007 New York Times report.  You know the expression 'We had legs'? We became a caterpillar after Three Mile Island. <br /> <br /> The monthslong controversy over Mel Gibson's 2004 movie  The Passion of the Christ  that included allegations of anti-Semitism likely helped the film earn more than $23 million on its opening day. One of the movie's more prominent detractors, Rabbi Eugene Korn, the former head of interfaith affairs at the Anti-Defamation League, <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/28/arts/agreed-all-the-publicity-is-a-triumph-for-passion.html  target= _hplink >told a 2004 panel</a> that he and other critics made a  strategic error  by arguing over the film in public for so long before its release, the Times reported at the time.  <br /> <br /> Celebrity deaths can have a similar effect. Shortly after actor Heath Ledger died in 2008, sales of his movies spiked and more than 7 million fans raced to YouTube to watch trailers of  The Dark Knight,  the actor's last completed project, <a href= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/2008-01-25-299950782_x.htm  target= _hplink >The Associated Press reported at the time</a>.<br /> <br />  Anything like that happens, it makes you want to go see [the movie],  said Jeff Greenfield, the co-founder of C3 Metrics, a media analytics firm.  It just shows that people tend to like and get attracted to things that are negative.   <br /> <br /> <img alt= the interview movie  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2384876/original.jpg  /><div style= width:570;font-size:70%; ><center><em>Movie posters at the premiere of  The Interview  in Los Angeles earlier this month.</em></center></div><br /> <br /> Of course, any increase in box office sales for the film probably won't outweigh the consequences of the hack for Sony, said Mikey Glazer, a columnist for entertainment website The Wrap. A Sony representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. <br /> <br />  I'm sure it's not something they wished for,  Glazer said. <br /> <br /> One party may get a surprising benefit, though.  In some twisted way, this movie is actually wonderful for North Korea because it makes them out to be a superpower -- at least fictionally -- that the U.S. feels is worthy of assassination,  said Jason Maloni, a senior vice president at crisis communications firm Levick.

"8 Technologies Every Boomer Needs To Learn"	"<img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/NextAveLogo2.jpg  align= left  style= margin: 0px 15px 10px 0px;  /><em><strong>SPECIAL FROM</strong> <a href= http://www.nextavenue.org >Next Avenue</a></em><br><br /> <br /> By Clair Jones<br /> <br /> Have you ever wondered what your Millennial coworkers are doing when they’re glued to their smartphones or tablets? Maybe it’s time to have a closer look.<br />  <br /> They’re likely employing innovative technologies that you, too, should be using to make your job easier and make you more impressive to your current employer or your next one.<br /> <strong> <br /> To stay up-to-date, learn these eight ways that technology can help you at work:</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>1. Manage your personal brand with IFTTT.</strong><br />  <br /> If This Then That (IFTTT) is a free service that makes updating your social media accounts, personal blog or LinkedIn profile easy. It uses what the service calls “recipes” to link your accounts. This way, when you post in one, an update is automatically posted in the others.<br /> <br /> For instance, you can make an IFTTT recipe that updates your LinkedIn Profile every time you publish a new post on your personal blog. <a href= http://lifehacker.com/5842307/how-to-supercharge-all-your-favorite-webapps-with-ifttt  target= _hplink >Guides like this one from Lifehacker</a> provide detail instructions about how best to use the service.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Maximize your workday with <a href= https://calendar.sunrise.am/  target= _hplink >Sunrise.</a> </strong><br /> <br /> Sunrise is a free calendar app that combines Google Calendar with LinkedIn, Facebook and other profile calendars to display a comprehensive view of your day. It lets you see real-time updates to meetings in one place, send messages to meeting attendees from within the app and even adjust your events based on time zone. Sunrise also puts alerts from your Facebook, LinkedIn and other linked accounts into your everyday calendar to ensure you never miss an important date.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Schedule meetings effectively with <a href= https://tools.google.com/dlpage/hangoutplugin  target= _hplink >Google+ Hangouts</a> and <a href= http://doodle.com/  target= _hplink >Doodle.</a></strong><br /> <br /> Google+ Hangouts is a free videoconferencing service that works on any device and allows more flexibility than many of its paid competitors. You can start a videoconference directly inside an email, share your screen and collaborate on Google Docs relatively glitch-free.<br />  <br /> Doodle cooperates with your calendar to make it simple to schedule meetings with multiple participants and avoid overscheduling your time (it’s free or costs $39 a year if you want extra features). You can provide participants with a variety of meeting time options, all of which hover over their calendar. Once a time is chosen, Doodle automatically saves the meeting details. Doodle works seamlessly with different calendar formats.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. Create dynamic work presentations with the <a href= http://prezi.com/  target= _hplink >Prezi </a>and <a href= http://keepvid.com/  target= _hplink >Keepvid</a> web applications.</strong><br />  <br /> If you really want to impress your boss, ditch PowerPoint and use Prezi, whose customizable templates let you create dynamic, individualized presentations. You put in your text and images and then choose a color scheme, theme and filters. Prezi is free if you don’t mind sharing your presentations with its online community or $5 a month if you want to keep them private.<br />  <br /> Frozen video slides can bring even the best-planned presentation to an embarrassing halt. One solution: Keepvid, which lets you download your videos beforehand and save them to your smartphone, computer or tablet free of charge. It’s useful when Internet access is unavailable or unreliable or when you’re in a place where certain websites (like YouTube) are blocked.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Hack graphic design with <a href= http://www.easel.ly/  target= _hplink >Easel.ly.</a></strong><br />  <br /> Easel.ly is an innovative service that lets you choose from hundreds of infographic templates and customize them to suit your needs. Whether you’re creating visual aids for a presentation or making an attention-grabbing image for a report, you can avoid the cost and turnaround time of hiring a designer with this free resource.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>6. Manage projects gracefully with<a href= https://evernote.com/  target= _hplink > Evernote.</a></strong><br />  <br /> This free app, which has taken on cult-like status among its fervent users, makes project management simple and easy. Evernote lets you take notes, capture pictures of visual aids, record audio clips and store important project information in categorical files using one versatile interface. You can either email your files directly to Evernote or store them as you go, using simple tags.<br />  <br /> Evernote is a huge upgrade from run-of-the mill note-taking apps, because it uses secure cloud technology to make finding your information completely seamless when you’re switching devices. In short, it’s more efficient than taking regular notes, especially if you’re prone to misplacing files.<br /> <br /> <strong>7. Protect company and personal data with <a href= https://lastpass.com/  target= _hplink >LastPass.</a></strong><br />  <br /> It’s is a free add-on that makes strong alpha-numeric passwords for each of your accounts, while requiring you to remember only one simple password of your choice. Password data is locally encrypted on your computer, so it’s not sent over the Internet. LastPass is great for protecting yourself when you’re using an unsecured network away from the office.<br /> <br /> <strong>8. Stay abreast of current events with <a href= https://getpocket.com/  target= _hplink >Pocket.</a><br />  </strong><br /> Pocket is a free tool that lets you save for reading later the media that interests you. Say you discover something on your smartphone you don’t have time to look at now or that you’d rather view on a larger screen. Just email a link to your “Pocket,” or download the Pocket browser extension to bookmark relevant media as you discover it.<br />  <br /> You can also use tags to categorize your media.

"Students Give Professors Better Evaluations If They Think They're Male: Study"	"Students tend to give better evaluations to their professors if they think they're male instead of female, according to <a href= http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4  target= _hplink >a study</a> published last week in the journal Innovative Higher Education.<br /> <br /> The study, led by Lillian MacNell, a doctoral student at North Carolina State University, used an online summer course on introductory anthropology and sociology to, essentially, <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfish_%28film%29  target= _hplink >catfish</a> students. The class was divided into four discussion groups, with two assistant instructors, one male and one female, teaching two discussions groups each. The assistant instructors collaborated to write and teach in similar ways. <br /> <br /> However, the male instructor only told one of his groups that he was male, and told his other group he was female. Likewise, the female instructor only told one group she was female, and told her other group she was male.<br /> <br /> At the end of the course, students were asked to fill out an evaluation about their instructor. Overall, the instructors did not receive significantly different evaluations. But the female instructor received better evaluations when students thought she was male. The male instructor, meanwhile, received worse evaluations when students thought he was female.<br /> <br /> <script id= infogram_0_mean-of-student-ratings---male  src= //e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?64g  type= text/javascript ></script><div style= width:100%;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center; ><a target= _blank  href= https://infogr.am/mean-of-student-ratings---male  style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none; >Mean of Student Ratings - Male Instructor</a> |<a style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;  href= https://infogr.am  target= _blank >Create infographics</a></div><br /> <br /> <script id= infogram_0_mean-of-student-ratings---female-instructor  src= //e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?i1m  type= text/javascript ></script><div style= width:100%;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center; ><a target= _blank  href= https://infogr.am/mean-of-student-ratings---female-instructor  style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none; >Mean of Student Ratings - Female Instructor</a> |<a style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;  href= https://infogr.am  target= _blank >Create infographics</a></div><br /> <br /> <br /> The evaluations also included specific questions about how the instructor performed, and the responses to these questions reveal an even deeper bias. Both instructors returned grades to their students after two days. But when students were asked to rate their instructors on promptness, instructors perceived as male received an average rating of 4.35 out of 5, while instructors perceived as females received an average rating of only 3.55.<br /> <br /> Male-perceived instructors also scored higher on questions about interpersonal measures, even though, according to the study,  both actual instructors demonstrated the same level of interpersonal interaction in their attempts to create a sense of immediacy in the online classroom.  The researchers theorized that female instructors are generally expected to have high interpersonal skills -- meaning that a female instructor would have to work harder than a male instructor just to get the same rating.<br /> <br /> The study argues that if these biases are coming across so clearly in teacher evaluations,  this particular form of inequality needs to be taken into consideration as women apply for academic jobs and come up for promotion and review.

"UN Climate Talks In Lima Reach Agreement"	"LIMA, Peru (AP) — After late-night wrangling at U.N. talks in Peru, negotiators early Sunday reached a compromise deal that sets the stage for a global climate pact in Paris next year.<br /> <br /> The main goal for the two-week session in Lima was relatively modest: Reach agreement on what information should go into the pledges that countries submit for a global climate pact expected to be adopted in Paris. But even that became complicated as several developing nations rebelled against a draft decision they said blurred the distinction between what rich and poor countries can be expected to do. The Lima agreement was adopted hours after a previous draft was rejected by developing countries who accused rich nations of shirking their responsibilities to fight global warming and pay for its impacts.<br /> <br /> Peru's environment minister presented a new, fourth draft just before midnight and said he hoped it would satisfy all parties, giving a sharply reduced body of remaining delegates an hour to review it.<br /> <br />  As a text it's not perfect, but it includes the positions of the parties,  said the minister, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who was the conference chairman and had spent all afternoon and evening meeting separately with delegations.<br /> <br /> The final draft apparently alleviated those concerns with language saying countries have  common but differentiated responsibilities  to deal with global warming. It also restored language demanded by small island states at risk of being flooded by rising seas, mentioning a  loss and damage  mechanism agreed upon in last year's talks in Poland.<br /> <br />  We need a permanent arrangement to help the poorest of the world,  Ian Fry, negotiator for the Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu, said at a midday session.<br /> <br /> However, it weakened language on the content of the pledges, saying they  may  instead of  shall  include quantifiable information showing how countries intend to meet their emissions targets.  Also, top carbon polluter China and other major developing countries opposed plans for a review process that would allow the pledges to be compared against one another before Paris.<br /> <br /> The new draft mentioned only that all pledges would be reviewed a month ahead Paris to assess their combined effect on climate change.<br /> <br />  I think it's definitely watered down from what we expected,  said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists.<br /> <br /> Sam Smith, chief of climate policy for the environmental group WWF, said:  The text went from weak to weaker to weakest and it's very weak indeed. <br /> <br /> Though negotiating tactics always play a role, virtually all disputes in the U.N. talks reflect a wider issue of how to divide the burden of fixing the planetary warming that scientists say results from human activity, primarily the burning of oil, coal and natural gas.<br /> <br /> The momentum from last month's joint U.S.-China deal on emissions targets faded quickly in Lima as rifts reopened over who should do what to fight the problem.<br /> <br /> Historically, Western nations are the biggest emitters. Currently, most CO2 emissions are coming from developing countries as they grow their economies and lift millions of people out of poverty.<br /> <br /> During a brief stop in Lima on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said fixing the problem was  everyone's responsibility, because it's the net amount of carbon that matters, not each country's share. <br /> <br /> According to the U.N.'s scientific panel on climate change, the world can pump out no more than about 1 trillion tons of carbon to have a likely chance of avoiding dangerous levels of warming. It already has spent more than half of that carbon budget as emissions continue to rise, driven by growth in China and other emerging economies.<br /> <br /> Scientific reports say climate impacts are already happening and include rising sea levels, intensifying heat waves and shifts in weather patterns causing floods in some areas and droughts in others.<br /> <br /> The U.N. weather agency said last week that 2014 could become the hottest year on record.<br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Associated Press writers Frank Bajak and Nestor Ikeda contributed to this report."

His mother  told CNN her son was bipolar, and had previously tried to enter  North Korea from the South Korean side.</br>                <br> He is very smart and he got the court to let him out and  instead of coming home to us he bought a ticket and left for  China,  the television news channel quoted Patricia Eugenia  Martinez as saying.</br>                <br>No official statement had been released by North Korean  media as of early Sunday afternoon.</br>                <br>In September, South Korean media reported that a man in his  late 20s had been arrested by South Korean marines for swimming  in a river that flows towards North Korea. The man had been  trying to go to the North to meet its leader, local media  reported at the time.</br>                <br>It was not immediately clear how or why Martinez entered  North Korea. A North Korean statement seen by CNN said Martinez  entered the country two days after U.S. intelligence official  James Clapper arrived in Pyongyang to negotiate the release of  detained Americans Matthew Miller and Kenneth Bae.</br>                <br>Miller and Bae had both been serving hard labor sentences  in North Korea for breaking local laws, but were released in  November. A third detained U.S. citizen, Jeffrey Fowle, was  released in October.</br>                <br> (I am) extremely grateful for having been pardoned from the  punishments given to violators of these laws, and for the most  generous reception I have received,  CNN reported Martinez as  saying in his statement, which criticized America's politicians,  police, foreign policy and the electoral system.

"Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong, Early November 2014"	"<em>Text by Alan Reade <br /> Photos by Tommy Wu</em><br /> <br /> We were on vacation in Hong Kong in early November 2014, and not once but twice, we wandered unexpectedly into the sites are where large groups of Hong Kongese, particularly students, have been petitioning nonviolently for democracy. The Hong Kong pro-democracy movement is known as Occupy Central with Love & Peace, or OCLP. But most people know it as the Umbrella Movement.<br /> <br /> Hong Kong, a former British colony, has experienced some autonomy from mainland China but was returned to China in 1997. OCLP has been pressuring the communist Chinese government to grant Hong Kong the right to elect its own officials in the Hong Kong Chief Executive election in 2017 instead of candidates that Beijing screens and approves. <br /> <br /> One thing that surprised us is the sheer size of the Umbrella Movement. Especially in the Admiralty area, we saw acres of tents taking up space in building corridors, part of a subway station, and some offramps and pedestrian bridges in the midst of what is normally a busy business area of Hong Kong. So much of Hong Kong is crowded, honking, and loud, but there was a comforting yet almost eerie silence the day we were walking through the Admiralty site.<br /> <br /> What struck us most about both protest sites was the creativity: thousands and thousands of drawings and sculptures made of found objects, in front of tents, affixed to posts, and sometimes spanning entire walls of buildings. One man from mainland China had come to the protest site to plant a garden of edible plants in what we assume had been an urban flower display.<br /> <br /> Maybe the eeriness we sensed was the calm before the proverbial storm: Later in November, the police started breaking up both protest sites, with many officers continuing tactics of violence toward the protesters. We don't know what is left of either site now. And so we offer this photo essay as a document to what was there in early November 2014.<br /> <br /> <<HH--236SLIDEPOLLAJAX--389242--HH>> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 15:49:47 -0500"	"world"

"Sweden: Russian Military Jet Nearly Collides With Passenger Plane"	"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — For the second time this year, a Russian military aircraft turned off its transponders to avoid commercial radar and nearly collided with a passenger jet over Sweden, officials said Saturday.<br /> <br />  This is serious. This is inappropriate. This is outright dangerous when you turn off the transponder,  Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said on Swedish radio. Officials at Russia's Ministry of Defense in Moscow were not immediately available to comment Saturday.<br /> <br /> In recent months, Russia has increased its military presence in the Baltic Sea area, prompting some Swedish officials to compare it to the Cold War. In October, non-NATO Sweden launched its first submarine hunt since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Swedish authorities said a small, foreign submarine had entered its waters illegally but never found it and didn't disclose its nationality.<br /> <br /> NATO has air patrols over the Baltic Sea and the continuous rotation of NATO military units in and out of countries such as the Baltic states and Poland.<br /> <br /> On Saturday, Swedish authorities said a Russian military aircraft nearly collided above southern Sweden with a commercial passenger jet that had taken off on Friday from Copenhagen.<br /> <br /> Sweden's air force chief, Maj. Gen. Micael Byden, said the aircraft's transponders, which make the plane visible to commercial radar, were shut off.  Swedish fighter jets were sent up to identify the aircraft, and Hultqvist later identified it as a Russian intelligence plane.<br /> <br /> Byden said the incident in international air space looked  pretty serious,  adding the southern-bound commercial flight was immediately ordered to change course. Media in Sweden and Denmark said the commercial plane was en route to Poland, but no one identified the airline that was flying the jet or how many people it was carrying.<br /> <br /> Byden said this was not as serious as in March when a Russian plane flying without transponders came within 100 meters (300 feet) of an SAS plane that had taken off from Copenhagen.<br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> AP correspondent Laura Mills contributed from Moscow."

"How Countries Around The World Are Coping With Falling Oil Prices"	"<em>Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we look at the impact of a steep decline in oil prices.</em><br /> <br /> On Friday, the price of benchmark crude oil dropped to new <a href= http://finance.yahoo.com/news/brent-hits-five-half-low-034420232.html  target= _hplink >five-year lows</a>. <br /> <br /> The price of oil has been plummeting for months, leaving oil-producing nations around the world <a href= http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-30/oil-at-40-possible-as-market-transforms-caracas-to-iran.html  target= _hplink >aghast</a> at their sinking revenues. Poor global economic growth has cut demand, while the U.S. is producing oil <a href= http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-11/wti-trades-near-61-as-saudis-question-need-for-production-cut.html  target= _hplink >faster than ever recorded</a>.  <br /> <br /> Prices fell further last month after Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies <a href= http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/28/us-opec-meeting-idUSKCN0JA0O320141128  target= _hplink >blocked an effort </a>at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce production levels in order to boost the price of oil.<br /> <br /> The OPEC episode shows that it's not only economists and oil barons who are concerned about the price crash. Many major oil producers are embroiled in domestic and international political crises, and political analysts are <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/12/03/falling-oil-prices-more-peace/  target= _hplink >watching closely</a> to see how these countries react as revenues continue to decline.

Saudi Arabia is signaling that if OPEC needs to cut production levels, they want other exporters who are not members of OPEC to cut their production as well.<br /> <br /> What’s changed fundamentally in the market in the last few years is the dramatic increase in U.S. oil production. There are few other instances in history when oil production has grown so quickly. I think we’re still learning a lot about U.S. oil production. Other oil producers are opting to wait and see what happens, and then take a decision. <br /> <br /> Often in the past, OPEC has only agreed to production cuts after a few meetings and an increased sense of panic. It is certainly possible that the oil price will decline further and U.S. production will keep growing, and OPEC will have to take action. <br /> <br /> <strong>If the price keeps falling, could this backfire on the Saudi regime by undermining stability in the country?</strong><br /> <br /> Saudi Arabia has very costly social programs and welfare spending. I imagine the Saudi regime is concerned about the possibility of instability. But they are in a better position than other producers. They have huge financial reserves. If they decide to run a deficit for a while, they could handle it.<br /> <br /> <strong>What about the other major oil-producing nations?</strong><br /> <br /> There are very significant risks to the stability of these countries. Nigeria and Venezuela are going to be in an extremely painful position over the next year. Their economies have already suffered. Venezuela supports a subsidized oil price for regional allies, which is pushing them towards the risk of default.<br /> <br /> <strong>Do you think trouble in the oil markets could pressure Iran to reach a deal over its nuclear program, or curb Russia's military ambitions?</strong><br /> <br /> Russia is facing extreme pressure from the price collapse as well as international sanctions. The ruble has already fallen sharply. Iran is also suffering from sanctions as well as the oil price. I hope the low price will provide an opportunity for the West to exert greater leverage to push for agreement with Iran and Russia, but it's hard to say how these countries will respond. <br /> <br /> As Iran continues to negotiate with the international community over its nuclear program, the sharp fall in the price of oil is an additional reason for accommodating sooner rather than later. The flip side is that the lower oil price could make it easier for the U.S. Congress to ratchet up sanctions on Iran. <br /> <br /> [Russian President] Vladimir Putin has shown much less willingness to move forward. I don’t think that we’ve seen signals that he will pull back from aggression in Ukraine. His popularity remains high despite the economic pain. <br /> <br /> <strong>What do you expect to happen next to the price of oil?</strong><br /> <br /> It’s very hard to predict. If you had asked me two months ago I would not have predicted where we are today. <br /> <br /> I don't think we’re yet at the bottom price. It will fall further, and then begin picking back up again in the next year. I think demand will pick up because of the lower price, and supply will grow less quickly. But how fast it will rise, and to what level, is hard to say.<br /> <br /> <em>This interview has been edited for clarity.</em> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 11:27:05 -0500"	"world"
"Dark Matter Signal May Have Been Found In Mysterious X-Ray Data"	"After a decades-long search, astronomers may finally have found the <a href= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-12/epfd-rdp121114.php  target= _hplink >first sign of dark matter</a>.

The researchers looked at data collected by the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope and spotted a mysterious  anomaly  that could not have been emitted by any known atom or particle.<br /> <br /> The <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/x-rays-dark-matter_n_5528961.html  target= _hplink >same strange x-ray spike was also detected</a> by a research team at Harvard in June, who announced they had spotted the emission in data from 70 different galaxy clusters.<br /> <br />  This tiny (several hundred extra photons) excess has been interpreted as originating from very rare decays of dark matter particles,  Dr. Alexey Boyarsky, a professor of physics at Leiden University in the Netherlands and the lead researcher for the new study, told The Huffington Post in an email.  Although the signal is very weak, it has passed several 'sanity checks' that one expects from a decaying dark matter signal. <br /> <br /> For instance, the researchers say the signal was more concentrated in the center and weak at the edges of Andromeda and the Perseus cluster, which corresponds to what they expected. Boyarsky added that the team has now found a signal at the same wave length coming from our own galaxy, the Milky Way.<br /> <br /> Boyarsky and his team believe the signal comes from the decay of a dark matter particle, possibly a  sterile neutrino,  which is a hypothetical particle believed to be <a href= http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2014/02/x-rays-other-galaxies-could-emanate-particles-dark-matter  target= _hplink >1/100th the size of an electron</a>. <br /> <br />  Confirmation of this discovery may lead to construction of new telescopes specially designed for studying the signals from dark matter particles,  Boyarsky said in a written statement.  We will know where to look in order to <a href= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-12/epfd-rdp121114.php  target= _hplink >trace dark structures in space</a> and will be able to reconstruct how the Universe has formed. <br /> <br /> The research is scheduled to be published next week in the journal Physical Review Letters. A <a href= http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.4119v1.pdf  target= _hplink >pre-printed version of the article</a> can be found here. "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 10:05:39 -0500"	"world"

Many have been placed in purpose-built refugee camps but the huge numbers mean thousands of others are forced to live in un-finished buildings or inadequate, makeshift shelters and as winter in the region closes in, there are growing concerns for the welfare of the refugees who, while their homes are still in ISIL controlled territory, have no realistic prospect of returning to them. <br /> <br /> <strong>Mexico City, Mexico: December 12<br /> </strong><img alt= religion  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388486/thumbs/o-RELIGION-900.jpg?1  /><br /> Pilgrims prepare to perform a traditional dance outside the Basilica of Guadalupe on Our Lady of Guadalupe's feast day in Mexico City, Mexico. <br /> <br /> <strong>Karbala, Iraq: December 13<br /> </strong><img alt= religion  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388474/thumbs/o-RELIGION-900.jpg?1  /><br /> Iraqi Shiite Muslim pilgrims attend the Arbaeen religious festival which marks the 40th day after Ashura, commemorating the seventh century killing of Prophet Mohammed's grandson, Imam Hussein, at the Imam Hussein shrine in Karbala, 50 miles (80 kilometres) south of Baghdad.

"Russia Reaches Out To Europe's Far-Right Parties"	"VIENNA (AP) — A Russian loan to France's National Front. Invitations to Moscow for leaders of Austria's Freedom Party. Praise for Vladimir Putin from the head of Britain's anti-European Union party.<br /> <br /> As the diplomatic chill over Ukraine deepens, the Kremlin seems keener than ever to enlist Europe's far-right parties in its campaign for influence in the West, seeking new relationships based largely on shared concern over the growing clout of the EU. Russia fears that the EU and NATO could spread to countries it considers part of its sphere of influence. And it has repeatedly served notice that it will not tolerate that scenario, most recently with its Ukraine campaign.<br /> <br /> Europe's right-wing and populist parties, meanwhile, see a robust EU as contrary to their vision of Europe as a loose union of strong national states. And some regard the EU as a toady to America.<br /> <br /> The fact that many of Moscow's allies are right to far-right reflects the Kremlin's full turn. Under communism, xenophobic nationalist parties were shunned.<br /> <br /> Now they are embraced as partners who can help further Russia's interests and who share key views — advocacy of traditional family values, belief in authoritarian leadership, a distrust of the U.S. and support for strong law-and-order measures.<br /> <br /> Statements by leading critics of the EU, or euroskeptics, reflect their admiration of the Kremlin.<br /> <br /> National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen told The Associated Press this month that France and Russia  have a communality of interest.  Daughter Marine Le Pen, party president and a strong contender for the French presidency in 2017, envisions a Europe stretching  from the Atlantic to the Urals  — a  pan-European union  that includes Russia and is supported by other right-wing parties.<br /> <br /> Nationalist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban perceives prevailing winds as  blowing from the East  and sees in Russia an ideal political model for his concept of an  illiberal state.  The head of Britain's euroskeptic Independence Party, Nigel Farage, has said Putin is the world leader he most admires —  as an operator, but not as a human being. <br /> <br /> Russia offers friendship with a world power. Le Pen and other party officials visit Moscow repeatedly, and Russian guests at the party's congress this month included Andrei Isayev, a deputy speaker of the Russian parliament's lower house.<br /> <br /> Among other Moscow regulars from euroskeptic parties across Europe are members of Hungary's anti-Semitic Jobbik and Austria's Freedom Party.<br /> <br /> Jobbik parliamentarian Bela Kovacs — his detractors call him  KGBela  — is under investigation in Hungary for allegedly spying for Russia. While in Moscow recently, Freedom Party firebrand Johann Gudenus accused the European Union of kowtowing to  NATO and America  and denounced the spreading influence of the  homosexual lobby  in Europe.<br /> <br /> Shunned at home by the establishment, many on the political fringes are eager for the chance to hobnob with Russian powerbrokers, gain air time on RT television, Russia's international answer to CNN, or to act as monitors when Moscow seeks a fig leaf to legitimize elections in recently annexed Crimea.<br /> <br /> For them,  the benefit is that they can receive diplomatic support from a very high level from a superpower,  says Peter Kreko of Hungary's Political Capital research institute.<br /> <br /> Financial rewards are also incentives. Orban just signed a nuclear-reactor deal with Moscow. France is abuzz over the National Front's recent 9 million euro loan from a Russian bank owned by a reputed Putin confidant.<br /> <br /> Marine Le Pen describes it as  a perfectly legal loan that we will reimburse perfectly legally,  saying the party turned to Russia after being rejected by Western banks.  But the transaction has galvanized fears among the National Front's opponents of increased Kremlin influence, with the Socialists calling for an inquiry.<br /> <br /> Links between Russia and the right predate the Ukraine conflict. A 2005 U.S. diplomatic cable made public by Wikileaks noted close ties between Bulgaria's extreme-right Ataka party and the Russian Embassy in Sofia. And Joerg Haider, the late leader of Austria's Freedom Party, helped powerful Russian businessmen with residency permits more than a decade ago in exchange for what Austrian authorities now suspect were close to 1 million euros worth of bribes.<br /> <br /> Nor was Moscow's search for allies in Europe always restricted to anti-EU figures. Shekhovtsov sees Putin's friendships with German ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italy's former Premier Silvio Berlusconi as useful for the Kremlin before foreign policy differences that culminated in the Ukraine crisis made the Russian leader unwelcome in most European capitals.<br /> <br /> Now the diplomatic gloom is settling in, and Moscow may have few alternatives to courting Europe's EU malcontents in hopes that their strong domestic and EU election showings this year will help further its own interests.<br /> <br /> Of the 24 right-wing populist parties that took about a quarter of the European Parliament's seats in May elections, Political Capital lists 15 as  committed  to Russia.<br /> <br /> Many owe their popularity to voter perceptions that EU-friendly parties in power are to blame for the continent's economic woes — a view that could grow if the downturn persists.<br /> <br />  What Russia is saying is, 'It's fine for you to be the way you are,'  says analyst Melik Kaylan, in a study for the Institute of Modern Russia.  'You're authoritarian. We're authoritarian. Let's work together against the West.' <br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Ganley reported from Paris. Associated Press writers John-Thor Dahlburg in Brussels, Veselin Toshkov in Sofia, Bulgaria, and Pablo Gorondi in Budapest, Hungary, also contributed to this report."

"Two Israeli Burial Groups Agree To End Gender Segregation At Funerals"	"JERUSALEM (RNS) Two Jewish burial societies have agreed to not separate women from men during funerals unless the family of the deceased explicitly requests genders segregation.<br /> <br /> The agreement, reached under the auspices of the Jerusalem District Court, followed a petition filed against the burial societies, known as Chevra Kadisha in Hebrew, in the cities of Jerusalem and Rehovot.<br /> <br /> The Human Rights Clinic at Tel Aviv University’s Faculty of Law and the Jerusalem-based Israel Religious Action Center filed the petitions.<br /> <br /> Until now, the burial societies in Israel have ignored 2013 directives from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and the attorney general banning gender segregation in cemeteries.<br /> <br /> The burial societies, composed of ultra-Orthodox Jews whose strict interpretations of Jewish law prohibit most interactions between unrelated men and women, said they were following the precepts laid down by their rabbis.<br /> <br /> Under the agreement, which is pending the approval of Israel’s attorney general, electronic signs with the words “Men” and “Women” will be brought to the nation’s cemeteries but will be turned off unless a family requests a separation.<br /> <br /> Orly Erez-Likhovski, head of the Religious Action Center’s legal department, said the agreement “is part of a larger effort to ban the segregation or exclusion of women in public places, such as public buses and medical clinics.” "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 09:28:58 -0500"	"world"
"ISIS Shoots Down Iraqi Helicopter: Officials"	"BAGHDAD (AP) — Islamic State group militants shot down an Iraqi military helicopter, officials said Saturday, killing the two pilots onboard and raising fresh concerns about the extremists' ability to attack aircraft amid ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes.<br /> <br /> The attack happened late Friday in the Shiite holy city of Samarra, about 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of Baghdad. A senior Defense Ministry official told The Associated Press the Sunni militants used a shoulder-fired rocket launcher to shoot down the EC635 helicopter on the outskirts of the city. An army official corroborated the information. Both spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to speak to journalists.<br /> <br /> The EC635, built by Airbus Helicopters, is used for transportation, surveillance and combat.<br /> <br /> The militants shot down at least two other Iraqi military helicopters near the city of Beiji in October. Some fear the militants may have captured ground-to-air missiles capable of shooting down airplanes when they overran Iraqi and Syrian army bases this summer.<br /> <br /> European airlines including Virgin Atlantic, KLM and Air France, U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines and Dubai-based Emirates changed their commercial flight plans over the summer to avoid Iraqi airspace.<br /> <br /> The Islamic State group holds about a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-styled caliphate.<br /> <br /> In Syria, meanwhile, an activist group and a jihadi website said the Islamic State group's police force beheaded four men in the central province of Homs for blasphemy.<br /> <br /> The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the four were beheaded Friday in the province's east, without elaborating.<br /> <br /> A jihadi website said the  Islamic police in the state of Homs  carried out a court sentence against the four in the presences of onlookers. Grisly photos posted on the website showed each of the four blindfolded men kneeling, their hands tied behind their backs, as a masked man in a black uniform hit their necks with a cleaver.<br /> <br /> The Islamic State group governs its territory according to its radical, violent interpretation of Shariah law. It has carried out other mass killings and beheadings, often recorded and posted online.<br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Mroue reported from Beirut."	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 09:26:03 -0500"	"world"
"CIA Lied About Torture, Senate Report Suggests"	"<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — When CIA interrogators were torturing accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed at a secret prison in Poland in March 2003, a top CIA analyst asked them to show him a photograph of an alleged terrorist named Majid Khan.</p><br />               <p>The interrogators slapped Mohammed, denied him sleep, rehydrated him through his rectum, threatened to kill his children and waterboarded him 183 times. And he offered up details on Khan.</p><br />               <p>The analyst later told the CIA's inspector general that Mohammed's information helped lead to Khan's arrest, CIA records show. The watchdog included that as a success story in a 2004 report that became public and for many years stood as the most detailed accounting of the program.</p><br />               <p>But the analyst, then deputy chief of the CIA's Osama bin Laden unit, knew Khan already had been captured in Pakistan at the time Mohammed was asked about him, according to the 520-page Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA interrogations that was released this past week.</p><br />               <p>In other words, what she told the inspector general wasn't true.</p><br />               <p>The Senate report has exposed years of such CIA misrepresentations that seem designed to boost the case for the effectiveness of brutal interrogations. The CIA acknowledges the misrepresentation about Khan's arrest, while disputing most and playing down others.</p><br />               <p>But the Senate investigation relied on the CIA's own records to document a pattern of an agency consistently understating the brutality of the techniques used on detainees and overstating the value of the information they produced.</p><br />               <p> You've decided to do something and now you've got to justify it, and you may even believe your justifications,  said Cynthia Storer, a former CIA analyst whose work has been credited with helping locate bin Laden, and who opposed the torture.</p><br />               <p> The CIA lied,  Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, one of the agency's toughest critics, said in the Senate a few days ago.</p><br />               <p>In its written response to the report, the CIA said it was  dismayed  that it had  failed to meet its own standards for precision of language, and we acknowledge that this was unacceptable.  But, the agency said,  Even in those cases, we found that the actual impact of the information acquired from interrogations was significant and still supported. </p><br />               <p>CIA officials insist that the treatment of Mohammed and other detainees yielded valuable intelligence, something the Senate report disputes. The CIA stands by 18 of the 20 cases in which the Senate says the agency failed to obtain uniquely valuable intelligence from detainees through harsh interrogation.</p><br />               <p>The Senate report has exposed lies well beyond its pages.</p><br />               <p>Former top CIA manager Jose Rodriguez wrote in his 2011 memoir,  Hard Measures,  that during waterboarding,  our officers used far less water for far shorter periods of time than they were allowed. </p><br />               <p>He suggested that the public's view had been swayed by  a cartoon version  in which detainees are  practically being doused by a fire hose. </p><br />               <p>CIA records cited in the report show that Rodriguez, who destroyed videotapes of some of the sessions, was not telling the truth.</p><br />               <p>The waterboarding was far more intense and gruesome than the Justice Department had authorized, according to the records, which the CIA has not disputed.</p><br />               <p>Waterboarding caused al-Qaida operative Abu Zubaydah to become  completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth,  while the procedure used on Mohammad evolved into a  series of near drownings,  with interrogators cupping a pool of water over his nose and mouth. The first waterboarding session of Mohamed lasted 10 minutes longer than the Justice Department allowed, the Senate report says.</p><br />               <p>Rodriguez, who ran the CIA interrogation program, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><br />               <p>CIA officials said they could not speak for Rodriguez, but they say the analyst's assertion about Khan's arrest was a one-time mistake.</p><br />               <p>Senate investigators say the error was repeated many times to the inspector general and was used to bolster the case for Justice Department approval of brutal techniques. The misinformation was also sent to a CIA panel reviewing the interrogation program.</p><br />               <p>The same analyst, who now holds a senior job in the CIA's Counter Terrorism Center, exaggerated other aspects of intelligence gained under torture to the inspector general, the report says. She played a pivotal role in the wrongful CIA kidnapping of German citizen Khaled el-Masri, who says he was tortured at the CIA's Salt Pit in Afghanistan.</p><br />               <p>Another CIA misrepresentation, the Senate report says, was the assertion to the White House, the Justice Department, Congress, and later the public that Zubaydah, the first detainee to be waterboarded, told the CIA he believed the U.S. was weak and lacked resilience, and that he stopped cooperating under traditional interrogation techniques.</p><br />               <p>In August 2006, a CIA al-Qaida expert wrote:  We have no records that 'he declared that America was weak, and lacking in resilience' ...   Another al-Qaida expert wrote,  I can find no reference to AZ being deifant (sic) and declaring America weak... in fact everything I have read indicated he used a non deifiant (sic) resistance strategy. </p><br />               <p>Two others speculated how the exaggeration took hold. They refer to the senior analyst who gave the misinformation to the inspector general.</p><br />               <p> Yes, believe so,  an officer wrote.  And agree, we shall pass over in silence. </p><br />               <p>Years of such misinformation bubbled to the surface during the first briefing about interrogations to the full Senate Intelligence Committee, in 2007, by then-CIA Director Michael Hayden. He made so many factual misstatements about the program, the techniques, the number of detainees and the intelligence, that the Senate study devotes a 37-page appendix to fact-checking his testimony.</p><br />               <p> I was describing the mature program that I was suggesting should go forward,  Hayden said in an email this past week.  I think a lot of the incidents they pointed out came from really early in the interrogation process. </p><br />               <p>___</p><br />               <p>Follow Ken Dilanian on Twitter at https://twitter.com/KenDilanianAP</p> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 09:09:05 -0500"	"world"

Ahead, a brief guide to all the superhero news you already knew about before the Sony Pictures hack:<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Spider-Man could have joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong></big><br /> While Spider-Man and Captain America are both part of the Marvel Comics universe, they exist in different realms onscreen. Spider-Man is a Sony property; Captain America and his fellow Avengers belong to Disney. But according to emails sent on Oct. 13 and published by The Daily Beast, <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/14/exclusive-sony-emails-reveal-destiny-s-child-and-kanye-west-movies-and-spidey-cameo-in-capt-3.html  target= _hplink >Sony and Disney discussed putting Spider-Man in  Captain America: Civil War. </a> One week before those notes were sent, however, on Oct. 6, <a href= http://www.hitfix.com/motion-captured/marvels-making-big-plans-beyond-avengers-3-and-its-making-hollywood-crazy  target= _hplink >HitFix writer Drew McWeeny alluded to the same thing</a>:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>While I can't get the confirmations I need to verify the story, I'm hearing that there are some very cool  Spider-Man  plans being discussed that would help Sony refocus their enormously important franchise while also opening up some connections in the onscreen Marvel movie universe that would blow fandom's minds. Will it work out? I don't know. I would love to be able to state for sure that it's happening. What seems clear from what I've heard is that Marvel wants to be able to play with all of their characters, and if they can make that work creatively and on a corporate level, they will, and that means the world gets bigger again.</blockquote><br /> <br /> On Oct. 7, one day after McWeeny's report published, Entertainment Weekly's Anthony Breznican revealed that  delicate preliminary conversations  <a href= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/10/07/spider-man-marvel-sony/  target= _hplink >were underway between Sony and Disney regarding Spider-Man</a>.<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Sony could reboot Spider-Man again</strong></big><br /> Following the disappointing box-office returns for  The Amazing Spider-Man 2,  <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/05/18/we-need-to-talk-about-spider-man/  target= _hplink >there was much discussion online about the future of Spider-Man</a>. The same thing happened inside Sony: As reported by The Daily Beast, <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/13/exclusive-sony-hack-reveals-studio-planning-another-spider-man-reboot.html  target= _hplink >Sony executives, in emails dated Nov. 13, had conversations about rebooting the Spider-Man franchise</a> for a third time. Three months earlier, on Aug. 4, <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/08/female-superhero-movie-spider-man-sony-810253/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com reported that similar discussions had occurred</a>. On Oct. 7, in a post that provided a rundown of various Spider-Man rumors, <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/07/rumor-spider-man-to-cross-over-with-the-avengers/  target= _hplink >Badass Digest editor Devin Faraci reported that one of Sony's options was to  soft reboot  Spider-Man within the studio's  Sinister Six  film</a>. That movie would have  a new actor playing a Spidey who works with the villains. <br /> <br /> <big><strong>There could be an all-female Spider-Man movie</strong></big><br /> A Sept. 20 email exchange <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/14/exclusive-sony-emails-reveal-destiny-s-child-and-kanye-west-movies-and-spidey-cameo-in-capt-3.html  target= _hplink >discussed a female superhero movie within the Spider-Man world</a> and the possibility of building a shared universe on par with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/08/female-superhero-movie-spider-man-sony-810253/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com also reported</a> on that news in August:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>Having pushed the next installment of its Spider-Man franchise out of 2016 and into 2018, Sony Pictures is doing a top-to-bottom revamp of its most important property, insiders say. And that includes a female superhero movie which is being eyed for a 2017 release date, Deadline has learned.</blockquote><br /> <br /> On Oct. 30, Faraci wrote that the potential project, called  Glass Ceiling,  <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/30/what-is-glass-ceiling-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-the-spider-man-movie/  target= _hplink >would bring together female characters in the Spider-Man world</a>.<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Joss Whedon might not direct  Marvel's The Avengers: Infinity War </strong></big><br /> While not part of Sony, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was discussed in emails too. One correspondence apparently revealed that  Captain America: Civil War  directors Anthony and Joe Russo <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/13/exclusive-sony-hack-reveals-studio-planning-another-spider-man-reboot.html  target= _hplink >would likely take over for Joss Whedon</a> on the third  Avengers  film,  Infinity War,  which will get split into two parts. That was known before as well: <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/13/robert-downey-jr-bringing-civil-war-to-captain-america-3/  target= _hplink >Faraci reported the Russos rumor in October</a>. In a November post about Daniel Bruhl joining  Captain America: Civl War,  <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/11/daniel-bruhl-captain-america-robert-downey-jr-chris-evans-1201284648/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com confirmed the speculation was real</a>:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>The Russos are building up their Marvel cred with this all-star outing, and I keep hearing they will step up to the ultimate Marvel all-star team and take the reins of The Avengers franchise from Joss Whedon, possibly with that next film that will shoot back to back.</blockquote> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 13:15:21 -0500"	"arts"

"Why Were So Many Beloved Christmas Songs Written By Jewish Musicians?"	"(RNS) Christians don’t seem to mind that so many beloved Christmas songs were written by Jews, and Jews tend to reel off the list with pride.<br /> <br /> White Christmas. Let It Snow. Santa Baby. I’ll Be Home for Christmas. Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire. Silver Bells. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.<br /> <br /> Those not mentioned here could fill an album.<br /> <br /> But why didn’t the Jews write any similarly iconic songs for their holiday that falls around Christmastime: Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights?<br /> <br /> “I Have a Little Dreidl”?  Great song … if you’re 4.<br /> <br /> There are reasons that Jews are good at Christmas songs and why so many of these songs became so popular. And there are reasons why Jews didn’t write similarly catchy tunes for Hanukkah — or any other Jewish holiday.<br /> <br /> But first, a little music history.<br /> <br /> In the first half of the 20th century, Jews flocked to the music industry. It was one business where they didn’t face overwhelming anti-Semitism, said Michael Feinstein, the Emmy Award-winning interpreter of American musical standards.<br /> <br /> “White Christmas,” written by Jewish lyricist Irving Berlin, topped the charts in 1942 and launched popular Christmas music, encouraging many others — Jews and non-Jews — to write more odes to the holiday.<br /> <br /> And although celebrating the birth of Christ was not something these Jewish songwriters would want to do, they could feel comfortable composing more secular Christmas singles.<br /> <br /> “The Christmas songs that are popular are not about Jesus, but they’re about sleigh bells and Santa and the trappings of Christmas,” Feinstein said. “They’re not religious songs.”<br /> <br /> In their music and lyrics, Jews captured Christmas not only as a wonderful, wintry time for family gatherings, but also as an American holiday. What they drew on, said Rabbi Kenneth Kanter, an expert on Jews and popular culture at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, was their background as the children of European-born Jews, or as immigrants themselves, in the case of Russian-born Berlin and others.<br /> <br /> Jewish songwriters’ own successful assimilation and gratitude to America pervades their midcentury Christmas and other songs, and appealed to a country that wanted to feel brave and united as it fought World War II.<br /> <br /> “These songs made Christmas a kind of national celebration, almost a patriotic celebration,” Kanter said.<br /> <br /> The irreligious nature of these Christmas songs may not sit well with pious Christians, said Feinstein, who is Jewish and who cut “A Michael Feinstein Christmas,” among many other albums. But they are now part of the fabric of our larger culture, he said, and “any singer who is a singer of the American songbook will sing Christmas songs,” said Feinstein. “We all sing them.”<br /> <br /> Feinstein is in good Jewish company. Barbra Streisand made “A Christmas Album.” Neil Diamond cut not only “A Christmas Album,” but also “A Christmas Album, Volume II,” and then a “Cherry, Cherry Christmas.” This year, Idina Menzel, who started out singing at bar mitzvahs and is best-known as the strong, melodic voice in the hit movie “Frozen,” just came out with the very Christmas-y “Holiday Wishes.” This list is far from exhaustive.<br /> <br /> And how about Hanukkah songs?<br /> <br /> First, singers want an audience, and with Jews making up less than 2 percent of the U.S. population, and Christians nearly 80 percent, the natural market for Hanukkah tunes is relatively tiny. Though the story of Hanukkah is about religious freedom, a theme Americans can relate to, few know the tale of the ancient Maccabees — how they threw off their Hellenistic oppressors, and the drop of oil which miraculously lit their lamp for eight days.<br /> <br /> Feinstein, who was raised in a Conservative synagogue in Columbus, Ohio, said many people have tried to get him to lend his voice to a Hanukkah song, but he’s just not that interested.<br /> <br /> “They usually are in a minor key,” he said. “And there isn’t as much imagery that one can put into a Hanukkah song compared to Christmas.”<br /> <br /> There are still plenty of tuneful and moving Hanukkah songs, some of them in major keys — the rousing “Al Hanisim,” for example. But many are written in languages other than English — Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino — and aren’t going to get much airplay in the U.S.<br /> <br /> But a growing body of Hanukkah music aims to break through the subdued and somber stereotype.<br /> <br /> In 1982, for example, the folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary first performed “Light One Candle,” a social action song that invokes the Maccabees’ struggle.<br /> <br /> The Jewish reggae star Matisyahu came out with “Miracle” in 2011. And the Maccabeats, an a capella group based at Yeshiva University, remade the pop song “Dynamite” into a 2010 Hanukkah hit called “Candlelight.”<br /> <br /> And then there’s Kenny Ellis, the cantor at Temple Beth Ami in Santa Clarita, Calif., who is on a mission to convince Jews and non-Jews alike that Hanukkah songs can be a zippy part of the national songbook. Each Hanukkah, Ellis sings from his 2005 album, “Hanukkah Swings,” a big-band take on some of the most well-known Hanukkah songs, starting with “Swingin’ Dreidel.”<br /> <br /> To Ellis’ delight, Feinstein once sang “Swingin’ Dreidel” in his New York nightclub. It wouldn’t hurt if more Jewish singers tried a Hanukkah song or two, Ellis said. Maybe a whole album.<br /> <br /> “I love all the Jewish performers that do Christmas albums,” Ellis said. “But what’s the big deal about doing a Hanukkah album? Does anyone think that if Barbra Streisand did a Hanukkah album, that her career would be finished?” "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 08:05:34 -0500"	"arts"

"Auburn Freshman Football Player Jakell Mitchell Shot And Killed"	"AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn freshman football player Jakell Lenard Mitchell was shot and killed Sunday morning at an apartment complex near the Auburn University campus, police and news reports said.<br /> <br /> Auburn Police Capt. Will Matthews told The Associated Press that police responded at 12:25 a.m. Sunday to a shots fired call the Tiger Lodge apartment complex, where the 18-year-old Mitchell was found. Mitchell was later pronounced dead at a hospital.<br /> <br /> Matthews said an investigation is ongoing and no suspects have been taken into custody. No further details were released.<br /> <br /> Mitchell redshirted this season for the Auburn Tigers out of nearby Opelika High School. He was expected to contend for a starting spot next season as a back and tight end.<br /> <br /> Mitchell missed his senior season at Opelika as he recovered from an ACL injury. He rushed for 392 yards and 17 touchdowns in 2013 as a junior.<br /> <br /> Sunday's shooting happened at the same apartment complex Desmonte Leonard killed three men at a party in the summer of 2012. The complex, located a few miles from campus, is popular with students and its name was changed following the 2012 shooting.<br /> <br /> Jurors convicted Leonard of capital murder in the shooting deaths of former Auburn football players Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips along with DeMario Pitts. Three other people were wounded.<br /> <br /> Leonard's attorney said the shooting stemmed from a fight and that Leonard fired in self-defense. Prosecutors argued that Leonard aimed at the victims and wasn't involved in the initial fight.<br /> <br /> Leonard will be sentenced on Jan. 20. The jury recommended life without parole, but the judge could still sentence him to death. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 10:27:27 -0500"	"sports"
"Here's How Birds Make Do Without External Ears"	"Birds have the incredible ability to hear different sounds even though they don't have outer ears like mammals do. <br /> <br /> In fact, birds can perceive whether the source of a sound is above them, below them, or at the same level. But how do they do it?<br /> <br /> It's not magic. According to a new study conducted by researchers at Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM) in Germany, birds localize sound by using their entire heads like giant outer ears.<br /> <br /> For the study, the researchers examined the eardrums of crows, ducks and chickens, measuring the volume of sounds that hit the birds' eardrums at different angles. The researchers noticed that sounds <a href= http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/scientists-discover-how-birds-localize-sound-sources-1.2870146  target= _hplink >hit the eardrums on the left and right side of the bird's head at different frequencies</a>, and these frequencies varied depending on the direction that sound was coming from.<br /> <br /> This suggests that the <a href= http://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/short/article/32029/  target= _hplink >bird's brain processes the difference in frequency</a> between the ears to determine where that sound originated in relation to the bird's eye level, the researchers say.<br /> <br /> Similarly, a <a href= http://www.indiana.edu/~emusic/acoustics/ear.htm  target= _hplink >mammal's outer ear</a> is responsible, in part, for helping to place the location of a sound, by funneling and focusing sound frequencies as the sound travels to the middle ear and auditory canal.<br /> <br /> <strong>(Story continues below.)</strong><br /> <img alt= birds ears  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385456/thumbs/o-BIRDS-EARS-570.jpg?4  /><br /> <em>Lateral eyed birds like blackbirds, ducks or crows can discern the height of lateral sounds very precisely to the sound volumes. Frontal eyed birds like the barn owl have specific hearing capacities for frontal sounds. </em><br /> <br /> “This is <a href= http://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/short/article/32029/  target= _hplink >how birds identify where exactly a lateral sound is coming from</a> -- for example at eye height,” the study's lead author Hans A.

Thousands of people of all races and religions came together to protest police brutality, the lack of indictment of the police officers involved in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, and the systematic racism in the criminal justice system. <br /> <br /> Organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton, the peaceful rally included prayers at the opening rally in Freedom Plaza near the White House; and prayer again at the closing rally where Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson offered a prophetic prayer for justice that opened by petitioning 'Mother/Father God' and ended with thousands of people holding hands and responding with a resounding 'Amen.'  <br /> <br /> Throughout the diverse crowd, people from different religious traditions showed how their faith inspired their call for justice.

"Why Were So Many Beloved Christmas Songs Written By Jewish Musicians?"	"(RNS) Christians don’t seem to mind that so many beloved Christmas songs were written by Jews, and Jews tend to reel off the list with pride.<br /> <br /> White Christmas. Let It Snow. Santa Baby. I’ll Be Home for Christmas. Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire. Silver Bells. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.<br /> <br /> Those not mentioned here could fill an album.<br /> <br /> But why didn’t the Jews write any similarly iconic songs for their holiday that falls around Christmastime: Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights?<br /> <br /> “I Have a Little Dreidl”?  Great song … if you’re 4.<br /> <br /> There are reasons that Jews are good at Christmas songs and why so many of these songs became so popular. And there are reasons why Jews didn’t write similarly catchy tunes for Hanukkah — or any other Jewish holiday.<br /> <br /> But first, a little music history.<br /> <br /> In the first half of the 20th century, Jews flocked to the music industry. It was one business where they didn’t face overwhelming anti-Semitism, said Michael Feinstein, the Emmy Award-winning interpreter of American musical standards.<br /> <br /> “White Christmas,” written by Jewish lyricist Irving Berlin, topped the charts in 1942 and launched popular Christmas music, encouraging many others — Jews and non-Jews — to write more odes to the holiday.<br /> <br /> And although celebrating the birth of Christ was not something these Jewish songwriters would want to do, they could feel comfortable composing more secular Christmas singles.<br /> <br /> “The Christmas songs that are popular are not about Jesus, but they’re about sleigh bells and Santa and the trappings of Christmas,” Feinstein said. “They’re not religious songs.”<br /> <br /> In their music and lyrics, Jews captured Christmas not only as a wonderful, wintry time for family gatherings, but also as an American holiday. What they drew on, said Rabbi Kenneth Kanter, an expert on Jews and popular culture at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, was their background as the children of European-born Jews, or as immigrants themselves, in the case of Russian-born Berlin and others.<br /> <br /> Jewish songwriters’ own successful assimilation and gratitude to America pervades their midcentury Christmas and other songs, and appealed to a country that wanted to feel brave and united as it fought World War II.<br /> <br /> “These songs made Christmas a kind of national celebration, almost a patriotic celebration,” Kanter said.<br /> <br /> The irreligious nature of these Christmas songs may not sit well with pious Christians, said Feinstein, who is Jewish and who cut “A Michael Feinstein Christmas,” among many other albums. But they are now part of the fabric of our larger culture, he said, and “any singer who is a singer of the American songbook will sing Christmas songs,” said Feinstein. “We all sing them.”<br /> <br /> Feinstein is in good Jewish company. Barbra Streisand made “A Christmas Album.” Neil Diamond cut not only “A Christmas Album,” but also “A Christmas Album, Volume II,” and then a “Cherry, Cherry Christmas.” This year, Idina Menzel, who started out singing at bar mitzvahs and is best-known as the strong, melodic voice in the hit movie “Frozen,” just came out with the very Christmas-y “Holiday Wishes.” This list is far from exhaustive.<br /> <br /> And how about Hanukkah songs?<br /> <br /> First, singers want an audience, and with Jews making up less than 2 percent of the U.S. population, and Christians nearly 80 percent, the natural market for Hanukkah tunes is relatively tiny. Though the story of Hanukkah is about religious freedom, a theme Americans can relate to, few know the tale of the ancient Maccabees — how they threw off their Hellenistic oppressors, and the drop of oil which miraculously lit their lamp for eight days.<br /> <br /> Feinstein, who was raised in a Conservative synagogue in Columbus, Ohio, said many people have tried to get him to lend his voice to a Hanukkah song, but he’s just not that interested.<br /> <br /> “They usually are in a minor key,” he said. “And there isn’t as much imagery that one can put into a Hanukkah song compared to Christmas.”<br /> <br /> There are still plenty of tuneful and moving Hanukkah songs, some of them in major keys — the rousing “Al Hanisim,” for example. But many are written in languages other than English — Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino — and aren’t going to get much airplay in the U.S.<br /> <br /> But a growing body of Hanukkah music aims to break through the subdued and somber stereotype.<br /> <br /> In 1982, for example, the folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary first performed “Light One Candle,” a social action song that invokes the Maccabees’ struggle.<br /> <br /> The Jewish reggae star Matisyahu came out with “Miracle” in 2011. And the Maccabeats, an a capella group based at Yeshiva University, remade the pop song “Dynamite” into a 2010 Hanukkah hit called “Candlelight.”<br /> <br /> And then there’s Kenny Ellis, the cantor at Temple Beth Ami in Santa Clarita, Calif., who is on a mission to convince Jews and non-Jews alike that Hanukkah songs can be a zippy part of the national songbook. Each Hanukkah, Ellis sings from his 2005 album, “Hanukkah Swings,” a big-band take on some of the most well-known Hanukkah songs, starting with “Swingin’ Dreidel.”<br /> <br /> To Ellis’ delight, Feinstein once sang “Swingin’ Dreidel” in his New York nightclub. It wouldn’t hurt if more Jewish singers tried a Hanukkah song or two, Ellis said. Maybe a whole album.<br /> <br /> “I love all the Jewish performers that do Christmas albums,” Ellis said. “But what’s the big deal about doing a Hanukkah album? Does anyone think that if Barbra Streisand did a Hanukkah album, that her career would be finished?” "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 08:05:34 -0500"	"religion"
"Sri Lanka's Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith Says Candidates Pledge No Violence As Pope Visit Approaches"	"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — The two main candidates in Sri Lanka's presidential election have promised a violence-free vote, with Pope Francis scheduled to visit the country just days later, a church leader said.<br /> <br /> Francis is to begin a three-day visit on Jan. 13, five days after the poll. Some church officials are seeking a postponement, fearing there could be post-election violence because of the acrimonious campaign. President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is seeking a third term in office, is facing his former health minister, Maithripala Sirisena.  Sirisena defected from Rajapaksa's government after the election was announced last month.<br /> <br /> Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said the bishops' conference met with both candidates and received their assurances of no violence, the Catholic weekly newspaper Messenger reported on its website.<br /> <br />  We need to have faith and believe in what they both told us,  Ranjith was quoted as saying.   In fact there were a lot of cross questions posed by the bishops and both candidates said that whatever their status is after the elections, either as the winner or as the loser, they will both welcome the holy father when he steps down at the airport. <br /> <br /> About 70 percent of Sri Lanka's 20 million people, including both main candidates, are Buddhist.

"Catholic Church In Australia: 'Obligatory Celibacy May Have Contributed To Abuse'"	"VATICAN CITY (RNS) The Roman Catholic Church in Australia acknowledged that “obligatory celibacy” may have contributed to decades of clerical sexual abuse of children in what may be the first such admission by church officials around the world.<br /> <br /> A church advisory group called the Truth, Justice and Healing Council made the startling admission Friday (Dec. 12) in a report to the government’s Royal Commission, which is examining thousands of cases of abuse in Australia.<br /> <br /> The 44-page report by the council attacked church culture and the impact of what it called “obedience and closed environments” in some religious orders and institutions.<br /> <br /> “Church institutions and their leaders, over many decades, seemed to turn a blind eye, either instinctively or deliberately, to the abuse happening within their diocese or religious order, protecting the institution rather than caring for the child,” the report said.<br /> <br /> “Obedience and closed environments also seem to have had a role in the prevalence of abuse within some religious orders and dioceses.  Obligatory celibacy may also have contributed to abuse.”<br /> <br /> The council’s CEO, Francis Sullivan, who has held various administrative roles in the health sector, including heading Catholic Health Australia, said clergy training should include “psychosexual development.”<br /> <br /> “It’s a no-brainer,” Sullivan said. “You need to address how sexuality is understood and acted out by members of the clergy.”<br /> <br /> But the Chicago-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, which represents around 20,000 victims worldwide, said the latest report did little to help protect those at risk from abuse.<br /> <br /> “Decisive action is needed, not more reports,” SNAP national director David Clohessy said. “The church hierarchy knows what’s needed. It simply refuses to give up its power and enable secular authorities to investigate and prosecute those who commit and conceal sexual violence against the vulnerable.”<br /> <br /> The Vatican’s chief spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, could not be reached for comment Friday. But Maltese Bishop Charles Scicluna, the Vatican’s former chief prosecutor for abuse cases, tried to put the report in context in remarks to the Italian daily La Stampa.<br /> <br /> “You mustn’t forget that most abuse occurs in the family,” he said. “Obviously I don’t exclude individual cases where celibacy is lived badly that may have psychological consequences. But it should be said clearly that it is certainly not the origin of this sad and very painful phenomenon and remember that there is no nexus between cause and effect.”<br /> <br /> The suggestion of a link between celibacy and child sexual abuse has divided Australian Catholic leaders in the past.<br /> <br /> Cardinal George Pell, former archbishop of Sydney and now head of the Vatican’s powerful economic ministry, acknowledged there may be a connection when he testified before a separate government inquiry in Australia last year. He was unavailable for comment at the Vatican Friday.<br /> <br /> The independent Australian council is made up of church and lay members and is supervised by some of the nation’s senior archbishops, though its views do not necessarily reflect those of all senior clergy.

"12 Secrets From The Pros To Run Your Best Race"	"<em>By Jordan Shakeshaft for<a href= http://dailyburn.com/life/?partner=huff&mtype=5&sub_id=12112014_personalbest&utm_source=huff&utm_medium=huff&utm_campaign=12112014_personalbest&utm_content=12112014_personalbest  target= _hplink > Life by DailyBurn</a></em><br /> <br /> For Meb Keflezighi it happened at mile 15 of the 2014 Boston Marathon, when he surged ahead of the pack and stayed there for the next 11 miles, crossing the storied finish line 12 seconds ahead of Kenya's Wilson Chebet. Prior to Boston, the fastest Keflezighi had run the 26.2 miles was at the 2012 Olympic trials, finishing in 2:09:08. At age 38, one month shy of his 39th birthday, and one year after the tragic bombings on Boylston Street, Meb ran the most important race of his life, in 2:08:37.<br /> <br /> For Deena Kastor it happened somewhere along the River Thames, retracing the route that earned her an American record three years prior. This time, at the 2006 London Marathon, she had two even loftier goals: Run it in under two hours and 20 minutes, and win the race. Not only did she accomplish both, she was the first woman to break 2:20:00 with a 2:19:36 finish that smashed her previous American record by nearly two minutes. At the end of the year, Kastor was ranked #1 in the world.<br /> <br /> <img alt= meb keflezighi  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2375858/thumbs/o-MEB-KEFLEZIGHI-570.jpg?5  /><br /> <br /> <strong>A Winning Approach</strong><br /> Personal bests, personal records (PRs), the best days ever... Whatever you call them, the good news is they're not just reserved for the elites. What each one has in common: That moment when the training, the execution -- and sometimes a touch of magic -- all come together to reward you at the finish line.<br /> <br /> So how is a PR goal set, tackled, and, if all goes according to plan, accomplished?  Getting the best out of ourselves takes sacrifice and commitment, no question ... You have to dare to do something different, something memorable,  says Keflezighi, who paced runners of all levels to break 1:45 in the Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Half-Marathon in November.<br /> <br /> Whether your goal is to qualify for Boston or to finish your first 5K in under 30 minutes, these tips from Keflezighi (Olympic silver medalist, reigning Boston Marathon champion, and American record holder) and Kastor (Olympic bronze medalist and 12-time American record holder) will help make your PR aspirations a reality. Of course, it's up to you (and a willing training partner or two) to put in the work!<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Set Multiple Goals</strong><br /> While it's natural to want to go after that one big, all-or-nothing goal, it's important to anticipate circumstances out of your control.  You should always have an A, B and C goal,  Keflezighi recommends. During the 2014 New York City Marathon, he says his objectives were A) to run a personal best, B) to win and C) to make the podium. Though the heavy winds put a wrench in plan A, there were still two other goals to chase down.  You have to think positive,  says Keflezighi.  I was in 8th place with three or four miles to go, and I ended up just one place shy of the medal, so you have to be proud of that. <br /> <br /> <strong>2. Plan Your Attack</strong><br /> If you're serious about PRing, you'll need a serious training plan to match.  I think having a coach, believing in a program, and committing to follow it allows you to consistently build the athlete within,  Kastor says. Though a good pro won't come cheap, even just one or two online consultations can be a great starting point to assess where you're at and how to start building out your next eight to 16 weeks of workouts. Don't have the budget to invest in coaching? Runner's World offers digital training plans for just about every distance and ability level (starting at $20), and apps like RunKeeper and Nike+ Running provide some for free.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Vary Your Workouts</strong><br />  People often say, 'Oh, I'm a marathoner -- I'm just going to go the same pace,'  says Keflezighi,  but there are so many other things you can do to help you improve [come] race day.  When it feels as though your training is about to plateau, shake things up a bit.  Shorten your speedwork and get more aggressive, or find a new trail to explore,  Kastor suggests.<br /> <br /> New to intervals? It can be as simple as  One minute hard, three minutes easy, two minutes hard, five minutes easy,  says Keflezighi,  Or run a block; jog a block. It's all about changing mechanics. <br /> <br /> <img alt= deena kastor  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2375880/thumbs/o-DEENA-KASTOR-570.jpg?1  /><br /> <br /> <strong>4. Feed The Machine</strong><br /> Don't underestimate nutrition -- it's one of the greatest assets a runner has, Kastor says.  Even for general health, it is important to eat a large amount of high-quality food. I always choose organic, fresh, grass-fed, whole-grain foods.  If you're tacking on more miles, she suggests having plenty of healthy snacks around, too, so you don't turn to junk food when runger strikes.  I love keeping roasted nuts, fresh fruit and homemade kale or spinach chips on the counter for me and my family,  the ASICS Marathoner says.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Change Terrain</strong><br /> It's no surprise that more mileage can mean an increased risk of injury. (Reminder: Injured runners won't make it to the start line, let alone PR). One way to minimize the impact? Seek out softer ground, like dirt or grass, to give your body a break from the pounding.  I recommend doing at least half your runs on soft surfaces, and the other half on pavement, just to get used to it,  Keflezighi says. Bonus: Venturing onto new land will help develop underutilized muscles, which can in turn increase power, he adds.<br /> <br /> <strong>6. Cross-Train (With Care)</strong><br /> Meb credits staying strong and injury-free to cross-training, which can include up to four hour-long workouts a week on the low-impact ElliptiGO. Aquajogging, swimming and biking can be great options too, he says. As for strength work:  Even if it's just five to 10 minutes a day, it can sometimes be more beneficial to do that than squeezing in that extra mile,  says Keflezighi, who sticks to mostly bodyweight training.<br /> <br /> And while there's a big movement towards strength training, don't expect to find Kastor at a bootcamp or CrossFit box anytime soon.  I don't believe in cross-training to help running. I believe running makes you better at running.  You can, however, find Kastor, along with her ASICS Mammoth Track Club teammates, at the gym for about 40 minutes of dynamic movement a day.  Leg swings, walking lunges, step-ups and prone eagles all help to increase mobility so we can run freely. <br /> <br /> <strong>7. Get More Sleep</strong><br /> While runners need to run, they also need to rest.  I don't believe in overtraining, but I believe many people can become under-rested,  Kastor says.  If you are adding mileage to your program, make sure you also add some recovery time, like going to bed 30 minutes earlier. Mileage is important, but so is rest.  During sleep, since muscles remain relaxed, the body is best able to repair broken-down tissue. Those extra Zzs will help keep your legs -- and your mind -- fresh for the challenges ahead.<br /> <br /> <strong>8. Know Your Gear</strong><br /> Over the course of your training, you'll have no doubt bought-out your local running store, trying various GUs, gadgets and gear. But as race day nears, you'll want to settle on your go-to's. For Kastor, that's the ASICS GEL-Hyper Speed racing flats and a hat.  It keeps the elements off my face so my facial muscles can stay relaxed. Whether its sunny, windy or rainy I find a cap protects and acts as blinders [in order to focus on] the road ahead.  Learn what works for you, and never (never!) try anything new on race day -- especially shoes!<br /> <br /> <img alt= deena kastor finish line  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2375884/thumbs/o-DEENA-KASTOR-FINISH-LINE-570.jpg?3  /><br /> <br /> <strong>9. Retrace Your Steps</strong><br /> In the weeks leading up to the big day, some combination of excitement and nerves is inevitable. Instead of letting your emotions get the better of you, take a few moments to quiet your mind and think back on your journey.  I always look at my training log and reflect on some of the longer, tougher and fastest workouts I accomplished leading up to race day,  says Kastor, who writes regularly in her Believe Training Journal.<br /> <br /> Be sure to also look ahead, Keflezighi adds.  You know it's going to be challenging; you know it's doing to be difficult. But you have to think about why you started doing it, and all the sacrifices you've made along the way ... waking up early to put in 28 miles, 27 miles, 26 miles. You made it all this way -- you have to be ready to maximize it. <br /> <br /> <strong>10. Live The Moment</strong><br />  My best races are the ones where I take it all in; not just my training, but the history, scenery and the crowds,  Kastor says.  The [London] course was a stunning tour of an enchanting city, so rich in history that I wanted to enjoy tea sandwiches and crumpets with the queen afterwards.  During the race, don't be afraid to take a break from checking your splits to soak in your surroundings.<br /> <br />  Road racing is not like other sports -- to be so close to other runners, and right next to the crowds,  Keflezighi says.  Just one person can have a positive impact by pushing the pace, or giving a thumbs up, or acknowledging that you're there. Being able to interact with the crowd is the real beauty of road racing.  Let the energy fuel you -- you might just avoid hitting a wall in the final stretch ahead.<br /> <br /> <strong>11. Run With Patience</strong><br /> PRs don't just hinge on speed, they require patience -- especially at the beginning, Keflezighi says.  Don't get too excited and put everything into the first 10 miles of the half-marathon, or the first 17 to 18 miles of a marathon. If you can negative split, or try to stay even, then you have a better chance of a faster finish.  Determine your race pace before the gun goes off, and avoid letting those inevitable jitters re-jigger your plan.<br /> <br /> <strong>12. Run To Win</strong><br /> If you don't believe in yourself, then who else will?  I always say, 'run to win.' You get first place by seizing the moment and trying to get the best out of yourself,  says Keflezighi. No matter what the course has in store for you, lay it all out there and have some fun in the process.  Get to that finish line as strong as you can but also with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> <img alt= meb keflezighi  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2375874/thumbs/o-MEB-KEFLEZIGHI-570.jpg?1  /><br /> <br /> <strong>More from Life by DailyBurn:</strong> <br /> <a href= http://dailyburn.com/life/fitness/best-half-marathons/?partner=huff&mtype=5&sub_id=12112014_personalbest&utm_source=huff&utm_medium=huff&utm_campaign=12112014_personalbest&utm_content=12112014_personalbest  target= _hplink >The 50 Best Half-Marathons in the U.S.</a><br /> <a href= http://dailyburn.com/life/fitness/treadmill-classes-cardio-workouts/?partner=huff&mtype=5&sub_id=12112014_personalbest&utm_source=huff&utm_medium=huff&utm_campaign=12112014_personalbest&utm_content=12112014_personalbest  target= _hplink >8 Killer Treadmill Classes (Plus Cardio Workouts to Try Now!)</a><br /> <a href= http://dailyburn.com/life/fitness/worst-people-gym-etiquette/?partner=huff&mtype=5&sub_id=12112014_personalbest&utm_source=huff&utm_medium=huff&utm_campaign=12112014_personalbest&utm_content=12112014_personalbest  target= _hplink >The 20 Worst People at the Gym, According to Trainers</a> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 09:39:30 -0500"	"healthy"

At least that's what I tell myself. Actually, though, there are some simple ways to make being a slug just a little healthier. And not one involves a workout.<br /> <br /> <strong>Have some wine with that.</strong><br /> You know that alcohol in moderation can protect your heart. But vino could feasibly head off a cold. In one study in the American Journal of Epidemiology that took place in Spain, people who drank the most wine were less likely to come down with a cold than those who abstained or downed beer or spirits. Red wine has the edge, possibly because of its antioxidants. Experts say that women should stick to one glass per day for the most health benefits (and fewest risks). Cheers!<br /> <br /> <strong>Cuddle up to a book.</strong><br /> People who regularly read fiction are better able to understand other people and <a href= http://ideas.time.com/2013/06/03/why-we-should-read-literature/  target= _hplink >empathize with them</a>, studies show.

"5 Gifts to Give Yourself This Holiday Season"	"Another December has arrived and once again we are busily preparing for the holiday rituals that will take place as the year winds to an end. This is a perfect time to stop for a moment and really think about the meaning of your own celebrations, so that you don't end up spending a fortune in time and money with nothing real to show when it is over. <br /> <br /> This is the year that you should dedicate yourself to staying in the present moment as much as possible, no matter how crazy and hectic your schedule becomes. If you race through each day of the season, mindlessly completing the items on your to-do list, you can become exhausted, depleted and resentful and totally miss the joys of this special time of year.<br /> <br /> The solution is to give <em>yourself</em> some special gifts this year. I'm not talking about gifts that cost money or are indulgent, like a spa day, a fancy night on the town, or an exotic vacation -- though those things may be just what you need right now. But these are some  splurges  for the Soul -- activities that will help you find meaning in these holy days:<br /> <br /> <strong>1. The Gift of Solitude</strong><br /> <br /> No matter how busy you are, take some time out to be totally alone during part of one day or evening. Try to find a place to go where you will not be around other people and turn your phone off or leave it behind for at least one hour. I live in the mountains and it's easy for me to snowshoe on a trail above my house and walk in solitude for an entire day. But if you live in a city you may have to be creative: find a park where you can sit in an out-of-the-way grove, visit a little-used section of your local library, or find a time when you have your home to yourself, with no internet, television or radio to distract you. <br /> <br /> The idea is to be totally alone with your thoughts for an hour. During that time, take some deep breaths, think about the holiday that is approaching, reminisce about good times in the past, and contemplate what is most important to you about this season. Think of at least one thing you love about the holidays and plan how you can emphasize that activity or feeling in your life this year.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. The Gift of Spontaneity</strong><br /> <br /> Be watchful for opportunities to do something special that is not on your to-do list: wander through a local neighborhood to look at the lights, stop to listen to carolers on the street corner, take in the special window displays downtown, make a snow-angel or build a snowman if you live in a cold climate.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. The Gift of Wisdom</strong><br /> <br /> Spend some time reading from one of the great Wisdom texts available to us: the Bible, Bhagavad Gita, Kabbalah, I Ching, The Gospel of Thomas, Tao te Ching, the poetry of Rumi or countless other sources. Immerse yourself in the beautiful language and thoughtful sentiments in these ancient writings. As Rumi wrote:  Let yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love. <br /> <br /> <strong>4. The Gift of Hunger</strong><br /> <br /> This may not sound like a gift at all, but I encourage you -- just once during these holy days -- to skip a meal. In this season of baking, feasting, partying and frequent overindulgence, it is an interesting experiment to go without eating for part of a day. When you have felt hunger for a few hours you will actually appreciate the abundant food that surrounds you and remember those who are not so fortunate at this or any other time of the year. You might even want to donate the money you save from that meal to a local soup kitchen or charity.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. The Gift of Stars</strong><br /> <br /> Though it may be difficult for some, depending on where you live, I recommend going to a place one evening where you can look up and see the stars. Lie back for a brief time and study the vastness of the universe, reminding yourself how small we really are here on our beautiful planet. All of the rushing, shopping, buying, wrapping, baking, and entertaining that fill up your schedule are not really important when you consider the entire expanse of creation. But the <em>Love</em> that you feel and share with others rises above everything as what really matters during this holiday season. <br /> <br /> And finally, no matter which of the above gifts you choose to give yourself this year, I suggest that you spend some time writing about the experience in your journal. Remember to express your gratitude every day for this amazing life and all the blessings that have been showered upon you, during these holy days and all year long. May you have a December to remember as you bring this year to a close and share your gifts with the world!<br /> <br /> <em>And please accept a small gift from me this year: if you are interested in starting a journal or enhancing your journaling practice, you can download the  Journaling Starter Kit  on my website at <a href= http://www.karenwyattmd.com  target= _hplink >www.karenwyattmd.com</a> (no obligation -- you don't even have to sign up!)

"Sony Hack Reveals Spider-Man, Marvel Plans You Already Knew"	"Beyond the <a href= http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/scott-rudin-on-obama-i-bet-he-likes-kevin-hart  target= _hplink >outrageous</a> and <a href= http://gawker.com/channing-tatum-writes-emails-exactly-like-you-think-he-1670777558  target= _hplink >silly</a>, a lot of superhero news has leaked online in the wake of a massive cyber attack on Sony Pictures. But if the contents of the stolen emails sound somewhat familiar to comic-book fans, that's because so much of the information was already previously reported, sometimes before the email exchanges between Sony executives even took place. Ahead, a brief guide to all the superhero news you already knew about before the Sony Pictures hack:<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Spider-Man could have joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong></big><br /> While Spider-Man and Captain America are both part of the Marvel Comics universe, they exist in different realms onscreen. Spider-Man is a Sony property; Captain America and his fellow Avengers belong to Disney. But according to emails sent on Oct. 13 and published by The Daily Beast, <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/14/exclusive-sony-emails-reveal-destiny-s-child-and-kanye-west-movies-and-spidey-cameo-in-capt-3.html  target= _hplink >Sony and Disney discussed putting Spider-Man in  Captain America: Civil War. </a> One week before those notes were sent, however, on Oct. 6, <a href= http://www.hitfix.com/motion-captured/marvels-making-big-plans-beyond-avengers-3-and-its-making-hollywood-crazy  target= _hplink >HitFix writer Drew McWeeny alluded to the same thing</a>:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>While I can't get the confirmations I need to verify the story, I'm hearing that there are some very cool  Spider-Man  plans being discussed that would help Sony refocus their enormously important franchise while also opening up some connections in the onscreen Marvel movie universe that would blow fandom's minds. Will it work out? I don't know. I would love to be able to state for sure that it's happening. What seems clear from what I've heard is that Marvel wants to be able to play with all of their characters, and if they can make that work creatively and on a corporate level, they will, and that means the world gets bigger again.</blockquote><br /> <br /> On Oct. 7, one day after McWeeny's report published, Entertainment Weekly's Anthony Breznican revealed that  delicate preliminary conversations  <a href= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/10/07/spider-man-marvel-sony/  target= _hplink >were underway between Sony and Disney regarding Spider-Man</a>.<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Sony could reboot Spider-Man again</strong></big><br /> Following the disappointing box-office returns for  The Amazing Spider-Man 2,  <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/05/18/we-need-to-talk-about-spider-man/  target= _hplink >there was much discussion online about the future of Spider-Man</a>. The same thing happened inside Sony: As reported by The Daily Beast, <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/13/exclusive-sony-hack-reveals-studio-planning-another-spider-man-reboot.html  target= _hplink >Sony executives, in emails dated Nov. 13, had conversations about rebooting the Spider-Man franchise</a> for a third time. Three months earlier, on Aug. 4, <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/08/female-superhero-movie-spider-man-sony-810253/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com reported that similar discussions had occurred</a>. On Oct. 7, in a post that provided a rundown of various Spider-Man rumors, <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/07/rumor-spider-man-to-cross-over-with-the-avengers/  target= _hplink >Badass Digest editor Devin Faraci reported that one of Sony's options was to  soft reboot  Spider-Man within the studio's  Sinister Six  film</a>. That movie would have  a new actor playing a Spidey who works with the villains. <br /> <br /> <big><strong>There could be an all-female Spider-Man movie</strong></big><br /> A Sept. 20 email exchange <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/14/exclusive-sony-emails-reveal-destiny-s-child-and-kanye-west-movies-and-spidey-cameo-in-capt-3.html  target= _hplink >discussed a female superhero movie within the Spider-Man world</a> and the possibility of building a shared universe on par with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/08/female-superhero-movie-spider-man-sony-810253/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com also reported</a> on that news in August:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>Having pushed the next installment of its Spider-Man franchise out of 2016 and into 2018, Sony Pictures is doing a top-to-bottom revamp of its most important property, insiders say. And that includes a female superhero movie which is being eyed for a 2017 release date, Deadline has learned.</blockquote><br /> <br /> On Oct. 30, Faraci wrote that the potential project, called  Glass Ceiling,  <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/30/what-is-glass-ceiling-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-the-spider-man-movie/  target= _hplink >would bring together female characters in the Spider-Man world</a>.<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Joss Whedon might not direct  Marvel's The Avengers: Infinity War </strong></big><br /> While not part of Sony, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was discussed in emails too. One correspondence apparently revealed that  Captain America: Civil War  directors Anthony and Joe Russo <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/13/exclusive-sony-hack-reveals-studio-planning-another-spider-man-reboot.html  target= _hplink >would likely take over for Joss Whedon</a> on the third  Avengers  film,  Infinity War,  which will get split into two parts. That was known before as well: <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/13/robert-downey-jr-bringing-civil-war-to-captain-america-3/  target= _hplink >Faraci reported the Russos rumor in October</a>. In a November post about Daniel Bruhl joining  Captain America: Civl War,  <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/11/daniel-bruhl-captain-america-robert-downey-jr-chris-evans-1201284648/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com confirmed the speculation was real</a>:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>The Russos are building up their Marvel cred with this all-star outing, and I keep hearing they will step up to the ultimate Marvel all-star team and take the reins of The Avengers franchise from Joss Whedon, possibly with that next film that will shoot back to back.</blockquote> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 13:15:21 -0500"	"entertainment"

"Michael Keaton Is Not At All Jealous Of Ben Affleck's 'Batman'"	"Michael Keaton is <em>really</em> not jealous of new  Batman  star Ben Affleck. Asked in an <a href= http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/films/michael-keaton-i-m-batman-i-m-very-secure-in-that  target= _hplink >interview with Shortlist</a> if he felt envious of Affleck's turn in the role, Keaton expressed confidence in his legacy as the superhero.<br /> <br />  No,  he said.  Do you know why? Because I’m Batman. I’m very secure in that. <br /> <br /> The question was in reaction to other prior  Batman  actor Christian Bale's <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/24/christian-bale-jealous-ben-affleck-batman_n_6211190.html  target= _hplink >revelation</a> that he was jealous that Affleck got the part. Speaking to Empire, the star shared his reaction to the casting news.<br /> <br />  I've got to admit initially, even though I felt that it was the right time to stop, there was always a bit of me going, 'Oh, go on ... Let's do another,'  Bale said.  So when I heard there was someone else doing it, there was a moment where I just stopped and stared into nothing for half an hour. <br /> <br />  The fact that I'm jealous of someone else playing Batman,  Bale continued,  I think I should have gotten over it by now. <br /> <br /> h/t <a href= http://variety.com/2014/film/news/michael-keaton-says-im-batman-1201378884/  target= _hplink >Vanity Fair</a>.

"Can Amy Pascal's Career Survive Sony Cyberattack?"	"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Amy Pascal, one of the most powerful women in the man's world that is Hollywood and the force behind such critical and commercial hits as  The Social Network  and  American Hustle,  has had better days.<br /> <br /> The co-chairman of the studio and chief of its film division is under fire for racist remarks about President Obama's presumed choice in movies that surfaced in emails made public by the Sony cyberattack. Pascal also faces criticism for green-lighting the film that may have inspired the hacking to begin with:  The Interview,  which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as bumbling journalists tasked with killing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.<br /> <br /> North Korea has denied responsibility for the attack, but praised it as a  righteous deed.  Earlier this year, the country's foreign ministry said the film's release would be an  act of war  and promised  merciless  retaliation.<br /> <br />  The Interview  is not the first film to target political leaders, or even North Korea.  Team America: World Police  famously took aim at Kim's father, Kim Jong Il. This also isn't the first time a powerful executive has been dogged by private comments made public. But can Pascal's career survive such a double whammy?<br /> <br /> The 56-year-old thinks so.<br /> <br />  I'd be surprised if my entire legacy was based on the leak of the email exchange,  Pascal told industry website The Wrap on Thursday. Virtually unknown outside of Hollywood, her nearly 20-year tenure at Sony and Columbia Pictures has included some very well-known films, such as  Skyfall,  ''Superbad,  ''Salt,  ''Fury  and  The Equalizer.  Pascal was fourth on The Hollywood Reporter's annual ranking released this week of the most powerful women in entertainment.<br /> <br /> She apologized Thursday for the  insensitive and inappropriate  comments in her emails that she says are  not an accurate reflection of who I am.  Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin, who participated in the racist exchange, apologized as well. Rudin, incidentally, was a producer of  Team America. <br /> <br /> Pascal's decision to bring  The Interview  to theaters isn't as problematic as the unflattering image created by her own private emails, said branding expert Dorie Clark.<br /> <br />  She's on solid ground rhetorically when she talks about the fact that Sony Pictures Entertainment is never going to back down from releasing a film because of the threat of what hackers might do,  Clark said.<br /> <br /> Rogen thanked Pascal for having the courage to make the film at its premiere Thursday, where Sony took the unusual step of denying press interviews.<br /> <br /> Clark said Pascal's professional network will determine the continued viability of her career.<br /> <br />  What's going to decide her future is how close she is with her boss and what kind of relationship she has with the board. This scandal is survivable,  she said.  It depends on how many people there are in Hollywood who want to put a knife in her back. <br /> <br /> Clark said the studio's financial success under Pascal is likely to play into her fate, noting the company's revenues are up 13 percent over the past fiscal year. The studio underwent a multi-million-dollar cost-cutting campaign the previous year after a few flops, including the Jamie Foxx-Channing Tatum action flick,  White House Down. <br /> <br /> Crisis-management specialist Michael Levine said corporate leaders are far more forgiving of those who are generating profits, especially since Pascal followed the  four golden rules of redemption  after the email leak: Contrition, humility, taking responsibility and responding quickly.<br /> <br />  If one is successful for an organization, they're given every benefit of the doubt,  he said.<br /> <br /> Pascal and Sony did not respond to requests for comment Friday.<br /> <br /> The massive Sony hack not only revealed private emails sent by top executives, it also made thousands of employee Social Security numbers public and leaked five new Sony films, including  Annie,  which opens next week.<br /> <br /> The juiciest aspect, though, has been the emails, which offer an uncensored peek behind the curtain at how Hollywood does business. In one of the messages, Rudin called Angelina Jolie a  minimally talented spoiled brat.  Pascal and Jolie crossed paths this week at an industry breakfast event, but no fireworks flew.<br /> <br /> Ironically, the flap over the hack attack could boost box office returns for  The Interview,  which opens on Christmas.<br /> <br />  The circumstances are nothing anyone would covet or want in their marketing plan... But now that it's happened, it may end up helping the movie,  said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak.  It's raised the awareness of the film to an incredible level that it otherwise might not have enjoyed were it not for this situation. <br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Follow AP Entertainment Writer Sandy Cohen at www.twitter.com/APSandy ."

"Bill Cosby Says He Expects 'Black Media' To Remain 'Neutral' Over Sexual Assault Allegations"	"Bill Cosby says he <a href= http://pagesix.com/2014/12/13/cosby-to-media-stay-neutral-despite-rape-allegations/  target= _hplink >hopes the black media will remain neutral</a> in light of his recent sexual assault allegations, according to a report by Page Six. <br /> <br /> “Let me say this. I only expect the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism and when you do that you have to go in with a neutral mind,” Cosby told Page Six in a phone interview on Friday. <br /> <br /> This is not the first time the 77-year-old comedian has taken a dig at the media for its coverage of the allegations against him. In <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/19/bill-cosby-ap-interview_n_6188534.html  target= _hplink >a video interview with the Associated Press</a> on Nov. 6, Cosby initially declined to comment on the alleged sexual assaults, and then pressured the reporter not to air the footage if he wanted to maintain his  integrity.  <br /> <br />  Of what value will it have? I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,  Cosby told the reporter, while still on camera and wearing a microphone.  I think if you want to consider yourself to be serious, that it will not appear anywhere. <br /> <br />  We thought, by the way, that since it was AP it wouldn't be necessary to go over that question with you. We thought the AP had the integrity to not ask,  he continued. <br /> <br /> Cosby, who has been <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/09/cosby-accusers-cnn-special_n_6294404.html?utm_hp_ref=bill-cosby  target= _hplink >accused by over 20 women of sexual assault</a> spanning four decades, expressed similar sentiments about the media in <a href= http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/11/21/bill-cosby-to-florida-today-i-wont-mention-allegations/19367957/  target= _hplink >an interview with Florida Today</a> on Nov 21.<br /> <br />  I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos,  he told the publication.  People should fact check. <br /> <br /> Despite <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/24/women-who-have-accused-bill-cosby_n_6211290.html  target= _hplink >a growing number of allegations</a> against Cosby, he has never been charged with a crime.

Which is why many of them have begun decorating the virtual walls of their individual Toy Boxes.<br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas1.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-InfinityXmas1.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas1-thumb.jpg  width= 500  height= 264  /></a></center><br /> <br /> And what exactly do I mean by  ... their individual Toy Boxes  ? Or  virtual walls  for that matter? To properly explain what's now right going on within the world of Disney Infinity, I first have to pull a Scrooge and take you back to Christmas Past. To be specific, the 2010 & 2011 holiday shopping seasons. Which is when first the <a href= http://games.disney.com/disney-epic-mickey-video-game  target= _hplink >Disney Epic Mickey</a> platform video game and then the <a href= http://games.disney.com/disney-universe-video-game  target= _hplink >Disney Universe</a> co-operative action-adventure video game failed to win over consumers.<br /> <br /> Mind you, <a href= http://www.disneyinteractive.com/  target= _hplink >Disney Interactive</a> (i.e., the arm of The Walt Disney Company which handles digital entertainment) did have a bit of good news during this especially bleak period. Toy Story 3: The Video Game -- which was released in the Fall of 2010 -- had proven to be quite popular with gamers. Largely because this video game featured two distinctly different modes: Story and Toybox. <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas6.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-InfinityXmas6.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas6-thumb.jpg  width= 500  height= 255  /></a></center><br /> <br /> Toy Story 3: The Video Game in story mode was pretty standard stuff. It allowed gamers to move through nine different levels of play as they then recreated events from that 2010 Pixar Animation Studios release. It was when players put Toy Story 3: The Video Game in Toybox mode that things got interesting. Here in the Woody's Roundup section, players were allowed to create and then customize levels of this video game. They could even earn money that these gamers could then use to unlock new objects within this video games. And the reason that this particular feature was especially popular with players was that some of these objects came from outside the <a href= http://toystory.disney.com/  target= _hplink >Toy Story universe</a>. They referenced characters from other Disney / Pixar franchises.<br /> <br /> It was Toybox mode on Toy Story 3: The Video Game that led to Disney Interactive's big breakthrough. Given that players had really responded to the idea of being able to play with their virtual toys in a manner similar to the way that kids play with their actual playthings in the real world (i.e., To a 5 year-old's way of thinking, there's absolutely no reason that a G.I. Joe couldn't be the best friend and/or arch nemesis of a Ninja Turtle. There are no rules when it comes to playtime. The only limitation is that child's imagination), these execs wondered what might happen if they developed an action-adventure sandbox game that could then tap into the true potential of Disney's rich library of characters. Creating this virtual space where it might then someday be possible for Marvel characters like Spider-Man and Nick Fury to travel to Agrabah (i.e., the mythical Middle Eastern kingdom that Disney's  Aladdin  is set in) and then do battle with the Green Goblin in the Bazaar.<br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas7.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-InfinityXmas7.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas7-thumb.jpg  width= 490  height= 273  /></a></center><br /> <br /> Given that the Mouse had previously been so fiercely protective of its intellectual property, this was a big roll of the dice for The Walt Disney Company. The very idea that Disney Interactive was creating this action-adventure sandbox game where players would actively be encouraged to bring Disney, Pixar and Marvel characters together and then use their own imaginations to create elaborate new worlds & settings that these characters could interact in ... This was very outside of Mickey's comfort zone.<br /> <br /> That said, there were powerful Disney executives (chief among them <a href= http://waltdisneystudios.com/corp/unit/6/bio/245  target= _hplink >John Lasseter</a>, the Chief Creative Officer at Walt Disney & Pixar Animation Studios and <a href= http://marvel.com/comics/creators/3635/joe_quesada  target= _hplink >Joe Quesada</a>, Marvel's Chief Creative Office) who got what Disney Interactive was trying to do and then threw their support behind the project. As long as this new gaming initiative also gave players a Play Set option (EX: That fans of  The Incredibles  could -- in addition to using their own imaginations to drive the movements of these superhero characters while they were in Toy Box mode -- also have a more traditional gaming experience, one where they'd then be able to send Mr. Incredible and his family out into Metroville [i.e., the city that served as the principal setting for this 2004 <a href= http://www.pixar.com/  target= _hplink >Pixar Animation Studios</a> release] so that they could do battle with Syndrome), Mouse House managers gave Disney Interactive Studios & Avalanche Software permission to develop this action-adventure sandbox game.<br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas8.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-InfinityXmas8.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas8-thumb.jpg  width= 500  height= 298  /></a></center><br /> <br /> Version 1.0 of Disney Infinity debuted on August 18, 2013 and quickly proved to be the monster hit that Mickey had hoped it would be. But as they readied Version 2.0 of this action-adventure sandbox game (which launched on September 23rd of this year with a Marvel Super Heroes edition), what especially thrilled Disney Interactive executives was how creative DI fans were proving to be. So many of these individuals were loading top quality content up into their Toy Boxes and then sharing this material with the greater DI community that ... Well, Disney Interactive officials felt that they had no choice but to actually hire five of these folks and then make them part of the DI creative team.<br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas3.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-InfinityXmas3.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas3-thumb.jpg  width= 500  height= 260  /></a></center><br /> <br /> And what helped put a lot of these new hires on Disney Interactive's radar was the amazing job that some of these individuals did when it came to decorating their Toy Boxes for the 2013 holiday season. As Patrick Efird -- who is now a Associate Level Designer for the Disney Infinity Community but, this time last year, was just another player enjoying this action-adventure sandbox game -- recalled:<br /> <br />  One of things that sets Disney Infinity apart is that you can create any type of Toy Box you want. With this being the holiday season we've noticed a lot of our community members decking the halls of their Toy Box in fun and unique ways. There's just something cool about seeing Bullseye haul a sleigh being driven by the Hulk. <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas2.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-InfinityXmas2.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-InfinityXmas2-thumb.jpg  width= 500  height= 262  /></a></center><br />  <br />  For me personally this is something special because this time last year I was a member of the community and now I'm a part of the in-house team working with the community on future content. I've always been in awe at what the game's fans create and seeing it from this side it's even more impressive. <br /> <br /> So for all you gamers out there who sometimes get hassled by parents or friends for the amount of time playing a video game, feel free to share this story with them. Because sometimes (as Patrick Efird points out) what might seem like a creative obsession from the outside might actually turn into a career path. At least when you play Disney Infinity, I mean.

"Bond Producers Say 'Spectre' Screenplay Stolen In Sony Hack"	"LONDON (AP) — The producers of James Bond films have acknowledged that an early version of the screenplay for the new movie  SPECTRE  was among the material stolen in the massive cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.<br /> <br /> The producers said in a statement Saturday that they are concerned that third parties who received the screenplay might seek to publish it — and warned the material is subject to copyright protection around the world. The producers promised to  take all necessary steps to protect their rights against the persons who stole the screenplay, and against anyone who makes infringing uses of it or attempts to take commercial advantage of confidential property it knows to be stolen. <br /> <br /> The warning was issued by EON productions, the U.K. affiliate of Danjaq LLC, the U.S.-based company that co-owns, with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, the copyright to the Bond films and their merchandising.<br /> <br /> There's been speculation that North Korea is behind the cyberattack in retaliation for the upcoming comedy  The Interview.  That film depicts an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea has condemned the film, but denied the hack.<br /> <br /> The revelation is just the latest among the spectacular leaks that are causing continuing embarrassment for Sony.<br /> <br /> Highly sensitive material is being leaked almost daily, including an exchange between Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman, Amy Pascal. Rudin called Angelina Jolie a  spoiled brat  and made racially offensive jokes about President Barack Obama's presumed taste in movies.<br /> <br /> Rudin and Pascal have apologized.<br /> <br /> The next 007 adventure, —called  SPECTRE,  after the dastardly fictional terrorist organization featured in  Dr. No  — is so hotly anticipated that even the revelation of its title was a media event. It will be Daniel Craig's fourth film as Bond."	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 11:33:35 -0500"	"entertainment"
"Charli XCX Performs 'Boom Clap' & 'Break The Rules' On 'SNL'"	"Charli XCX was featured as the musical guest on the most recent episode of  Saturday Night Live,  in promotion of her sophomore album,  Sucker.  The singer performed tracks  Boom Clap  and  Break the Rules  off the album, which drops on Tuesday. Backed by an all-female band dressed to the nines in suits and red lipstick, Charli opened up with her  Fault in Our Stars  hit, keeping her spicy attitude relatively low-key. However, during her anti-school anthem, Charli upped the energy as she broke out some dance moves, matching her  nah nah nah's  with some big hip thrusts.

"Martin Freeman Combines 'The Office' And 'The Hobbit' On 'SNL'"	" Hobbit  star Martin Freeman hosted 'Saturday Night Live  this weekend, but Bilbo Baggins wasn't the only character the show put to good use. In sketch  The Office: Middle Earth,  Freeman combined what are arguably his two fan-favorite projects:  The Hobbit  and  The Office.  The premise is simple: Bilbo Baggins returns from his questing life to sell reams at a paper company. His workplace role is much like that of Freeman's  Office  character Tim: he's got a workplace rival -- Gollum -- who he pranks by sticking the ring in a mound of jello, and a boss detached from reality -- Gandalf -- who makes inappropriate sexual jokes. His boss's favorite nickname for him? Dildo Baggins. <br /> <br /> It's a pitch-perfect parody -- and in case you've been wondering, Bilbo Baggins now drives a Jetta. <br /> <br />   "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 10:08:07 -0500"	"entertainment"
"Bianca Del Rio, Interviewed and Reviewed"	"<p><center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 419  /></a><br><small>Photo credit: Jonathan Hernandez</small></center></p><br /> <br /> When the sixth season of <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em> began earlier this year, it was clear that Bianca Del Rio was a force to be reckoned with. Del Rio was a strong competitor from the start. Snuffing out the competition and dominating challenge after challenge, she won the crown and the $100,000 prize that goes with it. Yes, the check cashed, which is surprising because Logo is run by lesbians. That joke is one of the Del Rio gems I heard during her performance the other night at the TLA on South Street in Philadelphia. Del Rio is currently touring the country on her Rolodex of Hate tour.<br /> <br /> Opening with personal stories from her childhood, Del Rio recounts growing up with old-fashioned Cuban and Honduran parents. She plays a vintage video montage of childhood memories. This paves the way down memory lane, where we eventually find out the traumatic but true story behind the self-proclaimed  Queen of Hate.  Del Rio takes even the most controversial of subjects, like childhood molestation and bullying, and makes it the butt of a joke. The audience laughs awkwardly, not knowing whether she has gone too far with these personal accounts. But it is Del Rio's story, and we are here for the ride. <br /> <br /> Del Rio is strongest when interacting with the audience. The front row is the splash zone, and if you paid the VIP price and are lucky enough to be sitting close to the queen, then you can't cry when she comes for you. She mocked one audience member for her poor taste in clothes, and another for her poorer taste in men. Del Rio's razor-sharp humor and lightning-fast wit cut deep, especially when she tackles racial issues and stereotypes. But she is an equal opportunist with her satirically discriminatory banter. No race is safe, and she makes sure she lands a joke at everyone's expense.<br /> <br /> Del Rio ends the show with a montage of other drag queens from the <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em> franchise, which is about to embark on its seventh season. Here she offers her unfiltered opinion on each of them. This moment felt rushed. I wish there had been more time available for her to roast the other queens, as her opinions are usually on-point and hilarious. <br /> <br /> I went into the evening with high expectations, after having just seen Del Rio aboard the Al & Chuck Travel Drag Stars at Sea cruise, where she hosted a roast of Michelle Visage. She killed it there too, along with local Philly queen Mimi Imfurst, who surprisingly came out strongest (unlike her time on the show) amongst the <em>Drag Race</em> roasters.<br /> <br /> Seeing Del Rio perform live, which she lives for, you notice a regal quality about her. She was born for the stage. She relies on the live performance to fuel her post-<em>Drag Race</em> career. She can't release singles on iTunes like many of the other <em>Drag Race</em> girls. She doesn't lip synch or dance or impersonate Beyoncé. She is utterly original, though a comparison to another queen of comedy has littered headlines in recent months. <em>The New York</em> Times <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/fashion/bianca-del-rio-the-joan-rivers-of-the-drag-world.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >recently profiled Del Rio</a>, calling her  the Joan Rivers of the drag world. <br /> <br /> I had an opportunity to sit down with Bianca in her dressing room right after she got off the TLA stage. I asked her about being compared to Joan Rivers, what she thinks about local Philly queen Mimi Imfurst, and who she would cliff, marry, and fuck if she had the chance. <br /> <br /> <p><center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio2.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio2.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio2-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 422  /></a><br><small>Photo credit: Jonathan Hernandez</small></center></p><br /> <br /> <strong>Right now, what do you experience when you get off stage?</strong><br /> <br /> It's kind of cool. You wonder if it's right. You wonder if it's fun. You wonder if you've done the right job. The great thing is you had an audience. They showed up, and they supported you. For that I am eternally grateful. <br /> <br /> <strong>How do you feel about tonight's show?</strong><br /> <br /> I thought it went well. <em>[Hesitates.]</em> I don't know. The weird thing I have learned over the years is you can't overanalyze what you have done, because I will always have criticism about myself. As long as the audience had fun, it's good. You feel the energy from the people.<br /> <br /> <strong>How many times have you performed Rolodex of Hate so far?</strong><br /> <br /> Philly is our fifth show. <br /> <br /> <strong>How many more performances do you have?</strong><br /> <br /> We go everywhere. I don't mean that in a douchey way. We are doing it in San Francisco, doing it in New Orleans, Australia -- Perth, Adelaide, Sydney. It just continues, which is kind of cool. <br /> <br /> <strong>You just were on the Al & Chuck Travel Drag Stars at Sea cruise. How was that experience?</strong><br /> <br /> Amazing. Fun. It's always fun to hang out with the other <em>Drag Race</em> queens. I love Latrice. I love Adore. I love Ivy Winters. So it's great to be in the same company with all of them. <br /> <br /> <strong>The roast of Michelle Visage was amazing. </strong><br /> <br /> We had a good time. And Mimi Imfurst was hysterical. That should go on record. She was very funny. <br /> <br /> <strong>That will be on record!</strong><br /> <br /> She was really hysterical. I have always loved Mimi. Mimi is one of the first queens I met in NYC when I started there. She is amazing. She is brilliantly talented. Unfortunately, [<em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em>] didn't show that, so it's great to see her shine now. <br /> <br /> <strong>What was your greatest failure, and what have you learned from that moment?</strong><br /> <br /> So many. You have so many. I have done drag for 18 years, so you have ups and downs and everythings. And the weird thing is, as much as I would love to tell you a significant story, there really isn't just one. There were so many shit moments that you kind of sit back and go,  I'm sad that happened.  You don't know it is that bad until you get something good. And through it you just work. You have your life. For me it was a 9-to-5, and then you do drag shows at night. It's a journey you go on. There were good shows and bad shows and five people and 100 people or 200 people. With <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em>, in that moment, besides whether I won or not, because I was in very good company with Courtney and Adore, you have a golden ticket. You get to work. You have an unbelievable moment. I had never been to London. I had never been to Australia. I had never been to Scotland. All of this has happened because of the show. If you have faith in what you do, and you have consistency in what you do, you can be rewarded with work. I don't mean just winning. Courtney is working. Adore is working. Sharon Needles is still working. Mimi is working. It's about finding what works for you and excelling at it. It's about finding your craft. <br /> <br /> <strong>You travel a lot. How does travel affect you?</strong><br /> <br /> The travel is intense, but in the end, c'mon! I'm not flying the plane! What do I have to complain about?  I'm treated very well. It's an amazing opportunity. For me to complain about it would make me a total douche. <br /> <br /> <strong>You seem to really enjoy every moment and live in it. </strong><br /> <br /> Always. What would you be if you didn't?  I have been very fortunate, not just because of <em>Drag Race</em> but because of this journey. And you know the good gigs from the bad gigs, and you know people, and I have amazing friends. My friend -- and I can't even say the word  assistant  -- my friend is a part of my life for the past 15 years. And I needed someone near me to travel with. He is someone I trust and adore and have a great relationship with. It's never about kissing my ass. We don't discuss anything on that level. He is not a fan at all. He is my friend. And for that it's humanizing and genius, and that is what gets you through it. A lot of queens go through this process and lose sight of who they are. No, you are not conquering the world. It's work. And you have to have something to offer. You can be gorgeous. You can be a singer. It's all there for the taking. <em>Drag Race</em> and World of Wonder produce this show that is for the taking. <br /> <br /> <strong>Speaking of <em>Drag Race</em>, what do you think of the Season 7 queens? Any early favorites?</strong><br /> <br /> I don't know, because I haven't watched the promos. I am not going to lie: I saw the cast, and I know one person, Miss Fame, because she is from NYC. She is a beautiful queen, a makeup queen. But I don't know any more information about any of them. I purposely didn't ask for the lingo or information, because the hard part of <em>Drag Race</em> is to keep information under wraps. It's a hard feat. I didn't want any information about next season, because I didn't want to be overheard in a bar, because then they say,  Bianca said this,  and I didn't want that. I really don't know. It's an amazing opportunity, and I hope they all have a great experience. <br /> <br /> <strong>What did you do in Philly today?</strong><br /> <br /> I went to lunch with Courtney Act to HipCityVeg, and we had Philly cheesesteaks. Well, not real ones. I'm vegetarian, and she is a vegan, which means she is a pain in the ass. It was really good! We had a good time.<br /> <br /> <p><center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Bianca_del_rio3.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-Bianca_del_rio3.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Bianca_del_rio3-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 420  /></a><br><small>Photo credit: Jonathan Hernandez</small></center></p><br /> <br /> <strong>So we are going to play a couple of rounds of  Cliff, Marry, or Fuck.  Sharon Needles, Jinkx Monsoon, and Raja.</strong><br /> <br /> I would cliff [kill] Sharon, because she is annoying. I would marry Raja. Oh, no, but then that leaves me with Jinkx! This is hard. I love them all because of what they are, but this is tricky. I'll fuck Raja. Who is the other one?<br /> <br /> <strong>Sharon or Jinkx?</strong><br /> <br /> I love Raja. I can't get even go there. <br /> <br /> <strong>Chelsea Handler, Kathy Griffin, and Joan Rivers.</strong><br /> <br /> Well, Joan is an easy target. She is already off the cliff. But the thing is I would bring Joan back. I would marry Joan. Chelsea Handler, I would fuck her. Kathy Griffin? Not my favorite. <br /> <br /> <strong>While we are on that subject, <em>The New York Times</em> recently did an amazing profile on you. How did it feel when they proclaimed you the Joan Rivers of drag?</strong><br /> <br /> Surreal. As a faggot, as a little gay boy, anytime my name is mentioned with hers, it is surreal.  Winning <em>Drag Race</em> was amazing, but sitting in bed with this lady who I respected, admired, and loved, and getting a moment to film <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXg1fM4_ZMQ  target= _hplink >an episode of <em>In Bed With Joan</em></a>, was surreal for me. I don't get nervous. I don't get excited. I do what I do, and I think over the years you just do it. I have a good time. But that was different. I questioned,  Should be I over-friendly? Should I be aloof?  I didn't want to be any of that. I didn't know where to go. But once I was in a room with her, she made me feel totally comfortable. When that little inner boy realized that I was sitting in bed with Joan Rivers and she was laughing at something that I said, it was incredible. She was the sweetest, kindest, and most genuine individual I had ever met. As a comedienne, there are times when people are like,  It is <em>my</em> show.  I never felt that with her. <br /> <br /> <strong>It seemed like she was really impressed with you and your presence. </strong><br /> <br /> I don't know what it seemed like to everyone else, because, shockingly, I haven't watched it. I can't even go there, because what I felt, it doesn't matter what anybody else felt. I had that moment. I remember going into the car leaving Melissa Rivers' house (because that all happens in her basement). I was third of the four people filming that day, and I had a gig in some other city that day.  My manager told me that I had a gig and would have to shift it. I don't back out of anything, but it was Joan Rivers! I was like,  Bitch, no question!  They said it was the only day she could do it, so we said,  Let's do it.  Luckily that other gig reworked itself out. It was effortless to have a conversation with her. My heart was like,  How do you beat that?  It's just like talking with Ru. Surreal. <br /> <br /> <strong>One more Cliff, Marry, Fuck: Darienne Lake, Adore Delano, and Courtney Act.</strong><br /> <br /> I would marry Darienne Lake, because that is easy. Oh, God. This is horrible! This is hard! Does it matter what I would do with any of them? They all lost. It doesn't matter! You know what? I don't want to cliff, marry, or fuck any of them. I want to give them a job! They all lost!<br /> <br /> <em>For information on Bianca Del Rio's Rolodex of Hate tour, <a href= http://www.ticketmaster.com/Bianca-Del-Rio-tickets/artist/2007016  target= _hplink >visit the Ticketmaster page</a>.</em> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 08:46:14 -0500"	"entertainment"
"Why Were So Many Beloved Christmas Songs Written By Jewish Musicians?"	"(RNS) Christians don’t seem to mind that so many beloved Christmas songs were written by Jews, and Jews tend to reel off the list with pride.<br /> <br /> White Christmas. Let It Snow. Santa Baby. I’ll Be Home for Christmas. Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire. Silver Bells. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.<br /> <br /> Those not mentioned here could fill an album.<br /> <br /> But why didn’t the Jews write any similarly iconic songs for their holiday that falls around Christmastime: Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights?<br /> <br /> “I Have a Little Dreidl”?  Great song … if you’re 4.<br /> <br /> There are reasons that Jews are good at Christmas songs and why so many of these songs became so popular. And there are reasons why Jews didn’t write similarly catchy tunes for Hanukkah — or any other Jewish holiday.<br /> <br /> But first, a little music history.<br /> <br /> In the first half of the 20th century, Jews flocked to the music industry. It was one business where they didn’t face overwhelming anti-Semitism, said Michael Feinstein, the Emmy Award-winning interpreter of American musical standards.<br /> <br /> “White Christmas,” written by Jewish lyricist Irving Berlin, topped the charts in 1942 and launched popular Christmas music, encouraging many others — Jews and non-Jews — to write more odes to the holiday.<br /> <br /> And although celebrating the birth of Christ was not something these Jewish songwriters would want to do, they could feel comfortable composing more secular Christmas singles.<br /> <br /> “The Christmas songs that are popular are not about Jesus, but they’re about sleigh bells and Santa and the trappings of Christmas,” Feinstein said. “They’re not religious songs.”<br /> <br /> In their music and lyrics, Jews captured Christmas not only as a wonderful, wintry time for family gatherings, but also as an American holiday. What they drew on, said Rabbi Kenneth Kanter, an expert on Jews and popular culture at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, was their background as the children of European-born Jews, or as immigrants themselves, in the case of Russian-born Berlin and others.<br /> <br /> Jewish songwriters’ own successful assimilation and gratitude to America pervades their midcentury Christmas and other songs, and appealed to a country that wanted to feel brave and united as it fought World War II.<br /> <br /> “These songs made Christmas a kind of national celebration, almost a patriotic celebration,” Kanter said.<br /> <br /> The irreligious nature of these Christmas songs may not sit well with pious Christians, said Feinstein, who is Jewish and who cut “A Michael Feinstein Christmas,” among many other albums. But they are now part of the fabric of our larger culture, he said, and “any singer who is a singer of the American songbook will sing Christmas songs,” said Feinstein. “We all sing them.”<br /> <br /> Feinstein is in good Jewish company. Barbra Streisand made “A Christmas Album.” Neil Diamond cut not only “A Christmas Album,” but also “A Christmas Album, Volume II,” and then a “Cherry, Cherry Christmas.” This year, Idina Menzel, who started out singing at bar mitzvahs and is best-known as the strong, melodic voice in the hit movie “Frozen,” just came out with the very Christmas-y “Holiday Wishes.” This list is far from exhaustive.<br /> <br /> And how about Hanukkah songs?<br /> <br /> First, singers want an audience, and with Jews making up less than 2 percent of the U.S. population, and Christians nearly 80 percent, the natural market for Hanukkah tunes is relatively tiny. Though the story of Hanukkah is about religious freedom, a theme Americans can relate to, few know the tale of the ancient Maccabees — how they threw off their Hellenistic oppressors, and the drop of oil which miraculously lit their lamp for eight days.<br /> <br /> Feinstein, who was raised in a Conservative synagogue in Columbus, Ohio, said many people have tried to get him to lend his voice to a Hanukkah song, but he’s just not that interested.<br /> <br /> “They usually are in a minor key,” he said. “And there isn’t as much imagery that one can put into a Hanukkah song compared to Christmas.”<br /> <br /> There are still plenty of tuneful and moving Hanukkah songs, some of them in major keys — the rousing “Al Hanisim,” for example. But many are written in languages other than English — Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino — and aren’t going to get much airplay in the U.S.<br /> <br /> But a growing body of Hanukkah music aims to break through the subdued and somber stereotype.<br /> <br /> In 1982, for example, the folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary first performed “Light One Candle,” a social action song that invokes the Maccabees’ struggle.<br /> <br /> The Jewish reggae star Matisyahu came out with “Miracle” in 2011. And the Maccabeats, an a capella group based at Yeshiva University, remade the pop song “Dynamite” into a 2010 Hanukkah hit called “Candlelight.”<br /> <br /> And then there’s Kenny Ellis, the cantor at Temple Beth Ami in Santa Clarita, Calif., who is on a mission to convince Jews and non-Jews alike that Hanukkah songs can be a zippy part of the national songbook. Each Hanukkah, Ellis sings from his 2005 album, “Hanukkah Swings,” a big-band take on some of the most well-known Hanukkah songs, starting with “Swingin’ Dreidel.”<br /> <br /> To Ellis’ delight, Feinstein once sang “Swingin’ Dreidel” in his New York nightclub. It wouldn’t hurt if more Jewish singers tried a Hanukkah song or two, Ellis said. Maybe a whole album.<br /> <br /> “I love all the Jewish performers that do Christmas albums,” Ellis said. “But what’s the big deal about doing a Hanukkah album? Does anyone think that if Barbra Streisand did a Hanukkah album, that her career would be finished?” "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 08:05:34 -0500"	"entertainment"
"Sony Hack Reveals Spider-Man, Marvel Plans You Already Knew"	"Beyond the <a href= http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/scott-rudin-on-obama-i-bet-he-likes-kevin-hart  target= _hplink >outrageous</a> and <a href= http://gawker.com/channing-tatum-writes-emails-exactly-like-you-think-he-1670777558  target= _hplink >silly</a>, a lot of superhero news has leaked online in the wake of a massive cyber attack on Sony Pictures. But if the contents of the stolen emails sound somewhat familiar to comic-book fans, that's because so much of the information was already previously reported, sometimes before the email exchanges between Sony executives even took place. Ahead, a brief guide to all the superhero news you already knew about before the Sony Pictures hack:<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Spider-Man could have joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong></big><br /> While Spider-Man and Captain America are both part of the Marvel Comics universe, they exist in different realms onscreen. Spider-Man is a Sony property; Captain America and his fellow Avengers belong to Disney. But according to emails sent on Oct. 13 and published by The Daily Beast, <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/14/exclusive-sony-emails-reveal-destiny-s-child-and-kanye-west-movies-and-spidey-cameo-in-capt-3.html  target= _hplink >Sony and Disney discussed putting Spider-Man in  Captain America: Civil War. </a> One week before those notes were sent, however, on Oct. 6, <a href= http://www.hitfix.com/motion-captured/marvels-making-big-plans-beyond-avengers-3-and-its-making-hollywood-crazy  target= _hplink >HitFix writer Drew McWeeny alluded to the same thing</a>:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>While I can't get the confirmations I need to verify the story, I'm hearing that there are some very cool  Spider-Man  plans being discussed that would help Sony refocus their enormously important franchise while also opening up some connections in the onscreen Marvel movie universe that would blow fandom's minds. Will it work out? I don't know. I would love to be able to state for sure that it's happening. What seems clear from what I've heard is that Marvel wants to be able to play with all of their characters, and if they can make that work creatively and on a corporate level, they will, and that means the world gets bigger again.</blockquote><br /> <br /> On Oct. 7, one day after McWeeny's report published, Entertainment Weekly's Anthony Breznican revealed that  delicate preliminary conversations  <a href= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/10/07/spider-man-marvel-sony/  target= _hplink >were underway between Sony and Disney regarding Spider-Man</a>.<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Sony could reboot Spider-Man again</strong></big><br /> Following the disappointing box-office returns for  The Amazing Spider-Man 2,  <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/05/18/we-need-to-talk-about-spider-man/  target= _hplink >there was much discussion online about the future of Spider-Man</a>. The same thing happened inside Sony: As reported by The Daily Beast, <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/13/exclusive-sony-hack-reveals-studio-planning-another-spider-man-reboot.html  target= _hplink >Sony executives, in emails dated Nov. 13, had conversations about rebooting the Spider-Man franchise</a> for a third time. Three months earlier, on Aug. 4, <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/08/female-superhero-movie-spider-man-sony-810253/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com reported that similar discussions had occurred</a>. On Oct. 7, in a post that provided a rundown of various Spider-Man rumors, <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/07/rumor-spider-man-to-cross-over-with-the-avengers/  target= _hplink >Badass Digest editor Devin Faraci reported that one of Sony's options was to  soft reboot  Spider-Man within the studio's  Sinister Six  film</a>. That movie would have  a new actor playing a Spidey who works with the villains. <br /> <br /> <big><strong>There could be an all-female Spider-Man movie</strong></big><br /> A Sept. 20 email exchange <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/14/exclusive-sony-emails-reveal-destiny-s-child-and-kanye-west-movies-and-spidey-cameo-in-capt-3.html  target= _hplink >discussed a female superhero movie within the Spider-Man world</a> and the possibility of building a shared universe on par with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/08/female-superhero-movie-spider-man-sony-810253/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com also reported</a> on that news in August:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>Having pushed the next installment of its Spider-Man franchise out of 2016 and into 2018, Sony Pictures is doing a top-to-bottom revamp of its most important property, insiders say. And that includes a female superhero movie which is being eyed for a 2017 release date, Deadline has learned.</blockquote><br /> <br /> On Oct. 30, Faraci wrote that the potential project, called  Glass Ceiling,  <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/30/what-is-glass-ceiling-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-the-spider-man-movie/  target= _hplink >would bring together female characters in the Spider-Man world</a>.<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Joss Whedon might not direct  Marvel's The Avengers: Infinity War </strong></big><br /> While not part of Sony, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was discussed in emails too.

"Texas Weighs Allowing Open Carry Of Handguns"	"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Long depicted as the rootin'-tootin' capital of American gun culture, Texas is one of the few states with an outright ban on the open carry of handguns.<br /> <br /> That could change in 2015, with the Republican-dominated Legislature and Gov.-elect Greg Abbott expected to push for expanded gun rights.  If open carry is good enough for Massachusetts, it's good enough for the state of Texas,  Abbott said the day after his election last month.<br /> <br /> And if Texas, which allows concealed handguns, embraces open carry — rolling back a 140-year ban — it would be the largest state to have done so.<br /> <br /> Open carry drew wide support in the 2014 statewide election, and at least six bills have already been filed for the upcoming session, which starts in January. Abbott has already pledged to sign one into law if sent to his desk.<br /> <br /> Coni Ross, a 63-year-old rancher in Blanco, carries a handgun in her purse for personal protection and said she'd like the option to carry it openly on her belt if she could. She already does when she's on her ranch and feels comfortable with her gun by her side.<br /> <br />  In one-and-a-half seconds, a man can run 25 feet with a knife in his hands and stab you before you get your gun out,  Ross said.  If your weapon is concealed you're dead. <br /> <br /> Most of the country already allows some form of open carry of handguns, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a California-based group advocating gun control legislation.<br /> <br /> But Texas, California, Florida, New York, Illinois and South Carolina, which make up more than a third of the U.S. population and include six of its seven largest population centers, do not.<br /> <br /> Large urban areas have traditionally had the strictest controls on weapons in public because of concerns over guns in crowds and crime control, said UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, author of  Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.  He said it's  pretty surprising  that Texas still has an open carry ban that dates to the 1870s.<br /> <br />  We've been regulating guns in the interest of public safety, even in places like Texas, since the founding,  Winkler said.  The battle over open carry of guns in public remains one of the most heated in the gun debate today. <br /> <br /> Of the states that ban open carry, Texas easily has the most gun-friendly reputation.<br /> <br /> From manufacturers to dealers, Texas has the most federal firearms license holders in the country. It has few restrictions on gun ownership, and Gov. Rick Perry and state lawmakers have actively lobbied gun makers to move to the state.<br /> <br /> Texas allows the public display of long guns, such as rifles and shotguns, and open carry advocates have staged high-profile rallies at the Alamo and state Capitol. Concealed handguns are allowed inside the Capitol, where license holders can bypass metal detectors.<br /> <br /> But Texas still insists handguns be kept out of sight.<br /> <br /> Texas first banned the carrying of handguns  when the carpet-bagger government was very anxious about former Confederates and recently freed slaves carrying firearms,  state Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said.<br /> <br /> Overturning a century of law proved difficult, and a concealed weapons law failed several times until it finally passed in 1995 when Patterson, then a state senator, led the charge. Texas now has about 811,000 concealed handgun license holders, nearly equal the population of San Francisco.<br /> <br /> Even among gun supporters in Texas, the idea of open carry was considered too radical when the concealed carry law passed. Since then, the Legislature has expanded gun rights incrementally. It made the licensing of concealed handguns easier and, during the last three sessions, held heated debates over concealed handguns on college campuses. Open carry backers believe these debates helped rally support to their cause and that an open carry law will pass.<br /> <br /> Open carry opponents, such as Moms Demand Action for Gun Safety in America, say carrying guns on the street is less about gun rights than intimidation.<br /> <br />  There is no way to know ... if that person is a threat to moms and our children,  said Claire Elizabeth, who heads the group's Texas chapter.<br /> <br /> Despite the early momentum, there are no guarantees open carry will pass. Bills to allow concealed handguns on college campus appeared to have widespread support in 2009, 2011 and 2013, but were derailed by objections from universities and law enforcement.<br /> <br /> Most of the open carry bills already filed for the upcoming session would still require a license. One, by Rep. Joe Stickland, R-Bedford, would eliminate the licensing requirement for concealed or open carry.<br /> <br />  The idea is we're going to return our Second Amendment rights,  Stickland said.  I can't imagine what the citizens would do if they had to take a class or pay a fee to use their First Amendment rights. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 10:38:36 -0500"	"crime"
"Auburn Freshman Football Player Jakell Mitchell Shot And Killed"	"AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn freshman football player Jakell Lenard Mitchell was shot and killed Sunday morning at an apartment complex near the Auburn University campus, police and news reports said.<br /> <br /> Auburn Police Capt. Will Matthews told The Associated Press that police responded at 12:25 a.m. Sunday to a shots fired call the Tiger Lodge apartment complex, where the 18-year-old Mitchell was found. Mitchell was later pronounced dead at a hospital.<br /> <br /> Matthews said an investigation is ongoing and no suspects have been taken into custody. No further details were released.<br /> <br /> Mitchell redshirted this season for the Auburn Tigers out of nearby Opelika High School. He was expected to contend for a starting spot next season as a back and tight end.<br /> <br /> Mitchell missed his senior season at Opelika as he recovered from an ACL injury. He rushed for 392 yards and 17 touchdowns in 2013 as a junior.<br /> <br /> Sunday's shooting happened at the same apartment complex Desmonte Leonard killed three men at a party in the summer of 2012. The complex, located a few miles from campus, is popular with students and its name was changed following the 2012 shooting.<br /> <br /> Jurors convicted Leonard of capital murder in the shooting deaths of former Auburn football players Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips along with DeMario Pitts. Three other people were wounded.<br /> <br /> Leonard's attorney said the shooting stemmed from a fight and that Leonard fired in self-defense. Prosecutors argued that Leonard aimed at the victims and wasn't involved in the initial fight.<br /> <br /> Leonard will be sentenced on Jan. 20. The jury recommended life without parole, but the judge could still sentence him to death. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 10:27:27 -0500"	"crime"
"Hundreds Attend Funeral For Teen Burned Alive"	"BATESVILLE, Miss. (AP) — About 400 mourners packed a chapel in Mississippi on Saturday to say goodbye to a 19-year-old woman who was burned alive, among them classmates who used permanent markers to write heartfelt messages on her white metal coffin.<br /> <br />  Fly high, Jessica,  said some, a reference to the former cheerleader's aerial acrobatics, according to the Rev. Eric Greggs, one of three speakers at the 45-minute service. Chambers graduated from South Panola High last year and worked in sales at a Batesville clothing and gift shop.<br /> <br /> Alabama author Linda Oliver said Chambers had recently asked her to help write a book about her life.<br /> <br /> Oliver, of Birmingham, said Chambers approached her while she was packing up after a speech about her own book at an Oct. 25 church conference in the Batesville area.<br /> <br />  She thanked me for sharing some of the horrible facts of my own story  and then asked for help with hers, Oliver said.  She said, 'I want my story to be told.' <br /> <br /> Contacted later by email, Oliver was asked by an Associated Press reporter if she spoke with Chambers long enough to learn her story.<br /> <br />  No, sadly - there was not enough time that day for a long visit,  Oliver replied.<br /> <br /> The Rev. Larry Kilgore of Crowder Baptist Church, about 15 miles from the funeral home where Chambers' funeral was held, said she talked with him about personal problems, but had a relationship with Christ.<br /> <br />  Jessica was a young lady who just loved to be loved,  he said.<br /> <br /> He didn't talk about Chambers' problems:  I will not expose her in death,  he said.<br /> <br /> Greggs preaches at Community Church of God in Charleston, about 25 miles from Wells Funeral Home in Batesville, which live-streamed the service.<br /> <br /> He said a church member called last Sunday, the day Chambers' body was found, to tell him about her death.  I was struck with a heavy heart,  he said.  I got off the phone and told my wife, 'I don't even feel like preaching anymore.' <br /> <br /> But, he said, resurrection is the  good ending to the story. <br /> <br />  We will see you on the other side. Hallelujah. <br /> <br /> The chapel where Chambers' funeral took place seats about 400 and was full, said owner Tommy Wells.<br /> <br /> Police are reconstructing the last few hours of Chambers' life and are asking the public to come forward with information. So far, they have few solid leads, in spite of $11,000 offered in rewards.<br /> <br /> She was still alive when a passing motorist saw her lying near her burning Kia Rio sedan about 8:15 p.m. Dec. 7, and she spoke to rescue workers, District Attorney John Champion has said.<br /> <br />  We're not releasing what she said, but we're acting on it,  he said."

"Families Of Newtown Victims Take Steps Toward Lawsuits"	"<br>By Richard Weizel</br>                <br>NEWTOWN, Conn., Dec 14 (Reuters) - Parents of almost half  the young children killed by a gunman at an elementary school in  Newtown, Connecticut, two years ago on Sunday have taken initial  steps toward filing lawsuits tied to one of the deadliest school  shootings in U.S. history.</br>                <br>For a second straight year the leafy suburb has planned no  public events to commemorate the massacre, which left 20 first  graders and six educators dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School,  an incident that inflamed the U.S. debate over gun control.</br>                <br>The parents of eight of the children killed in the Dec. 14,  2012, carnage, which 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza ended by  shooting himself dead as he heard police sirens approach, have  notified Connecticut courts that they may file wrongful death  lawsuits in state or federal court.</br>                <br>Their initial court filings, related to legal entities  created in memory of their children, do not indicate who the  families could target in their lawsuits, according to a chief  court clerk for North Fairfield County Probate Court.</br>                <br>While the parents could not be reached for comment, a  spokesman for Bridgeport law firm Koskoff, Koskoff and Bieder  said that a lawyer at the firm had recently met with some of the  Newtown parents about potential suits.</br>                <br> Attorney Josh Koskoff has met with parents about legal  action,  said Geraldo Parrilla, a legal assistant with the firm.</br>                <br>While Newtown grabbed the nation's attention, school  shootings remain common across the United States. Some 95  incidents, including fatal and nonfatal assaults, suicides and  unintentional shootings have taken place across 33 states since  Newtown, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a group created  by the merger of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, founded by former  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Moms Demand Action for Gun  Sense in America, a group founded after the attack.</br>                <br> It's astounding,  said Shannon Watts, who founded the Moms  group.  There is no other developed country that would tolerate  this kind of gun violence around school age children. </br>                <br>Gun-rights advocates note that the Second Amendment of the  U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms and suggested  after the attack that armed guards in schools could avert future  violence.</br>                <br>Newtown, located some 78 miles (126 kilometers) northeast of  New York City, has razed the school that was site of the attack  and recently acquired the home where Lanza lived with his  mother, who he shot dead as the first act of his rampage. That  building may also be torn down.</br>                <br>Newtown plans no public ceremonies to mark Sunday's  anniversary of the shootings.</br>                <br> The second anniversary, like the first one last year, will  be recognized in personal reflection and remembrance,  said   Newtown's highest elected official, First Selectman Patricia  Llodra, and Superintendent of Schools Joseph Erardi, in a  statement ...  There are no formal or official ceremonies to be  held by the town or school district. </br>                <br>But a 12-member commission that includes four parents of  young victims of the attack is steadily moving ahead to create a  permanent memorial to honor the dead.</br>                <br> We are meeting monthly, but have taken December off out of  respect for the families who lost their loves ones on that  tragic day,  said Kyle Lyddy, chairman of the Sandy Hook  Permanent Memorial Commission that is entering its final phase  of recommending either a single or multiple memorials.</br>                <br>Lyddy said the panel is considering such proposals as an  outdoor park and gardens, and indoor murals and art exhibits. He  said the commission has not set a deadline because  Our main  goal is to get this right.

You had a plan for life -- start a new business, get involved in the school PTA, teach your sons how to ride bicycles and play sports, spend as much time with your friends and parents as possible, watch your children mature, grow old with your husband. You were optimistic -- a  glass half full  person who saw the silver lining in every cloud and often felt so much joy you thought you would burst.

The way you look at the world has changed. Your interactions with friends and family seem foreign. You've become much harder. No longer brimming with optimism, you are now someone far more realistic and still.

Jake is getting older. But Dylan is frozen in time forever. Even after two years, there's this denial that is still very present inside you. You have Dylan's baby teeth and a lock of his hair on your bedside cabinet, beside the urn holding his ashes. That's all you have of your little boy now. <br /> <br /> It hurts. It just hurts. You suppress your feelings as much as you can because you fear if you really let it out, you would never recover. If you started truly crying, you would never be able to stop. It would destroy you. <br /> <br /> And here's the thing -- you didn't have to be that mom. For all the moms and dads reading this now -- this doesn't have to be you. <br /> <br /> Because every gun-related death is a preventable death.  <br /> <br /> These are not random acts. You can't ever say,  This will never happen to me.  It can happen to anyone, at any point, at any place. You have to care enough and be insightful enough to do something before it's too late.  <br /> <br /> Taking action to protect children from gun violence can take many forms. For some people that means fighting for policy and political change -- that can be a long, frustrating road, and certainly not the only option. Small but meaningful actions create change. If you have five minutes,<a href= http://www2.sandyhookpromise.org/keep_it_safe_and_secure  target= _blank  > start a dialogue at the dinner table about gun violence</a>with your kids. If you have two hours, host a conversation with other parents. If you can dedicate one day a month, work with educators on <a href= http://www2.sandyhookpromise.org/know_the_signs  target= _blank  >how to better recognize the signs of children who may be troubled and reach out to their parents immediately</a>. But to do nothing? That doesn't honor the dead and doesn't protect the living.<br /> <br /> <center><img alt= 2014-12-14-IMG_4668.JPG  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-IMG_4668.JPG  width= 450  height= 350  /></center><br /> <br /> One of the most important actions families, schools, employers and communities can do is learn the signs of someone in crisis and then<a href= http://www2.sandyhookpromise.org/say_something  target= _blank  > intervene before they hurt themselves or someone else</a>. We need to teach kids better anger management and conflict resolution skills, because much of gun violence stems from anger and fear. Learning other ways to deal with anger and fear rather than striking out at someone is a good first step. We need to recognize the signs on social media -- and know the difference between someone who is just angry and someone who poses an imminent threat. Lines of communication always need to remain open between ourselves and our children. <br /> <br /> I am beginning to feel some of my old optimism returning, because more and more people are engaging around this issue. Our conversation is gaining momentum. I sense a sea change is coming. I know everything we're doing at <a href= http://www2.sandyhookpromise.org/  target= _blank  >Sandy Hook Promise</a> will protect more children. We're fighting a good fight. <br /> <br /> But after every sort of victory, there's also a moment of incredible sadness for me, for whatever happens, I know I still can't bring Dylan back. That hole will never be filled. No matter how many lives get saved in his name, or in the name of others, I can't go back. But <em>you </em>can go forward and make a difference.<br /> <br /> With love,<br /> Nicole Hockley, a.k.a. Dylan's mom<br /> <br /> <center><img alt= 2014-12-14-IMG_3811.JPG  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-IMG_3811.JPG  width= 450  height= 300  /></center><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <em>This post originally appeared on <a href= http://www.today.com/parents/sandy-hook-moms-letter-mom-i-used-be-1D80353426?cid=sm_fbn  target= _hplink >Today.com.</a> </em> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 11:50:33 -0500"	"education"

He goes from zero to Cujo in .05 seconds when he sees another dog on leash. Well, sayeth you, lots of small dogs bark at other dogs on leash. True. But we know people expect a lot from dogs in this day and age and when it comes to leash theatrics, Eddie's at the top of his game. Also true: he's made some progress. But lest his adorable little blond-ness let you think this is going to be a plug-and-play dog, think again.<br /> <br /> Granted, if there's no other dogs around he's wonderful to take for a stroll. He loves him some leash walks and yard time. But at the sight of another dog, all bets are off. It's Cujo time. </blockquote><br /> <br /> On the positive side, Eddie is housebroken, loyal and a huge fan of playing fetch. But he's <a href= http://hssvacc.blogspot.com/2014/12/a-full-disclosure-blog-three-reasons.html  target= _hplink >also described as</a>  socially awkward,  and it's said he steadfastly refuses to sleep in a crate, favoring human beds and couches.<br /> <br /> <img alt= dog  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2385384/thumbs/m-DOG-980x645.jpg  /><center><small><em>How does such a little thing take up so much room on the couch?

"Martin Freeman Combines 'The Office' And 'The Hobbit' On 'SNL'"	" Hobbit  star Martin Freeman hosted 'Saturday Night Live  this weekend, but Bilbo Baggins wasn't the only character the show put to good use. In sketch  The Office: Middle Earth,  Freeman combined what are arguably his two fan-favorite projects:  The Hobbit  and  The Office.  The premise is simple: Bilbo Baggins returns from his questing life to sell reams at a paper company. His workplace role is much like that of Freeman's  Office  character Tim: he's got a workplace rival -- Gollum -- who he pranks by sticking the ring in a mound of jello, and a boss detached from reality -- Gandalf -- who makes inappropriate sexual jokes. His boss's favorite nickname for him? Dildo Baggins. <br /> <br /> It's a pitch-perfect parody -- and in case you've been wondering, Bilbo Baggins now drives a Jetta. <br /> <br />   "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 10:08:07 -0500"	"comedy"
"Bianca Del Rio, Interviewed and Reviewed"	"<p><center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 419  /></a><br><small>Photo credit: Jonathan Hernandez</small></center></p><br /> <br /> When the sixth season of <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em> began earlier this year, it was clear that Bianca Del Rio was a force to be reckoned with. Del Rio was a strong competitor from the start. Snuffing out the competition and dominating challenge after challenge, she won the crown and the $100,000 prize that goes with it. Yes, the check cashed, which is surprising because Logo is run by lesbians. That joke is one of the Del Rio gems I heard during her performance the other night at the TLA on South Street in Philadelphia. Del Rio is currently touring the country on her Rolodex of Hate tour.<br /> <br /> Opening with personal stories from her childhood, Del Rio recounts growing up with old-fashioned Cuban and Honduran parents. She plays a vintage video montage of childhood memories. This paves the way down memory lane, where we eventually find out the traumatic but true story behind the self-proclaimed  Queen of Hate.  Del Rio takes even the most controversial of subjects, like childhood molestation and bullying, and makes it the butt of a joke. The audience laughs awkwardly, not knowing whether she has gone too far with these personal accounts. But it is Del Rio's story, and we are here for the ride. <br /> <br /> Del Rio is strongest when interacting with the audience. The front row is the splash zone, and if you paid the VIP price and are lucky enough to be sitting close to the queen, then you can't cry when she comes for you. She mocked one audience member for her poor taste in clothes, and another for her poorer taste in men. Del Rio's razor-sharp humor and lightning-fast wit cut deep, especially when she tackles racial issues and stereotypes. But she is an equal opportunist with her satirically discriminatory banter. No race is safe, and she makes sure she lands a joke at everyone's expense.<br /> <br /> Del Rio ends the show with a montage of other drag queens from the <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em> franchise, which is about to embark on its seventh season. Here she offers her unfiltered opinion on each of them. This moment felt rushed. I wish there had been more time available for her to roast the other queens, as her opinions are usually on-point and hilarious. <br /> <br /> I went into the evening with high expectations, after having just seen Del Rio aboard the Al & Chuck Travel Drag Stars at Sea cruise, where she hosted a roast of Michelle Visage. She killed it there too, along with local Philly queen Mimi Imfurst, who surprisingly came out strongest (unlike her time on the show) amongst the <em>Drag Race</em> roasters.<br /> <br /> Seeing Del Rio perform live, which she lives for, you notice a regal quality about her. She was born for the stage. She relies on the live performance to fuel her post-<em>Drag Race</em> career. She can't release singles on iTunes like many of the other <em>Drag Race</em> girls. She doesn't lip synch or dance or impersonate Beyoncé. She is utterly original, though a comparison to another queen of comedy has littered headlines in recent months. <em>The New York</em> Times <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/fashion/bianca-del-rio-the-joan-rivers-of-the-drag-world.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >recently profiled Del Rio</a>, calling her  the Joan Rivers of the drag world. <br /> <br /> I had an opportunity to sit down with Bianca in her dressing room right after she got off the TLA stage. I asked her about being compared to Joan Rivers, what she thinks about local Philly queen Mimi Imfurst, and who she would cliff, marry, and fuck if she had the chance. <br /> <br /> <p><center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio2.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio2.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-bianca_del_rio2-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 422  /></a><br><small>Photo credit: Jonathan Hernandez</small></center></p><br /> <br /> <strong>Right now, what do you experience when you get off stage?</strong><br /> <br /> It's kind of cool. You wonder if it's right. You wonder if it's fun. You wonder if you've done the right job. The great thing is you had an audience. They showed up, and they supported you. For that I am eternally grateful. <br /> <br /> <strong>How do you feel about tonight's show?</strong><br /> <br /> I thought it went well. <em>[Hesitates.]</em> I don't know. The weird thing I have learned over the years is you can't overanalyze what you have done, because I will always have criticism about myself. As long as the audience had fun, it's good. You feel the energy from the people.<br /> <br /> <strong>How many times have you performed Rolodex of Hate so far?</strong><br /> <br /> Philly is our fifth show. <br /> <br /> <strong>How many more performances do you have?</strong><br /> <br /> We go everywhere. I don't mean that in a douchey way. We are doing it in San Francisco, doing it in New Orleans, Australia -- Perth, Adelaide, Sydney. It just continues, which is kind of cool. <br /> <br /> <strong>You just were on the Al & Chuck Travel Drag Stars at Sea cruise. How was that experience?</strong><br /> <br /> Amazing. Fun. It's always fun to hang out with the other <em>Drag Race</em> queens. I love Latrice. I love Adore. I love Ivy Winters. So it's great to be in the same company with all of them. <br /> <br /> <strong>The roast of Michelle Visage was amazing. </strong><br /> <br /> We had a good time. And Mimi Imfurst was hysterical. That should go on record. She was very funny. <br /> <br /> <strong>That will be on record!</strong><br /> <br /> She was really hysterical. I have always loved Mimi. Mimi is one of the first queens I met in NYC when I started there. She is amazing. She is brilliantly talented. Unfortunately, [<em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em>] didn't show that, so it's great to see her shine now. <br /> <br /> <strong>What was your greatest failure, and what have you learned from that moment?</strong><br /> <br /> So many. You have so many. I have done drag for 18 years, so you have ups and downs and everythings. And the weird thing is, as much as I would love to tell you a significant story, there really isn't just one. There were so many shit moments that you kind of sit back and go,  I'm sad that happened.  You don't know it is that bad until you get something good. And through it you just work. You have your life. For me it was a 9-to-5, and then you do drag shows at night. It's a journey you go on. There were good shows and bad shows and five people and 100 people or 200 people. With <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em>, in that moment, besides whether I won or not, because I was in very good company with Courtney and Adore, you have a golden ticket. You get to work. You have an unbelievable moment. I had never been to London. I had never been to Australia. I had never been to Scotland. All of this has happened because of the show. If you have faith in what you do, and you have consistency in what you do, you can be rewarded with work. I don't mean just winning. Courtney is working. Adore is working. Sharon Needles is still working. Mimi is working. It's about finding what works for you and excelling at it. It's about finding your craft. <br /> <br /> <strong>You travel a lot. How does travel affect you?</strong><br /> <br /> The travel is intense, but in the end, c'mon! I'm not flying the plane! What do I have to complain about?  I'm treated very well. It's an amazing opportunity. For me to complain about it would make me a total douche. <br /> <br /> <strong>You seem to really enjoy every moment and live in it. </strong><br /> <br /> Always. What would you be if you didn't?  I have been very fortunate, not just because of <em>Drag Race</em> but because of this journey. And you know the good gigs from the bad gigs, and you know people, and I have amazing friends. My friend -- and I can't even say the word  assistant  -- my friend is a part of my life for the past 15 years. And I needed someone near me to travel with. He is someone I trust and adore and have a great relationship with. It's never about kissing my ass. We don't discuss anything on that level. He is not a fan at all. He is my friend. And for that it's humanizing and genius, and that is what gets you through it. A lot of queens go through this process and lose sight of who they are. No, you are not conquering the world. It's work. And you have to have something to offer. You can be gorgeous. You can be a singer. It's all there for the taking. <em>Drag Race</em> and World of Wonder produce this show that is for the taking. <br /> <br /> <strong>Speaking of <em>Drag Race</em>, what do you think of the Season 7 queens? Any early favorites?</strong><br /> <br /> I don't know, because I haven't watched the promos. I am not going to lie: I saw the cast, and I know one person, Miss Fame, because she is from NYC. She is a beautiful queen, a makeup queen. But I don't know any more information about any of them. I purposely didn't ask for the lingo or information, because the hard part of <em>Drag Race</em> is to keep information under wraps. It's a hard feat. I didn't want any information about next season, because I didn't want to be overheard in a bar, because then they say,  Bianca said this,  and I didn't want that. I really don't know. It's an amazing opportunity, and I hope they all have a great experience. <br /> <br /> <strong>What did you do in Philly today?</strong><br /> <br /> I went to lunch with Courtney Act to HipCityVeg, and we had Philly cheesesteaks. Well, not real ones. I'm vegetarian, and she is a vegan, which means she is a pain in the ass. It was really good! We had a good time.<br /> <br /> <p><center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Bianca_del_rio3.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-Bianca_del_rio3.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Bianca_del_rio3-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 420  /></a><br><small>Photo credit: Jonathan Hernandez</small></center></p><br /> <br /> <strong>So we are going to play a couple of rounds of  Cliff, Marry, or Fuck.  Sharon Needles, Jinkx Monsoon, and Raja.</strong><br /> <br /> I would cliff [kill] Sharon, because she is annoying. I would marry Raja. Oh, no, but then that leaves me with Jinkx! This is hard. I love them all because of what they are, but this is tricky. I'll fuck Raja. Who is the other one?<br /> <br /> <strong>Sharon or Jinkx?</strong><br /> <br /> I love Raja. I can't get even go there. <br /> <br /> <strong>Chelsea Handler, Kathy Griffin, and Joan Rivers.</strong><br /> <br /> Well, Joan is an easy target. She is already off the cliff. But the thing is I would bring Joan back. I would marry Joan. Chelsea Handler, I would fuck her. Kathy Griffin? Not my favorite. <br /> <br /> <strong>While we are on that subject, <em>The New York Times</em> recently did an amazing profile on you. How did it feel when they proclaimed you the Joan Rivers of drag?</strong><br /> <br /> Surreal. As a faggot, as a little gay boy, anytime my name is mentioned with hers, it is surreal.  Winning <em>Drag Race</em> was amazing, but sitting in bed with this lady who I respected, admired, and loved, and getting a moment to film <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXg1fM4_ZMQ  target= _hplink >an episode of <em>In Bed With Joan</em></a>, was surreal for me. I don't get nervous. I don't get excited. I do what I do, and I think over the years you just do it. I have a good time. But that was different. I questioned,  Should be I over-friendly? Should I be aloof?  I didn't want to be any of that. I didn't know where to go. But once I was in a room with her, she made me feel totally comfortable. When that little inner boy realized that I was sitting in bed with Joan Rivers and she was laughing at something that I said, it was incredible. She was the sweetest, kindest, and most genuine individual I had ever met. As a comedienne, there are times when people are like,  It is <em>my</em> show.  I never felt that with her. <br /> <br /> <strong>It seemed like she was really impressed with you and your presence. </strong><br /> <br /> I don't know what it seemed like to everyone else, because, shockingly, I haven't watched it. I can't even go there, because what I felt, it doesn't matter what anybody else felt. I had that moment. I remember going into the car leaving Melissa Rivers' house (because that all happens in her basement). I was third of the four people filming that day, and I had a gig in some other city that day.  My manager told me that I had a gig and would have to shift it. I don't back out of anything, but it was Joan Rivers! I was like,  Bitch, no question!  They said it was the only day she could do it, so we said,  Let's do it.  Luckily that other gig reworked itself out. It was effortless to have a conversation with her. My heart was like,  How do you beat that?  It's just like talking with Ru. Surreal. <br /> <br /> <strong>One more Cliff, Marry, Fuck: Darienne Lake, Adore Delano, and Courtney Act.</strong><br /> <br /> I would marry Darienne Lake, because that is easy. Oh, God. This is horrible! This is hard! Does it matter what I would do with any of them? They all lost. It doesn't matter! You know what? I don't want to cliff, marry, or fuck any of them. I want to give them a job! They all lost!<br /> <br /> <em>For information on Bianca Del Rio's Rolodex of Hate tour, <a href= http://www.ticketmaster.com/Bianca-Del-Rio-tickets/artist/2007016  target= _hplink >visit the Ticketmaster page</a>.</em> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 08:46:14 -0500"	"comedy"

"Sony Hack Reveals Spider-Man, Marvel Plans You Already Knew"	"Beyond the <a href= http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/scott-rudin-on-obama-i-bet-he-likes-kevin-hart  target= _hplink >outrageous</a> and <a href= http://gawker.com/channing-tatum-writes-emails-exactly-like-you-think-he-1670777558  target= _hplink >silly</a>, a lot of superhero news has leaked online in the wake of a massive cyber attack on Sony Pictures. But if the contents of the stolen emails sound somewhat familiar to comic-book fans, that's because so much of the information was already previously reported, sometimes before the email exchanges between Sony executives even took place. Ahead, a brief guide to all the superhero news you already knew about before the Sony Pictures hack:<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Spider-Man could have joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong></big><br /> While Spider-Man and Captain America are both part of the Marvel Comics universe, they exist in different realms onscreen. Spider-Man is a Sony property; Captain America and his fellow Avengers belong to Disney. But according to emails sent on Oct. 13 and published by The Daily Beast, <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/14/exclusive-sony-emails-reveal-destiny-s-child-and-kanye-west-movies-and-spidey-cameo-in-capt-3.html  target= _hplink >Sony and Disney discussed putting Spider-Man in  Captain America: Civil War. </a> One week before those notes were sent, however, on Oct. 6, <a href= http://www.hitfix.com/motion-captured/marvels-making-big-plans-beyond-avengers-3-and-its-making-hollywood-crazy  target= _hplink >HitFix writer Drew McWeeny alluded to the same thing</a>:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>While I can't get the confirmations I need to verify the story, I'm hearing that there are some very cool  Spider-Man  plans being discussed that would help Sony refocus their enormously important franchise while also opening up some connections in the onscreen Marvel movie universe that would blow fandom's minds. Will it work out? I don't know. I would love to be able to state for sure that it's happening. What seems clear from what I've heard is that Marvel wants to be able to play with all of their characters, and if they can make that work creatively and on a corporate level, they will, and that means the world gets bigger again.</blockquote><br /> <br /> On Oct. 7, one day after McWeeny's report published, Entertainment Weekly's Anthony Breznican revealed that  delicate preliminary conversations  <a href= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/10/07/spider-man-marvel-sony/  target= _hplink >were underway between Sony and Disney regarding Spider-Man</a>.<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Sony could reboot Spider-Man again</strong></big><br /> Following the disappointing box-office returns for  The Amazing Spider-Man 2,  <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/05/18/we-need-to-talk-about-spider-man/  target= _hplink >there was much discussion online about the future of Spider-Man</a>. The same thing happened inside Sony: As reported by The Daily Beast, <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/13/exclusive-sony-hack-reveals-studio-planning-another-spider-man-reboot.html  target= _hplink >Sony executives, in emails dated Nov. 13, had conversations about rebooting the Spider-Man franchise</a> for a third time. Three months earlier, on Aug. 4, <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/08/female-superhero-movie-spider-man-sony-810253/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com reported that similar discussions had occurred</a>. On Oct. 7, in a post that provided a rundown of various Spider-Man rumors, <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/07/rumor-spider-man-to-cross-over-with-the-avengers/  target= _hplink >Badass Digest editor Devin Faraci reported that one of Sony's options was to  soft reboot  Spider-Man within the studio's  Sinister Six  film</a>. That movie would have  a new actor playing a Spidey who works with the villains. <br /> <br /> <big><strong>There could be an all-female Spider-Man movie</strong></big><br /> A Sept. 20 email exchange <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/14/exclusive-sony-emails-reveal-destiny-s-child-and-kanye-west-movies-and-spidey-cameo-in-capt-3.html  target= _hplink >discussed a female superhero movie within the Spider-Man world</a> and the possibility of building a shared universe on par with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/08/female-superhero-movie-spider-man-sony-810253/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com also reported</a> on that news in August:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>Having pushed the next installment of its Spider-Man franchise out of 2016 and into 2018, Sony Pictures is doing a top-to-bottom revamp of its most important property, insiders say. And that includes a female superhero movie which is being eyed for a 2017 release date, Deadline has learned.</blockquote><br /> <br /> On Oct. 30, Faraci wrote that the potential project, called  Glass Ceiling,  <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/30/what-is-glass-ceiling-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-the-spider-man-movie/  target= _hplink >would bring together female characters in the Spider-Man world</a>.<br /> <br /> <big><strong>Joss Whedon might not direct  Marvel's The Avengers: Infinity War </strong></big><br /> While not part of Sony, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was discussed in emails too. One correspondence apparently revealed that  Captain America: Civil War  directors Anthony and Joe Russo <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/13/exclusive-sony-hack-reveals-studio-planning-another-spider-man-reboot.html  target= _hplink >would likely take over for Joss Whedon</a> on the third  Avengers  film,  Infinity War,  which will get split into two parts. That was known before as well: <a href= http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/13/robert-downey-jr-bringing-civil-war-to-captain-america-3/  target= _hplink >Faraci reported the Russos rumor in October</a>. In a November post about Daniel Bruhl joining  Captain America: Civl War,  <a href= http://deadline.com/2014/11/daniel-bruhl-captain-america-robert-downey-jr-chris-evans-1201284648/  target= _hplink >Deadline.com confirmed the speculation was real</a>:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>The Russos are building up their Marvel cred with this all-star outing, and I keep hearing they will step up to the ultimate Marvel all-star team and take the reins of The Avengers franchise from Joss Whedon, possibly with that next film that will shoot back to back.</blockquote> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 13:15:21 -0500"	"business"

"Congress Passes Historic Medical Marijuana Protections In Spending Bill"	"Congress dealt a historic blow to the United States' decades-long war on drugs Saturday with the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/13/cromnibus-senate_n_6321144.html  target= _hplink >passage of the federal spending bill</a>, which contains protections for medical marijuana and industrial hemp operations in states where they are legal.<br /> <br /> The spending bill includes an amendment that prohibits the Department of Justice from using funds to go after state-legal medical cannabis programs. If the bill is signed into law, it will bring the federal government one step closer to ending raids on medical marijuana dispensaries, as well as stopping arrests of individuals involved with pot businesses that are complying with state law.<br /> <br /> “When the House first passed this measure back in May, we made headlines; today we made history,  Rep. Sam Farr (D-Calif.), who in May introduced the medical marijuana protections amendment with co-sponsor Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), told The Huffington Post regarding the bill's passage. <br /> <br />  The federal government will finally respect the decisions made by the majority of states that passed medical marijuana laws,  Farr added.  This is great day for common sense because now our federal dollars will be spent more wisely on prosecuting criminals and not sick patients.” <br /> <br /> The bill protects medical marijuana programs in the 23 states that have legalized marijuana for medical purposes, as well as 11 additional states that have legalized CBD oils, a non-psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that has shown to be beneficial in some <a href= http://www.medicalmarijuanainc.com/index.php/investor-relations/57-latest-news/291-cbd-approved-for-epilepsy-research  target= _hplink >severe cases of epilepsy</a>.<br /> <br /> “Congress has finally initiated a drawdown in the federal government’s war on medical marijuana,” said Mason Tvert, director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project, in a statement. “This legislation makes it clear that the DEA has no business interfering in states’ medical marijuana laws. Taxpayer money should not be used to punish seriously ill people who use medical marijuana and the caregivers who provide it to them.”<br /> <br /> Under the Obama administration, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/26/obamas-drug-war-medical-marijuana_n_2546178.html  target= _hplink >the DEA and several U.S. attorneys</a> have raided marijuana dispensaries and sent people to prison, even though they complied with state laws. According to a report released last year by advocacy group Americans for Safe Access, the Obama administration has spent nearly $80 million each year cracking down on medical marijuana, which amounts to more than $200,000 per day.<br /> <br /> Under the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I substance with  no currently accepted medical use,  alongside heroin and LSD. Since that doesn't change with the passage of the omnibus package, it's not entirely clear how the protections will work in practice.<br /> <br />  This isn't finely written policy yet,  Farr said in June after the amendment first passed in the House, <a href= http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobsullum/2014/06/03/would-the-rohrabacher-farr-amendment-actually-stop-medical-marijuana-raids/  target= _hplink >Forbes' Jacob Sullum reported</a>. “This is a statement of congressional intent that [the] DEA [should] back off on these issues. We will have to continue to reconcile federal policy with state policy.”<br /> <br /> A statement issued by Americans for Safe Access following the spending bill's passage Saturday called the measure  historic  and said patients' rights advocates believe it  will dramatically impact DOJ enforcement, including ending federal medical marijuana raids, arrests, criminal prosecutions, and civil asset forfeiture lawsuits. <br /> <br /> Industrial hemp also received new protections from DEA intervention under the spending bill. The same plant species as marijuana, cannabis sativa, hemp contains little to no THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana associated with the  high  sensation. The farm bill, which President Barack Obama signed into law in February, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-/obama-marijuana-legalization_b_4768009.html  target= _hplink >legalized industrial hemp production</a> in states that permit it. <br /> <br /> Eighteen states have legalized industrial hemp production, and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/01/hemp-bills-us_n_5064741.html  target= _hplink >more than a dozen others</a> have introduced legislation that would authorize research into the plant, set up a regulatory framework or legalize growing it.<br /> <br /> Earlier this year, the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/13/dea-seizes-kentuckys-hemp_n_5318098.html  target= _hplink >DEA made headlines when it seized hemp seeds</a> intended to be used in the launch of Kentucky's legal hemp research pilot program. A month later, the hemp seeds were released, and the state began planting its research crop. <br /> <br /> It wasn't all victories for marijuana in the spending bill -- the legalization of recreational marijuana in Washington, D.C., which nearly 70 percent of voters approved, appears to be <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/omnibus-marijuana-_n_6301600.html?1418225607  target= _hplink >blocked</a>. However, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/12/pelosi-dc-marijuana_n_6316762.html  target= _hplink >several members of Congress</a> have taken issue with the language used in bill, arguing that law may still be able to move forward.

"Big Business: Buying Fake Instagram Followers"	"Did you know that you could purchase Instagram followers for just a couple of bucks? Social networks are aware of this new phenomenon, and they are clamping down on this questionable practice because some believe it deceives fans.<br /> <br /> The media spotlight is once again shining on the purchasing of fake followers. Recently, social media giant Instagram <a href= http://www.fastcompany.com/3039727/heres-why-your-instagram-follower-count-is-about-to-drop  target= _hplink >reported</a> that it would be eliminating all spammy accounts.<br /> <br /> The photo-sharing website isn't the only social media platform plagued with fake accounts. Its microblogging competitor Twitter has had its own problems with the infiltration of fake followers.<br /> <br /> Instagram has already started to deactivate and permanently remove these accounts. This move will certainly affect accounts that rely on fake users, such as bloggers, politicians, and celebrities.<br /> <br /> Whether intentionally or not, <a href= http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/profit-minded/10-people-won-t-believe-fake-followers-twitter-215539518.html  target= _hplink >public figures</a> have fake followers. During the 2012 election campaign, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney suddenly had a surge of <a href= http://www.cnet.com/news/mitt-romney-suspiciously-gets-116k-twitter-followers-in-one-day/  target= _hplink >116,000 followers</a> in one day.<br /> <br /> <strong>It's a big business</strong><br /> <br /> Of course, it may seem trivial to the average person. Why would someone buy fake followers on any social media outlet?  But this  follower economy  is in fact big business. A company that offers this service can charge anywhere from $5 per 1000 followers to $5 per 100 followers.<br /> <br /> For instance, according to the owner of <a href= http://www.ytview.com/  target= _hplink >YTView.com</a>, some clients and agencies spend more than $10,000 per month to buy <a href= http://www.ytview.com/p/instagram.html  target= _hplink >Instagram followers</a> and likes. Although the firm declined to reveal clients' names, it did note that several large companies and a few big-name artists and musicians are part of its clientele. YTView.com maintains more than 50,000 customers.<br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-YTVIEW.png ><img alt= 2014-12-14-YTVIEW.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-YTVIEW-thumb.png  width= 510  height= 442  /></a></center><br /> <br /> What do customers receive with such a service? Well, to sum it up: just a number. In actuality, these followers won't be reposting any of the user's content, initiating a conversation, or favoriting tweets and posts. All it does is show an immense following. To the public, the account will appear to be popular, which is good enough for interested buyers.<br /> <br /> The social media industry has become oversaturated in the last few years. Facebook has one billion users, while Twitter has more than 284 million. Therefore, to get noticed in a short period of time, small- and medium-sized businesses and startups take advantage of these services.<br /> <br /> Moreover, successful personalities with a large fan base can make large sums of money for endorsing products, liking brands, or retweeting comments. This generates a tremendous amount of pressure for Internet celebrities to garner a massive following to experience this same level of success.<br /> <br /> <strong>How can you tell?</strong><br /> <br /> Brands and personalities will likely never concede to acquiring social media followers. However, after investigating several accounts, experts say some patterns and trends exist.<br /> <br />  If you look at the fake accounts, their followers, and who they're following, some patterns emerge. Most of the fake accounts tend to follow thousands of people and don't have many followers themselves,  <a href= http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6097891/its-your-face-its-your-photos-meet-the-new-creepy-breed-of-instagram-spambot  target= _hplink >stated</a> former <em>The Verge</em> reporter Adrianne Jeffries.<br /> <br /> Jeffries continues by saying,  A subset of the accounts they are following have more than 10,000, and sometimes 100,000 followers. These larger accounts, like this one for <a href= http://instagram.com/nfengphoto  target= _hplink >@nfengphoto</a>, are probably the ones buying fake followers. <br /> <br /> In the end, the issue of purchasing a social media following isn't exactly problematic and may not be any of our biggest concerns as a society. However, it may prompt the public to ask: is this Instagram account's following organic or was it simply bought?<br /> <br><br /> <em>Image courtesy of YTView.com's website.</em> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 08:25:48 -0500"	"business"
"6 Credit Score Myths Debunked"	"<img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/NextAveLogo2.jpg  align= left  style= margin: 0px 15px 10px 0px;  /><em><strong>SPECIAL FROM</strong> <a href= http://www.nextavenue.org >Next Avenue</a></em><br><br /> <br /> By Steven Richmond<br /> <br /> You likely know that your credit score is the litmus test lenders use to determine whether you’ll be a responsible borrower and deserve to be approved for loans and credit cards. But there’s a good chance you have one or more misconceptions about how credit scores are calculated and what can nick yours.<br />  <br /> While the actual calculations used by the three major credit reporting bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian) are confidential and complex, the underlying concept behind them is fairly straightforward: if you have a history of paying your loan payments on time and in full, generally you’ll have a great credit score.<br /> <br /> Credit scores may seem a bit complex and convoluted. However, it pays to understand how they work so you can make informed decisions about your finances. Here are six of the most common credit score myths to stop believing:<br />  <br /> <strong>Myth No. 1: Closing out your credit cards improves your credit score. </strong>If you’re thinking about terminating a card to boost your credit score, think again before you reach for the scissors.<br />  <br /> Here’s why: One of the five factors that determines your credit score is your debt utilization ratio, which is how much debt you carry relative to how much credit is available to you. So when you close a credit card, your available credit decreases, your debt utilization ratio increases and your credit score drops because lenders see you as more of a risk.<br />  <br /> <strong>Myth No. 2: Closing a credit card erases its history from your credit report. </strong>Some people believe that once you close a credit card, its history disappears. This is false.<br />  <br /> Sure, it would be great if late payments and overdrafts on a card could be wiped away by closing the card. In reality, late payments and other black marks stay on your credit report for seven to 10 years, even if you close the card you made the mistakes with.<br /> <br /> <strong>Myth No. 3: Things like your age, race and sex affect your credit score.</strong> Here’s a quiz: Which of these two people is more likely to have the better credit score, a 60-year-old white woman who just moved to Massachusetts from France or a 25-year-old man born to Filipino parents in Oakland, California?<br />  <br /> It’s a trick question. None of that information is used to determine credit scores.<br />  <br /> Ever since President Ford signed amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act into law in 1976, creditors have not been able to base lending decisions on a borrower’s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age. Likewise, none of this information is used to determine your credit score.<br /> <br /> <strong>Myth No. 4: You’re penalized when you check your credit score.</strong> This mistake is easy to make because many people don’t understand the difference between a hard inquiry about your credit report and a soft inquiry.<br /> <br /> When you check your credit score and credit report with one of the three major credit bureaus, that’s a soft inquiry and doesn’t affect your score. However, whenever an outside party checks your credit score — typically when you apply for a new line of credit — that’s a hard inquiry. In this case, you do receive a small nick to your credit score because you have the temporary appearance of not being able to meet your financial obligations.<br />  <br /> <strong>Myth No. 5: As a cosigner, your credit score is safe. </strong>Some people think that once you cosign for someone else’s new line of credit — say, your child’s — your participation ends then and there. This couldn’t be further from the truth.<br />  <br /> For all intents and purposes, that loan or credit card you just cosigned for is just as much your kid’s responsibility as it is yours. If he or she misses a payment, exceeds their credit limit or defaults, both of you see your credit scores penalized.<br />  <br /> So before you cosign for someone else’s loan or credit card — especially a teen or young adult — make sure both of you understand the terms and what it’ll mean for both of you if there’s a missed payment.<br />  <br /> <strong>Myth No. 6: All credit scores are the same.</strong> False. The only credit scores that legitimately matter are ones you get directly from Annualcreditreport.com. Establish by federal law through the Fair Credit Reporting Act, this site gives you access to each credit bureau’s report on you for free once a year. Other sites simply estimate your score based on information you provide them; many critics will jokingly refer to them as FAKO scores (as opposed to the legitimate FICO scores).<br />  <br /> <em>Steven Richmond worked as a government and business journalist before becoming Editor-in-Chief of BadCredit.org, a leading site for consumer credit and debt news and advice, and CardRates.com, a guide to credit card rates, deals and information.

"Our Democracy is Dying"	"In case anybody hasn't noticed, democracy in America is dying now. This isn't an overstatement; it's a fact. Corporate interests dominate our politics so much at this point that our government, for all intents and purposes, is merely its handmaiden. Whatever Wall Street wants, Wall Street gets. Corporatism is the new order of the day. One political party stands for it; the other political party won't stand against it.<br /> <br /> The word inertia means the tendency of an object to move in whatever direction its been moving until and unless there's the introduction of a counterforce, and the Democratic Party is simply not providing the necessary counterforce to the corporatist agenda so exalted by the Republicans. Such a possibility is undermined by Democrats with corporatist agendas of their own. Watch them trying to sideline Elizabeth Warren as I write this. It's all gotten so terribly predictable.<br /> <br /> Some people are pussyfooting around the word, but others are realizing it's time to say it: we need a peaceful revolution in America. In the words of President John F. Kennedy,  Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.  The American people have simply got to stand up now. This isn't the time for any of us to go mute - whether it's those who feel there's no point in saying anything, or those who feel there's too big a risk in saying anything. And you know who you are.<br /> <br /> The social revolution we need is comprised of two major categories: What we say No to, and what we say Yes to. In the American Revolution, with the Declaration of Independence we said no to what we would no longer accept (living under British rule). In ratifying the Constitution, we said yes to what we would do instead (form our own system of government). The template was genius then, and it's genius now. Today, we need to say no to a situation in which our government is bought and paid for, and yes to a return to democracy. Nothing short of an historic, nothing namby-pamby-about-it, serious social movement will take us out of our free fall and set America back on the track to real liberty. Today, lobbyists - not the people - are in control. And that is not freedom.<br /> <br /> The situation has shaken out - and thank you, Senators McConnell and Reid for adding to the disaster of Citizens United by upping the amount people can contribute to political parties; that really helps (not) - in such a way that nothing short of a Constitutional Amendment will stop the big money flowing into our political campaigns like poison into the veins of our democracy. The best bet now -- given the resistance within both major parties to seriously taking down the dastardly  For Sale  sign posted on the front yard of our government -- is for the people ourselves to call for a Constitutional Convention, state by state. And that's what has started to happen.<br /> <br /> If something inside you says,  That's true,  then I hope you get active. We're in serious straits now and things won't get better by themselves. In denial about this? Go stand over there. Too cynical to think we can change things? Go stand over there. Too sedated to be upset yet? Go stand over there. An apologist for the system? Go stand over there. Ready to kick ass? Go to<a href= http://www.wolf-pac.com  target= _hplink > http://www.wolf-pac.com/</a> and express yourself big time. Work with that organization, or with any other you like. But this isn't a time to sit on the sidelines.

"Here's Some Painting Advice From George W. Bush"	"<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — George W. Bush doesn't readily offer political opinions, but when it comes to portraits, he has some broad-brush advice:</p><br />               <p> Never paint your wife or your mother. </p><br />               <p>Bush's new book about his father includes a portrait he painted of his dad, the 41st president.</p><br />               <p>Bush tells CNN's  State of the Union  that  I think it's nice,  but his tough-to-please mother  kind of wasn't  happy with it.</p><br />               <p>The 43rd president also painted his wife, Laura. The verdict?</p><br />               <p>She didn't like it and neither did one of their daughters,  so I just scrapped it. </p><br />               <p>Well, maybe not.</p><br />               <p> I may have saved it although they probably think I destroyed it. </p><br />               <p>Bush has said that an essay by Winston Churchill on painting inspired him to take lessons after leaving office.</p> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 12:51:50 -0500"	"politics"
"The Lame-Duck Congress Still Has A Few Big Things To Take Care Of"	"The Senate took care of the most pressing matter before the lame-duck Congress by approving late Saturday a $1.1 trillion spending bill that funds the government through September 2015.<br /> <br /> Among the big items left: —Dozens of tax breaks for individuals and businesses expired in January. The House has passed legislation extending them through the end of the year, so taxpayers can claim them on their 2014 returns. Senate action awaits.<br /> <br /> —Tax-free savings accounts for people with disabilities. The House has approved a bill to allow people with disabilities to open tax-free bank accounts to pay for expenses from education to housing and health care. The measure was added to the tax extenders bill.<br /> <br /> —Terrorism risk insurance. The federal government's terrorism risk insurance program expires at the end of the year, and its renewal is important to economic sectors such as construction and hospitality. The House has acted on a renewal, but not the Senate yet."	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 12:49:33 -0500"	"politics"

"Ron Wyden Says CIA Director John Brennan Has To Change Or He Has To Go"	"Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said on Sunday that CIA Director John Brennan has to change the agency's  culture of denial  or he has to go.<br /> <br /> Wyden is a leading voice on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which released a wide-ranging report on the CIA's post-9/11 torture program on Tuesday. The senator said the CIA's response to the release of the report has so far troubled him.<br /> <br /> Brennan gave a speech on Thursday in which he refused to call torture  torture,  and added that he would  defer to the policymakers in future times  on the question of whether the CIA should ever use so-called  enhanced interrogation techniques  again. That incensed Wyden, he said Sunday.<br /> <br />  What I'm especially troubled by is John Brennan on Thursday really opened the door to the possibility of torture being used again,  said Wyden.<br /> <br /> Asked whether he was comfortable with Brennan running the agency right now, Wyden said  not at this point.  But he refused to go as far as his colleague Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), who has outright called for the director's departure.<br /> <br />  I want to give him the chance to end this culture of denial, to deal with the misrepresentations. If he doesn't do that, we're going to have to get somebody who will,  said Wyden. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 12:15:54 -0500"	"politics"
"Dick Cheney Would Torture Again"	"Dick Cheney gave an unflinching defense of he CIA's post-9/11 torture program on  Meet the Press  on Sunday, dismissing criticisms of the program's forced rectal feedings, waterboarding and deaths.<br /> <br />  It worked. It absolutely did work,  said Cheney, a driving force behind the George W. Bush administration's use of harsh tactics in response to the 9/11 attacks.<br /> <br /> The Senate report on the interrogation program details forced rectal feedings that were medically unnecessary. But on Sunday, Cheney said the feedings were done for  medical reasons.  The former vice president showed little remorse for the dozens of prisoners who were found to have been wrongfully detained, for the man who died in the program, or for people like Khaled El-Masri -- a German citizen who was shipped off to Afghanistan and sodomized in a case of mistaken identity.<br /> <br />  I'd do it again in a minute,  said Cheney. He also spoke repeatedly of how the program was justified to get the  bastards  who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks.<br /> <br /> Cheney said he was more disturbed by the detainees released from Guantanamo and prisons in Iraq -- many under his own administration -- who have returned to the battlefield. He cited in particular the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was released from a U.S. prison in Iraq in 2004.<br /> <br />  I'm more concerned with bad guys who got out and released than I am with a few that, in fact, were innocent,  Cheney said.<br /> <br /> About the program's serious errors -- and the abuses that CIA Director John Brennan described as  abhorrent  on Thursday -- Cheney said,  I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective. <br /> <br /> The Senate report has led to new calls for former Bush administration or CIA officials to be prosecuted for the torture program they oversaw, but Cheney on Sunday dismissed <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/12/cia-torture-report-prosecute-senior-us-officials  target= _hplink >an appeal</a> from Ben Emmerson, the UN Special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, to reopen inquires.<br /> <br />  I have little respect for the United Nations, or for this individual, who doesn't have a clue,  said Cheney.

"Karl Rove Says Bush Knew About CIA Interrogation Program, Defends Rectal Feeding"	"Karl Rove defended the CIA and former President George W. Bush on Sunday in the wake of the devastating Senate report on torture.<br /> <br /> Appearing on  Fox News Sunday,  Rove claimed the brutal forced rectal feedings -- which the report said were not medically necessary -- were used out of medical necessity.<br /> <br /> All of the tactics the CIA used, Rove said,  were carefully designed with the principles in mind of our statutory obligations and international commitments. <br /> <br /> The Senate report suggests that the CIA went to some pains to keep the program insulated from Bush -- an opinion shared by former agency General Counsel John Rizzo in his recent book. When the president was finally briefed on everything that happened under the program, the report said, he  expressed discomfort  at the image of a detainee chained to ceiling, clothed in a diaper, defecating on himself.<br /> <br /> On Sunday, Rove said Bush was fully briefed on all of the CIA's tactics early on in the program in 2002, citing the former president's recent book.<br /> <br />  He was briefed and intimately involved in the decision,  said Rove.

"At the Heart of COP20: Loss and Damage"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BJAndministryofdefencestatuescop20.jpeg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-BJAndministryofdefencestatuescop20.jpeg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BJAndministryofdefencestatuescop20-thumb.jpeg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>Bianca Jagger at COP20, at the Ministry of Defence, Lima Peru</em><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am writing from Lima, Peru, where the 20th Conference of Parties (COP) for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was supposed to be coming to a close... there has been wrangling all night, the closing plenary of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) has finished without a concrete result. The COP President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal was meeting with countries and country blocs to see if agreement can be reached before decision-makers return home.<br /> <br /> The name of the outcome document that will result at Lima has been discussed. In the past we have had the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Accord, the Cancun Agreement, the Durban Platform and the Warsaw Framework. The name 'Lima Action Platform is being suggested, or LAP.' 'LAP' may end up standing for 'Lack of Action and Progress.'<br /> <br /> Over the past thirteen days world leaders and representatives from 195 countries, members of the business community, academics, NGOs, indigenous and grassroots organisations, a total of over 12,000 international visitors have descended on Lima. <br /> <br /> The aim of COP20 was to establish what each country's 'contributions' in the fight against climate change should look like. These 'Intended nationally-determined contributions', (INDCs in UN parlance), should form the basis of the global climate agreement that is expected to be finalized at Paris in 2015 at COP21. <br /> <br /> I have not been optimistic about the outcome of COP20 from the start. I fear this UN climate conference will go down in history as the COP which failed to make provision for the poorest and most vulnerable, that failed to protect the rights of indigenous people and local communities; that postponed REDD+ negotiations, and failed to promote gender equality.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-REDDSIDEEVENTCOP20.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-REDDSIDEEVENTCOP20.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-REDDSIDEEVENTCOP20-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>Bianca Jagger speaking at COP20</em><br /> <br /> <strong>COP</strong><br /> <br /> Oddly, the COP takes place in the Ministry of Defence, referred to by Peruvians as the 'Pentagonito,' meaning 'little pentagon.' It's a sprawling military barracks, with old army training equipment scattered across the grounds. A labyrinthine village of vast temporary buildings and tents has been put up, comprising 30 conference rooms and two plenaries for 2,000 people. The enormous windowless concrete Ministry looms over the whole. As I remarked to a colleague, somehow the site reminds me of Bosnia in the 1990s...<br /> <br /> There is hardly any provision for disabled people at the COP and woeful provision for those who, like me, have an injury. There were no lifts that I could see, and getting from place to place involved long walks in the heat. I walk with a stick. I found negotiating the COP difficult, so I can only imagine the challenge it presents for those who are disabled.<br /> <br /> Most of the events relating to indigenous communities took place at the Maloca, the Indigenous Pavilion, which was in the 'Jockey Club,' a horse racing track about a mile from the main COP. The Maloca was the only area I visited that was deprived of wifi - a tool crucial for networking, negotiating and decision-making. Getting to and from the Pavilion for indigenous events was not easy. There were no buses from the Maloca to participants hotels - we had to return to the Pentagonito and take a bus from there. <br /> <br /> Indigenous people are present in force at COP20 but tragically their voices are not being heard.<br /> <br /> <strong>ADP DRAFT DECISION TEXT</strong><br /> <br /> At about 2 am this morning, Lima, Peru time, a new draft text of the ADP was issued that could form the basis of an agreement in Paris. The decision text is fatally weak, does not respect the principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, is vague on financing, unbalanced, and overly focused on mitigation. The concept of differentiated responsibility is being diluted by new terms. Language relating to 'loss and damage' which is critical for developing countries has been removed. In short it is a poor basis for an agreement in Paris.<br /> <br /> All these shortcomings will affect developing countries and poor communities in disastrous ways. <br /> <br /> At 10.40 am this morning, the closing Plenary began, where countries responded to the text. Some including Malaysia, Sudan, Tuvalu, China, Cuba, Oman, Pakistan, my native Nicaragua and South Africa among others objected to the text, and refuse to accept the agreement as it stands. These countries called for negotiations on the text of the agreement to continue directly under the Peruvian COP President Manuel Pulgar Vidal. <br /> <br /> Ian Fry of Tuvalu, speaking for the Least Developed Countries, stated: 'This text needs a little surgery. We'd like to put on gowns and scalpels and insert some vital organs.' He also stated, 'Loss and damage is a crucial issue for the poorest and most vulnerable.'<br /> <br /> I was very surprised that after eloquently lamenting the loss and damage language, the Philippines agreed to accept the draft ADP text as it stands.<br /> <br /> Singapore described a lack of trust: the draft text is deviating from the Convention, there's backsliding on finance and commitments from developed countries. <br /> <br /> The Malaysian representative Prof. Gurdial Singh Nijar said, 'If you look at who is clapping in this room, and when, you realise we come from different worlds. Many of you colonised us. We started out at different points... The ADP process in Lima has been exhausted... This process was not given a chance until it was too late. This is unlikely to produce an outcome. You must recognise that there is a world out there, a disenfranchised world that is different to your world.'<br /> <br /> Nicaragua's representative Jaime Hermida Castillo said, 'the divisions over the draft agreement are a reflection of our world... We feel climate change right now, although we didn't create it. But we don't have the same resources to deal with it.' <br /> <br /> India echoed these sentiments, stating, 'Let us not forget the billions of poor. Let's not make the poor pay for this, but the polluters.'<br /> <br /> The ADP draft text has now been passed to the COP for further revision, under the supervision of President Pulgar-Vidal. The aim is to achieve a consensus today. He meets all blocs for 10 minutes each. He stated this morning, 'This is not a moment for proposals but for solutions. Let's work together.' We'll see. <br /> <br /> Human rights are not mentioned in the ADP. It is both inexplicable and unconscionable that the <a href= http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/IEEnvironment/Pages/IEenvironmentIndex.aspx  target= _hplink >concept </a>of human rights has been omitted from the draft text. 'A safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment is integral to the full enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to life, health, food, water and sanitation.' Climate change, and the harms it will cause, are fundamentally issues of human rights. <br /> <br /> The Philippines had proposed that the following language be added to the ADP: 'fair, inclusive, respectful of human rights and particularly rights of indigenous people and women.' <br /> <br /> Ghana and Mexico supported the addition of human rights language. Unfortunately I fear, there is now very little chance they will prevail. I cannot fathom why more countries did not support the addition of this language to the ADP. <br /> <br /> On the 10th of December - International Human Rights Day - the Special Procedures Mandate Holders, the largest body of independent experts in the United Nations Human Rights system, issued a <a href= http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15393&LangID=E  target= _hplink >statement </a>urging Member States to integrate human rights standards and principles in the climate negotiations. <br /> <br /> It's critical, their statement continues, since 'impacts of climate change interfere with the effective enjoyment of human rights. In particular, climate change has a disproportionate effect on many disadvantaged, marginalized, excluded and vulnerable individuals and groups, including those whose ways of life are inextricably linked to the environment.' (my italics). <br /> <br /> It seems they were not heeded. In the language of the Advanced Durban Platform decision text it appears that preambular language referencing  human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples  has been removed.  <br /> <br /> <strong>COP PROCESS, HISTORY</strong><br /> <br /> I have attended COP13 in Bali, COP14 in Poznań, COP15 in Copenhagen, COP17 in Durban, COP18 in Doha, COP19 in Warsaw and will hopefully attend COP21 next year in Paris. I truly hope that the UNFCCC will be able to achieve a global, legally binding climate deal next year but I have reservations.<br /> <br /> COP15 in Copenhagen should have been a turning point. It was a unique opportunity to set the world on the right path to avoid catastrophic climate change. For two days, most of the world's leaders congregated under one roof for a common purpose. Attended by 119 Heads of State, COP15 was the largest gathering of its kind held outside of the annual UN General Assembly in New York. The highlight was the attendance of US President Obama. <br /> <br /> The two weeks of meetings, extending late into the night, marked the culmination of two years of intensive negotiations. The conference was the focus of unprecedented public and media attention. And yet, the result - the Copenhagen Accord - was a shameful compromise.<br /> <br /> The words  legally binding  were conspicuously absent from the three-page text of the Copenhagen Accord. The Accord was merely  politically binding  for those countries that chose to sign up to it. Furthermore, it did not set emissions reduction targets for either 2020 or 2050, nor did it set a deadline by which the action points should become legally binding.<br /> <br /> The French newspaper Liberation lamented the speed and commitment to saving the planet compared with saving the global financial system:  We must make the bitter observation: when it comes to rescuing the banking system, the dialogue has been far more effective and determined. It is clearly easier to save finance, than it is to save the planet.  Since COP15 expectations have been declining steadily with each conference. At COP20, they are at an all-time low. <br /> <br /> After having seen the discussions in the Plenary this morning, I wonder how much we've learned since Copenhagen.  <br /> <br /> <strong>CLIMATE INJUSTICE</strong><br /> <br /> 2014 will probably end up being the hottest year since records began in 1880, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We have already matched 1998's temperatures, previously the warmest year on record. Time is running out. Inaction will lead to severe and irreversible damage. <br /> <br /> Climate change will affect everyone, everywhere, in every nation and in every echelon of society in the developing and developed world. We will all suffer the catastrophic consequences of: rising sea levels, desertification, food and water scarcity and political unrest. But some of the most vulnerable communities in the world are bearing a disproportionate burden of the harm without having significantly contributed to the cause. This is a terrible injustice.<br /> <br /> Hearing delegates' responses to the ADP text this morning, reinforced my opinion that there is a bias and injustice inherent in these negotiations. Failure to acknowledge different countries' different responsibilities can only end in failure. A comprehensive, legally binding, global climate deal must make provision for the rights of all and acknowledge that some countries are more responsible for climate change than others. We must achieve<a href= C:\Users\Bianca\Downloads\Climate Change Justice and Human Rights Report FULL.pdf  target= _hplink > Climate Justice</a>, a recognition that climate change will disproportionately affect people who have less ability to prevent, adapt or otherwise respond to increasingly extreme weather events, rising sea levels and increasing resource scarcity. <br /> <br /> The COP has always drawn lines drawn between the 'haves' and the 'have nots', between so-called 'developing countries' and the developed world, between the 'global north' and 'global south.' The climate talks are often fraught with bias and discrimination towards the global south, women, indigenous people and the poor as well as protesters. Their voices and that of civil society are often ignored in negotiations. <br /> <br /> Sometimes even freedom of expression is curtailed at the COP, as we have seen here this week.  <br /> <br /> COP rules require protesters to submit their banners and slogans for approval, and prohibit the mention of specific names, officials and projects. Alyssa Johnson Kurts, with the US youth delegation SustainUS told Democracy Now,  We tried to submit a banner that would have an arrow with Keystone XL in one direction and a liveable future in the other direction, and they rejected that proposal,  she says. <br /> <br /> In contrast, very few restrictions are placed on the fossil fuel companies that come to the COP. Corporations and fossil fuel companies have always had a presence at the negotiations. Yesterday, December 12th, 350.org delivered a petition with 53,000 signatures to the COP organisers, calling for fossil fuel corporations and their lobbyists to be banned from the negotiations.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://350.org/press-release/53000-call-on-unfccc-to-ban-fossil-fuel-corporations-from-the-climate-talks/  target= _hplink >Hoda Baraka, </a>Global Communications Manager for 350.org, said 'The fossil fuel industry is actively lobbying against climate action and standing in the way of progress. When you're trying to burn the table down, you don't deserve a seat at it.'<br /> <br /> <strong>REDD+ </strong><br /> <br /> REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) was identified as a key area of focus for Lima. COP20 President, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, announced forests as a critical theme and set the goal of realising  progress made in regards to the role of forests (REDD+).  REDD+ is our opportunity to make a global commitment to forest conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.<br /> <br /> It is critical that these developments should respond to the concerns of indigenous people and guarantee full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in all processes, programmes and actions at all levels, including their access to funding mechanisms, financing and capacity building. This must include a robust and enforceable system of social, environmental and human rights safeguards.<br /> <br /> REDD+ is beset by a fundamental difference in thinking. Some see REDD+ as an important framework that will bring both forest preservation and will benefit indigenous tribes. <a href= http://www.regnskog.no/en/rainforest-foundation-norway  target= _hplink >Rainforest Foundation Norway </a>for example has  a rights-based approach to rainforest protection. We believe that the peoples who for generations have developed their cultures and societies in balanced interaction with the highly complex yet vulnerable ecosystems of the rainforest have fundamental rights to these areas. Legal recognition of the collective territorial and cultural rights of forest-based peoples and communities is crucial to the fulfilment of their human rights. It is also a major prerequisite for protecting the rainforest.  Unfortunately there is another school of thought, dangerous dissenters who see REDD+ only as a profit making new market that exists to be exploited.<br /> <br /> The negotiations and decision-making should have been easy - protecting and advancing the land rights of indigenous people will advance their human rights protections and will also reduce cumulative carbon emissions through healthy and flourishing forests. But the REDD+ negotiations at COP20 collapsed. Climate justice remains a long way off.<br /> <br /> I gave the keynote address at the REDD+ Implementation Working Group: Legal and Governance Foundations, Indigenous Peoples Rights and Safeguards on December 5th... Morale was low among the negotiators, and sure enough, negotiations reached a deadlock, or REDDLock, and came to a complete halt that Friday here in Lima. <br /> <br /> The REDD+ talks broke down in part because there has been no agreement on guidance for the safeguards. Countries like the United States and Norway were pushing for more clarity on how these safeguards are reported, but nations like Brazil and Panama among others claimed guidance would be burdensome, slowing implementation of forest protection measures.<br /> <br /> The REDD+ Safeguards Working Group stated as far back as Cop15, 'No rights, no REDD.'<br /> <br /> Shamefully, there will be no concrete outcome on forest protection at COP 20, despite this COP being held in Peru, one of the world's largest rainforest countries. Deliberations have concluded for this session.  <br /> <br /> Once again, a critical decision regarding indigenous rights and environmental protection has been postponed until the next UNFCCC inter-sessional meeting in June 2015. Time is running out.<br /> <br /> <strong>FORESTS</strong><br /> <br /> As I said in all the five presentations I made at COP20, forests of all kinds are essential to our future. The Amazon in particular is home to about a third of our planet's terrestrial life forms, cycles nearly a quarter of the Earth's freshwater, absorbs around 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year and plays a vital role in moderating the climate. <br /> <br /> More than 1.6 billion people depend on forests for food, water, fuel, medicines, traditional cultures and livelihoods. Forests support up to 80% of biodiversity on earth and play a vital role in safeguarding the climate by naturally sequestering carbon. <br /> <br /> Globally, deforestation accounts for up to 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, or roughly 5.8 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent released into the atmosphere, each year. This is more than global transport and aviation combined. According to the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, reducing deforestation is the  single largest opportunity for cost-effective and immediate reductions of carbon emissions. <br /> <br /> The organisation I founded and Chair, the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation (BJHRF) and I are committed to forest conservation. That is why, in 2012, I became IUCN Ambassador for the Bonn Challenge, the largest restoration initiative the world has ever seen. The objective of the Bonn Challenge is to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land across the world by 2020. There are 2 billion hectares of degraded and deforested land across the world with potential for restoration. Restoring 150 million hectares would capture 47 Gigatonnes of CO2, and reduce the emissions gap by 17%. Forest restoration is invaluable in the race to tackle climate change.<br /> <br /> Already more than 51 million hectares of land have been committed to the Bonn Challenge, from the following countries: United States, Rwanda, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the Brazilian Mata Atlantica Restoration Pact, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Niger, Colombia, Ethiopia and Guatemala.<br /> <br /> <strong>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND THE FORESTS</strong><br /> <br /> During my participation at COP20, I spoke at several events that addressed the issue of indigenous people's rights, their land and the forest. On December 8th I spoke at the Indigenous people's Hearing on Deforestation and Indigenous Peoples at the Museum of Art in Lima, and the Tri-Caucus and Human Rights & Climate Change Working Group celebration of the first ever Human Rights Day at the UNFCCC on December 10th. I heard many moving testimonies.<br />  <br /> At both events, there weren't enough translators, or enough headphones to go around, and many of the audience didn't speak English - so I did my own translation and switched between English and Spanish throughout the speeches.<br /> <br /> For most of my life I have believed that in order to tackle climate change, we need the forests. In order to protect the forests, we need indigenous people: their wisdom and knowledge. Indigenous people should be at the centre of climate change negotiations. They have been proven the best custodians of ecosystems. <br /> <br /> A <a href= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17583004.2014.990680  target= _hplink >report </a>released on the second of December, titled 'Forest Carbon in Amazonia: The Unrecognised Contribution of Indigenous Territories and Protected Natural Areas' proves what I have long known: that indigenous territories achieve nearly one third (32.8%) of the Amazon's carbon storage - equivalent to all of the forests in the Democratic Republic of Congo. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BELOMONTETODAY.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-BELOMONTETODAY.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BELOMONTETODAY-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>The Belo Monte dam in 2014. When I visited in 2012, this was still a river flowing through a rainforest.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>INDIGENOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS</strong><br /> <br /> I was hoping that COP20 in Peru, the heartland of many indigenous tribes. would be the conference where we were finally going to address the issue of indigenous people's rights. <br /> <br /> Tragically indigenous rights are being violated all over the world. They are under siege from unscrupulous governments, mining, drilling, dams, logging and development. Rather than being empowered to use their ecological wisdom and understanding to protect and restore the rain forests, indigenous people face persecution in many corners of the world: murder, abuse and human rights violations: including here in Peru.  <br /> <br /> In September this year, in the Ucayali province to the west of Lima, Edwin Chota Valera, Leoncio Quincima Meléndez, Jorge Ríos Pérez and Francisco Pinedo of the Ashéninka tribe were murdered. Valera was the chief of the Ashéninka. They were killed for defending the rainforest that their communities depend on. Perez's daughter told<a href= http://www.newsweek.com/2014/11/28/dismembered-bodies-raise-stakes-amazonian-tribes-286169.html  target= _hplink > Newsweek</a>,  It feels like a knife in my heart. Nothing will cure it. It will last forever. My father fought, and we will go on until we get change or we die.  <br /> <br /> As natural resources become scarcer, and the pressure upon them increases with increasing population, disputes over land rights, particularly where oil exploration, hydroelectric, mining agribusiness and logging are concerned, are intensifying. Indigenous communities are particularly hard hit and their fundamental rights to life and land are violated in many countries throughout the world.<br /> <br /> I was shocked and grieved to learn on Sunday 7th December that the body of Jose Isidro Tendetza, former vice-president of the Shuar Federation of Zamora, Ecuador, had been found. He had been missing since November 28th, since he set off to a meeting of campaigners against the Mirador copper mine, which is threatening to decimate the Shuar's ancestral land. <br /> <br /> That same Sunday I met with Ecuadorian Minister of the Environment Lorena Tapia to urge her government to do everything in their power to investigate this terrible crime.<br /> <br /> Global Witness's Deadly Environment <a href= http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Deadly%20Environment.pdf  target= _hplink >report,</a> published in December 2013, named Peru as the fourth worst country in the world for such killings, with almost 60 murders since 2002. <br /> <br /> The Philippines is in third place with 67 murders, followed by Honduras in second place with 109. Brazil holds the dubious honour of first place, with 448 murders.<br /> <br /> <strong>BRAZIL - DAMS IN THE AMAZON</strong><br /> <br /> Brazil's New Constitution of 1988 was pioneering, a significant step for indigenous peoples' rights. It called for the demarcation of all indigenous lands in Brazil by 1993. As a result thousands of forest peoples were granted the right to their ancestral land which they need for subsistence or spiritual heritage. <br /> <br /> In the past Brazil had an average of thirteen demarcations per year. Unfortunately under President Dilma Rousseff's administration, which favours development, large-scale agriculture projects, hydroelectric mega dams, plantations, drilling and mining operations, the number of demarcations has sunk to three a year.<br /> <br /> Even with demarcation, ancestral land is not safe. <br /> <br /> For many years I have been supporting the communities and indigenous people threatened by the Belo Monte, Madeira and the Tapajós Dam complexes in Brazil. I went on a fact-finding mission to Xingu and the Madeira Rivers in 2012. The dams will impact hundreds of tribes; tens of thousands of people. I published a report on the Huffington Post, titled, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bianca-jagger/the-belo-monte-dam-an-env_b_1614057.html  target= _hplink >'Belo Monte: An Environmental Crime.</a>' I urge you to read it. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BiancaJaggeronafactfindingmissiontodocumentthedestructionoftheBeleMonteDamintheXinguRiverBrazilianAmazonMarch2012.JPG ><img alt= 2014-12-14-BiancaJaggeronafactfindingmissiontodocumentthedestructionoftheBeleMonteDamintheXinguRiverBrazilianAmazonMarch2012.JPG  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BiancaJaggeronafactfindingmissiontodocumentthedestructionoftheBeleMonteDamintheXinguRiverBrazilianAmazonMarch2012-thumb.JPG  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>Bianca Jagger on the Xingu River</em><br /> <br /> The Brazilian Government appears to have abandoned its people in the name of profit, energy and 'development.' In the Tapajós basin, in the heart of the Amazon, the government plans to construct up to 29 large dams, following the same destructive model as Belo Monte. One tribe in the region, the Mundukuru, a proud warrior tribe, are continuing to resist the planned Tapajós development. They have decided to auto-demarcate their territory in response to the Rousseff administration's refusal to recognise their land rights.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-MUNDURUKUTRIBLEPROTESTINGTHETAPAJOSDAMSBYAaronVincentElkaim.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-MUNDURUKUTRIBLEPROTESTINGTHETAPAJOSDAMSBYAaronVincentElkaim.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-MUNDURUKUTRIBLEPROTESTINGTHETAPAJOSDAMSBYAaronVincentElkaim-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <em>Munduruku people protesting the Tapajos Dams, credit Aaron Vincent Elkaim</em><br /> <br /> During my 2012 fact finding mission, I met with Jose Carlos Arara, leader of the Arara tribe. He said to me:  The government does not tell us the truth or listen to us. They are not complying with the laws of the land and they are not respecting our rights. Our survival is now in the hands of the government and Norte Energia. The Brazilian government is only thinking about profit and growth. The Belo Monte will take away our autonomy and our right to survive. <br /> <br /> I also met with Dr Erwin Kraütler the Bishop of the Xingu. He said to me,  Belo Monte will be an apocalypse for the Amazon. And the Amazon is important for the world climate. It will have consequences not only for Brazil but for the world. I cannot agree -- not only as a bishop, but as a man -- I cannot agree with this decision, which threatens the survival of future generations. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-DOMERWINKRAUTLER.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-DOMERWINKRAUTLER.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-DOMERWINKRAUTLER-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>Bishop Erwin Krautler</em><br /> <br /> The Brazilian government has used the legal mechanism of Security Suspension  or  Suspensão de Segurança,  to allow them to steamroll its own laws and constitution. Citing the dubious rationale of national security, threatening blackouts and energy crises, the government has been allowed to arbitrarily and repeatedly overturn legal rulings that would have paralyzed Belo Monte and several other dam projects which are currently under construction.<br /> <br /> In Brazil on the 9th December 2014 the Proposed Constitutional Amendment 215 (PEC 215) was <a href= http://amazonwatch.org/news/2013/0808-indigenous-rights-under-assault-in-brazil  target= _hplink >debated</a> in parliament. This Amendment If approved, would transfer authority to demarcate lands from the Executive to Legislative branch. The Amendment would prohibit ancestral land demarcations of indigenous territories. If this Amendment goes through, the Ruralista  - a conservative bloc that represents the country's growing agribusiness sector would have the decision making power. The debate has been postponed until next week. If it passes, this is a deeply troubling development.<br /> <br /> <strong>DAMS IN THE AMAZON</strong><br /> <br /> 412 dams are planned across the Amazon rainforest. 256 of them are in Brazil, 77 in Peru, 55 in Ecuador, 14 in Bolivia, six in Venezuela, two in Guyana, and one each in Colombia, French Guyana and Surinam. Five of the six rivers which run through the world's largest tropical forest will be dammed - and damned. All over Brazil, even now, the Amazon's waterways are being blocked and diverted. The river system that provides almost a quarter of the world's fresh water is being dammed, polluted and fouled up. <br /> <br /> The dams being built throughout South America present a threat to millions of indigenous people. In Brazil alone, 80,000 people will be displaced.<br /> <br /> Those who are most affected by these dams are the communities and indigenous people, who live in the surrounding areas. These megadams are threatening their survival, way of life and culture.<br /> <br /> All countries must comply with Article 169 of the International Labour Organization's Convention. It is imperative that indigenous rights, including the right to 'free, prior and informed consent,' are respected. Indigenous peoples' land and territorial rights must be protected in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and with State obligations under related human rights instruments. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand why the Latin American countries where megadams are planned, do not opt for renewable energy instead of building these costly - both economically and in terms of human rights - dams. Everything these governments claim that these megadams will deliver could instead be achieved with renewable energy, which would not have the same devastating impact on this vast, fragile ecosystem. Renewable energy is not merely the solution to Latin America's mounting energy needs: it is the solution to all our needs. Promoting renewable energy must now become a global and universal priority. These technologies are the only viable solution to the imminent energy crisis. Nothing is macro-economically more necessary, more practical or cheaper than the conversion of our energy systems from conventional energies to renewable energy.<br /> <br /> <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER IN THE RAINFOREST</strong><br /> <br /> It's not just megadams which are threatening indigenous people and the Amazon. <br /> <br /> As COP20 drags on inside the military compound which the <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/09/the-amazon-oil-spills-overlooked-by-environmental-leaders-in-lima?CMP=share_btn_tw  target= _hplink >Guardian </a>newspaper refers to as a 'climate fortress,' there are human rights and environmental disasters happening in Peru. The Peruvian government is pursuing expansion of oil and gas operations in the Amazon.<br /> <br /> Over the last few months, as the world was preparing for the COP, the North Peruvian Petroperú oil pipeline, which runs through the Amazon for 850 miles, has broken in five places. The spills have, to quote the Guardian: 'spewed thick black clots of crude across jungle and swamp and carpeted local fishing lagoons with dead fish.' <br /> <br /> Two of the spills are clearly visible from the air: dark scars across the green forest. Indigenous communities nearby report illness in their children; dead fish and the corpses of small animals are clogging up the river. <br /> <br /> Such activities by governments and corporations are egregious human rights violations. They cause irreparable and irreversible damage to the environment and accelerate climate change. Greg Asner of the Carnegie Institution for Science found, in a <a href= http://news.mongabay.com/2014/1110-at-risk-carbon-stocks-in-peru.html#sthash.esOgQkka.dpbs  target= _hplink >report </a>published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that  nearly a billion metric tons of above-ground carbon stocks in Peru are at imminent risk for emission into the atmosphere due to land uses such as fossil fuel oil exploration, cattle ranching, oil palm plantations and gold mining.  <br /> <br /> Resistance to granting indigenous peoples rights to their ancestral land is motivated by profit. Many governments know that beneath indigenous lands lie great reserves of fossil fuels and minerals and they are willing to sacrifice lives and the environment to access them.<br /> <br /> The Peruvian government is not the only one exploring for oil in the Amazon. The Biosphere of<a href= http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2066313/is_this_the_end_of_yasuni_national_park.html  target= _hplink > Yasuni </a>National Park in Ecuador is home to a record number of animal and plant species, not to mention the Tagaeri and Taromenane clans of the Waorani, whose ancestral lands sit atop Ecuador's largest undeveloped oil reserves. 90% of the Ecuadorian population opposes the move to drill, but President Correa insists he has 'no choice.' By<a href= http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0602-hance-yasuni-oil-permits.html#ixzz3LoulJbMD  target= _hplink > 2016</a>, a subsidiary of the national oil company, Petroamazonas will be drilling in Yasuni Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputinin (ITT) block, an untouched swathe of primary rainforest covering around 100,000 hectares. <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/08/ecuador-rejects-petition-oil-drilling-yasuni  target= _hplink >The  Guardian newspaper </a>alleges that Ecuador has negotiated a secret deal with Chinese bank over ITT's oil.<br /> <br /> The BJHRF and I also have been supporting the Mayangna people in their struggle to protect their ancestral land - the Biosphere Reserve of Bosawás in Nicaragua, the second largest rain forest in the western hemisphere, home to approximately 40,000 indigenous Mayangna. Bosawás is part of Nicaragua's national patrimony - a unique preserve of indigenous culture. <br /> <br /> The lives of the Mayangna and Bosawás's unique ecosystems are threatened by invasions of illegal loggers and settlers. The Mayangna leader Charley Taylor was killed on April 24th 2013, trying to defend his lands from loggers, who had cleared 35 acres of precious hardwoods. These invaders have deforested around 150,000 hectares since 2009, are polluting the rivers and threatening the Mayangna people. If these illegal activities are allowed to continue, in ten years Bosawás may no longer exist.<br /> <br /> I have appealed to President Daniel Ortega to declare a state of emergency in Bosawás.<br /> <br /> <strong>WOMEN AND CLIMATE CHANGE</strong><br /> <br /> The Government of Peru announced on December 8th, gender day here at the COP, that Peru will become the first country in South America to incorporate a Climate Change Gender Action Plan into its national climate policy and planning, and the 14th country in the world to do so. This is wonderful news. <br /> <br /> I met some extraordinary and courageous women indigenous leaders when I spoke at the WECAN event, Women on the Frontlines of Climate Change, on December 8th. Patricia Gualinga, the Kichwa leader from Sarayaku, Ecuador, Ruth Buendia, an Asháninka Leader from Peru, Alicia Cahuiya Iteca of the Huaroni, Ecuador, Tantoo Cardinal of the Tar Sands in Canada among many others. These are inspiring women, standing up to defend the rights of future generations, they are unflinching defenders of their people and their ancestral lands. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BJWITHPATRICIAGUALINGAOFTHESARAYAKUINECUADORANDALICIACAHUIYAITECAOFTHEHUAROANIECUADOR8.12.14COP20.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-BJWITHPATRICIAGUALINGAOFTHESARAYAKUINECUADORANDALICIACAHUIYAITECAOFTHEHUAROANIECUADOR8.12.14COP20.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BJWITHPATRICIAGUALINGAOFTHESARAYAKUINECUADORANDALICIACAHUIYAITECAOFTHEHUAROANIECUADOR8.12.14COP20-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>Bianca Jagger with Patricia Gualinga, and Alicia Cahuiya Ateca</em><br /> <br /> Some of them spoke about Pachamama, the goddess of nature and balance who is honoured here in Peru, and across South America You could translate Pachamama as Mother Earth but it's more than that. 'Pacha' means more than  earth  - the word also implies the cosmos, universe, time, space... We can't translate Pachamama literally into English, but perhaps a better attempt would be <a href= https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Pachamama.html  target= _hplink >Mother World</a>.<br /> <br /> I urge the COP to remember Pachamana and her rights. What's at stake is our future, and that of future generations.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately women are underrepresented in UNFCCC negotiations, at all the COPs. The UNFCCC has a terrible track record with gender equality. The term wasn't mentioned in documents until 2007. <br /> <br /> Gender equality isn't mentioned in the ADP text. The Philippines human rights language I mentioned earlier, pushed by Ghana and Mexico, would right this omission.<br /> <br /> 'fair, inclusive, respectful of human rights and particularly rights of indigenous people and women.'<br /> <br /> This language has been ignored, and the only mention of gender is a stated intent to ask the COP to <br /> <br /> <blockquote>'(iv) Provide meaningful and regular opportunities for the effective engagement of experts from Parties, relevant international organizations, civil society, indigenous peoples, women, youth, academic institutions, the private sector, and subnational authorities nominated by their respective countries;'</blockquote><br />  <br /> This is woefully inadequate. Climate change is an issue of gender equality. <br /> <br /> In addition there has been shameful compromise in the Subsidiary Body for Implementation SBI two year work programme to advance gender. The SBI work programme was decided in Warsaw, and was a welcome step forward. <br /> <br /> But this week, in a travesty of cowardly wording, the term  'gender equality' was replaced by 'gender balance' in the <a href= http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2014/sbi/eng/l43rev01.pdf  target= _hplink >text </a>of the SBI decision on the Work Progamme on Gender, at the behest of Saudi Arabia. Gender balance is a purely numerical term. It has nothing to do with equality. Gender equality is mentioned once in the Decision, in a context that negates it. I urge you to read Diego Ortiz's excellent<a href= http://adoptanegotiator.org/how-we-are-losing-the-gender-equality-battle-against-saudi-arabia/  target= _hplink > analysis</a> regarding this on the blog adoptanegotiator. Mexico remained the only country which continued to push for the term 'gender equality' to be used throughout the text. <br /> <br /> This is a fatal step back for gender equality. I am appalled. My only hope is that the COP reopens the topic in Paris. <br /> <br /> I am very concerned.  What would this mean for gender equality at the UN, in the global climate agreement, and for future generations?<br /> <br /> <strong>MOVING FORWARD</strong><br /> <br /> We need to achieve a legally binding global climate treaty at COP21 in Paris next year. Failure is not an option. In order to do so we need to reach an equitable agreement on the INDCs now, and agree a draft text that paves the way. <br /> <br /> It is an example of the bizarre nature of the negotiations at COP20 that, at least this week, the Catholic Church seems to have expressed more progressive views on climate change than most representatives of government here at the UN Climate Conference.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://ncronline.org/blogs/eco-catholic/catholic-bishops-lima-delegates-end-fossil-fuels-tend-vulnerable-climate-deal  target= _hplink >The Obispos Declaration</a>, which was released by 9 Catholic bishops from Peru, Brazil, Dhaka, France and South Africa on December 10th called for new models of development and lifestyle, stating that  central to this is to put an end to the fossil fuel era, phasing out fossil fuel emissions and phasing in 100% renewables with sustainable energy access for all . I couldn't agree more. In fact, I feel vindicated... I have been calling for reform to our model of development and a phasing out of fossil fuels for many years. You can read what I wrote about the UN Conference on Sustainable Development Rio+20<a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bianca-jagger/the-document-adopted-at-r_b_1627736.html  target= _hplink > here</a>... <br /> <br /> As I write, we're still waiting for an outcome, here at COP20. Now and then, above the din of traffic and the chatter you can hear the squawks of parakeets. <br /> <br /> At past COPs pressure from the US and other developed countries to cut proceedings short, decision, or no decision, has resulted in a failure to reach an agreement. This tactic was being employed again at COP20. When US representative Todd Stern spoke this morning he warned of the 'hour glass running out,' that failure to accept the draft text could jeopardise the UNFCCC's status. <br /> <br /> I hope for once the countries can have the courage of their convictions and emerge from COP20 with a concrete outcome. I hope the delegates don't let schedules and timekeeping become the determining factor, once again. Unfortunately I have witnessed the failure of the COPs too often to hold out much hope. Let's hope that Paris brings the change we need. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 10:40:32 -0500"	"politics"
"Texas Weighs Allowing Open Carry Of Handguns"	"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Long depicted as the rootin'-tootin' capital of American gun culture, Texas is one of the few states with an outright ban on the open carry of handguns.<br /> <br /> That could change in 2015, with the Republican-dominated Legislature and Gov.-elect Greg Abbott expected to push for expanded gun rights.  If open carry is good enough for Massachusetts, it's good enough for the state of Texas,  Abbott said the day after his election last month.<br /> <br /> And if Texas, which allows concealed handguns, embraces open carry — rolling back a 140-year ban — it would be the largest state to have done so.<br /> <br /> Open carry drew wide support in the 2014 statewide election, and at least six bills have already been filed for the upcoming session, which starts in January. Abbott has already pledged to sign one into law if sent to his desk.<br /> <br /> Coni Ross, a 63-year-old rancher in Blanco, carries a handgun in her purse for personal protection and said she'd like the option to carry it openly on her belt if she could. She already does when she's on her ranch and feels comfortable with her gun by her side.<br /> <br />  In one-and-a-half seconds, a man can run 25 feet with a knife in his hands and stab you before you get your gun out,  Ross said.  If your weapon is concealed you're dead. <br /> <br /> Most of the country already allows some form of open carry of handguns, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a California-based group advocating gun control legislation.<br /> <br /> But Texas, California, Florida, New York, Illinois and South Carolina, which make up more than a third of the U.S. population and include six of its seven largest population centers, do not.<br /> <br /> Large urban areas have traditionally had the strictest controls on weapons in public because of concerns over guns in crowds and crime control, said UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, author of  Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.  He said it's  pretty surprising  that Texas still has an open carry ban that dates to the 1870s.<br /> <br />  We've been regulating guns in the interest of public safety, even in places like Texas, since the founding,  Winkler said.  The battle over open carry of guns in public remains one of the most heated in the gun debate today. <br /> <br /> Of the states that ban open carry, Texas easily has the most gun-friendly reputation.<br /> <br /> From manufacturers to dealers, Texas has the most federal firearms license holders in the country. It has few restrictions on gun ownership, and Gov. Rick Perry and state lawmakers have actively lobbied gun makers to move to the state.<br /> <br /> Texas allows the public display of long guns, such as rifles and shotguns, and open carry advocates have staged high-profile rallies at the Alamo and state Capitol. Concealed handguns are allowed inside the Capitol, where license holders can bypass metal detectors.<br /> <br /> But Texas still insists handguns be kept out of sight.<br /> <br /> Texas first banned the carrying of handguns  when the carpet-bagger government was very anxious about former Confederates and recently freed slaves carrying firearms,  state Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said.<br /> <br /> Overturning a century of law proved difficult, and a concealed weapons law failed several times until it finally passed in 1995 when Patterson, then a state senator, led the charge. Texas now has about 811,000 concealed handgun license holders, nearly equal the population of San Francisco.<br /> <br /> Even among gun supporters in Texas, the idea of open carry was considered too radical when the concealed carry law passed. Since then, the Legislature has expanded gun rights incrementally. It made the licensing of concealed handguns easier and, during the last three sessions, held heated debates over concealed handguns on college campuses. Open carry backers believe these debates helped rally support to their cause and that an open carry law will pass.<br /> <br /> Open carry opponents, such as Moms Demand Action for Gun Safety in America, say carrying guns on the street is less about gun rights than intimidation.<br /> <br />  There is no way to know ... if that person is a threat to moms and our children,  said Claire Elizabeth, who heads the group's Texas chapter.<br /> <br /> Despite the early momentum, there are no guarantees open carry will pass. Bills to allow concealed handguns on college campus appeared to have widespread support in 2009, 2011 and 2013, but were derailed by objections from universities and law enforcement.<br /> <br /> Most of the open carry bills already filed for the upcoming session would still require a license. One, by Rep. Joe Stickland, R-Bedford, would eliminate the licensing requirement for concealed or open carry.<br /> <br />  The idea is we're going to return our Second Amendment rights,  Stickland said.  I can't imagine what the citizens would do if they had to take a class or pay a fee to use their First Amendment rights. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 10:38:36 -0500"	"politics"
"Jeb Bush Still Mulling 2016 Presidential Bid"	"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Jeb Bush's big donors and allies are tantalized by his promise to decide  in short order  whether to run for president.<br /> <br /> But supporters are struggling to understand what his actions mean and whether they can predict his political intentions. Bush is scheduled to give the commencement address Monday at the University of South Carolina during his second visit in recent months to the state that's set to host the South's first presidential primary.<br /> <br /> On the eve of the appearance, he said he plans to release an electronic book early next year along with roughly 250,000 thousands of emails from his time as governor.<br /> <br /> Surely, that's a sign the former Florida governor is in.<br /> <br /> Bush also is expanding his private equity business, and advisers insist he's not courting a political staff Iowa and New Hampshire, even as other would-be candidates assemble their 2016 campaign teams in the early voting states.<br /> <br /> Surely, that's a sign he's out.<br /> <br /> About all anyone can say for certain is that, as Bush himself has said, he's still thinking about it.<br /> <br />  He's begun the journey. How long it will take him, I don't know,  said Al Cardenas, a longtime Bush friend and former chairman of the American Conservative Union.  People are interpreting activity to conclude that he's closer to running. I'm not of that school.<br /> <br />  I hope he runs, but I believe the activity is based on getting serious. <br /> <br /> Bush has said he expects to make a decision by the end of the month.<br /> <br /> As the son of one president and brother of another, he has the power to transform the 2016 contest like no other Republican. He can tap into his family's vast political network, and his campaign would attract strong support from major donors and widespread media attention.<br /> <br /> Bush spent much of the recent midterm campaign out of the public eye. But the address at South Carolina will be his fourth high-profile speech in recent weeks. That includes an appearance before corporate executives in Washington, where he called for his party to embrace an immigration overhaul and to focus on governing. He also said would make the call on running for president  not that far out in the future. <br /> <br /> In an interview with ABC's Miami affiliate WPLG-TV, Bush said he was in the process of writing an e-book about his time as governor and that it would come out in the spring. At about the same time, he will make public about 250,000 emails from his time in office, in an effort to promote transparency and to  let people make up their mind. <br /> <br /> Bush said going through the material has reminded him that  if you run with big ideas and then you're true to those ideas, and get a chance to serve and implement them and do it with passion and conviction, you can move the needle. ... And that's what we need right now in America,  he said in the interview set to air Sunday.<br /> <br /> Slater Bayliss, a longtime Florida-based Bush aide who helps lead a political action committee founded by Bush's sons, met with strategists in Iowa during a late November trip to his native state.<br /> <br /> Former Iowa Republican Party Chairman Chuck Larson was among those who discussed with Bayliss the state's political trends, policy issues and how the state might react to a Bush campaign.<br /> <br />  If Jeb Bush decides to run for president, I believe he will be incredibly well received by conservatives in Iowa,  Larson said.<br /> <br /> Bush's spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, like other advisers, said the meetings were unauthorized and unrelated to his decision-making.<br /> <br /> She said Bush  has not yet made a decision on whether he will pursue a run in 2016, and has certainly not dispatched anyone to meet with Iowa leaders,  Campbell said.<br /> <br /> The same week Bayliss met with Iowa Republicans, Bush was named chairman and manager of a new private equity fund, BH Global Aviation. As first reported by Bloomberg, the offshore fund raised $61 million in September.<br /> <br /> Bush's team described the investment as an expansion of an existing, and previously reported, private business, which he would review should he run. Most recent presidential candidates, including private equity investor Mitt Romney, formally cut ties with their business interests years before running.<br /> <br /> Bush  is very proud of his investment work to grow companies,  Campbell said, adding that there is no part of his business interests  that would hinder a run for president if that is the decision he makes. <br /> <br /> There is no shortage of pressure on Bush to get into the race, including from members of his family. His older brother, former President George W. Bush, has encouraged his brother to enter the 2016 contest.<br /> <br />  He knows I want him to run,  Bush told CNN recently.  If I need to reiterate it, I will: 'Run, Jeb.' I think he'd be a great president. <br /> <br /> Still, associates say that the family support and a growing public profile should not necessarily be taken as a sign of anything.<br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Peoples reported from Washington.

Before the war, Germany had expressed broad ambitions to develop an African empire. In 1914, Germany controlled four principal colonies in Africa: German West Africa, Togoland, German East Africa and German Southwest Africa. Together, these colonies covered an area of approximately one million square miles and had a population of almost fifteen million people. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-Mittelafrika2.png ><img alt= 2014-12-14-Mittelafrika2.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-Mittelafrika2-thumb.png  width= 570  height= 517  /></a><br /> German Colonial Ambitions in Africa<br /> Dark Blue Indicates Existing Colonies<br /> Light Blue Shows Proposed Expansion<br /> <br /> <br /> The <em>Mittleafrika</em> lobby had advocated the annexation or the acquisition of both the Belgian Congo and the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique as well as the British colonies of Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Nyasaland (Malawi) and Northern Rhodesia (Zambia). Additional British and French territory would also have  been acquired had Germany triumphed in the war. The result would have been the creation of a German colonial empire from the Guinea coast to the Indian Ocean covering one-third of the continent. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-02-b28c5a507e74c48c5f571c79553a8381.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-02-b28c5a507e74c48c5f571c79553a8381.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-02-b28c5a507e74c48c5f571c79553a8381-thumb.jpg  width= 428  height= 570  /></a><br /> British African Cavalry (Ponies Painted to Look Like Zebras)<br /> <br /> Instead, German colonies, mostly lightly defended, were subject to campaigns by armies of the British Empire, France, Belgium and Portugal. Germany's African empire, by the end of the war, was dismantled, with the victors dividing the spoils between them.<br /> <br /> German colonial troops in the West African country of Togoland, nowadays Togo, and the Volta region of Ghana, surrendered to British and French forces very early in the war. In Kamerun, modern-day Cameroon, the fighting continued until 1916. Many German soldiers eventually escaped into the neutral territory of Spanish Guinea.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-02-Britishgunsin20GermanEastAfrica.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-02-Britishgunsin20GermanEastAfrica.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-02-Britishgunsin20GermanEastAfrica-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 223  /></a><br /> British Artillery Unit in German East Africa<br /> <br /> In their attempt to take German Southwest Africa, today's Namibia, the British committed the error of arming their former enemies, the Boers of South Africa. They paid the price when 12,000 Boers rebelled. Once the rebels had been vanquished, Boer General Jan Smuts advanced on the capital, Windhoek, and succeeded in capturing it in May 1915. South Africa was to remain effective ruler of southwest Africa for the next 75 years.<br /> <br /> German and Portuguese forces clashed on the border between German Southwest Africa and Angola in March 1915. Despite their early success, the Germans surrendered in July. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-02-140808111044ww1inafricadaressalaamtroopshorizontalgallery.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-02-140808111044ww1inafricadaressalaamtroopshorizontalgallery.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-02-140808111044ww1inafricadaressalaamtroopshorizontalgallery-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 320  /></a><br /> German African Troops, <em>Schutztruppen</em>, in Dar es Salaam<br /> <br /> It was a different story in German East Africa, where the German colony comprised the modern-day states of Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda.

Here, in a sustained guerrilla campaign led by the German General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, a force of approximately 14,000 men, including 11,000 African soldiers held the combined, 300,000-strong, armies of Britain, Belgium and Portugal at bay for four years.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-02-Bundesarchiv_B_145_BildP008268_General_Paul_von_LettowVorbeck.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-02-Bundesarchiv_B_145_BildP008268_General_Paul_von_LettowVorbeck.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-02-Bundesarchiv_B_145_BildP008268_General_Paul_von_LettowVorbeck-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 395  /></a><br /> General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck on Parade in Berlin 1919<br /> <br /> By 1916, the British, tired of the hit-and-run tactics, had handed command to Smuts.

While his actions had little influence on the overall outcome of the war, he returned to Germany a national hero. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 09:55:22 -0500"	"politics"
"Congress Passes Historic Medical Marijuana Protections In Spending Bill"	"Congress dealt a historic blow to the United States' decades-long war on drugs Saturday with the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/13/cromnibus-senate_n_6321144.html  target= _hplink >passage of the federal spending bill</a>, which contains protections for medical marijuana and industrial hemp operations in states where they are legal.<br /> <br /> The spending bill includes an amendment that prohibits the Department of Justice from using funds to go after state-legal medical cannabis programs. If the bill is signed into law, it will bring the federal government one step closer to ending raids on medical marijuana dispensaries, as well as stopping arrests of individuals involved with pot businesses that are complying with state law.<br /> <br /> “When the House first passed this measure back in May, we made headlines; today we made history,  Rep. Sam Farr (D-Calif.), who in May introduced the medical marijuana protections amendment with co-sponsor Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), told The Huffington Post regarding the bill's passage. <br /> <br />  The federal government will finally respect the decisions made by the majority of states that passed medical marijuana laws,  Farr added.  This is great day for common sense because now our federal dollars will be spent more wisely on prosecuting criminals and not sick patients.” <br /> <br /> The bill protects medical marijuana programs in the 23 states that have legalized marijuana for medical purposes, as well as 11 additional states that have legalized CBD oils, a non-psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that has shown to be beneficial in some <a href= http://www.medicalmarijuanainc.com/index.php/investor-relations/57-latest-news/291-cbd-approved-for-epilepsy-research  target= _hplink >severe cases of epilepsy</a>.<br /> <br /> “Congress has finally initiated a drawdown in the federal government’s war on medical marijuana,” said Mason Tvert, director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project, in a statement. “This legislation makes it clear that the DEA has no business interfering in states’ medical marijuana laws. Taxpayer money should not be used to punish seriously ill people who use medical marijuana and the caregivers who provide it to them.”<br /> <br /> Under the Obama administration, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/26/obamas-drug-war-medical-marijuana_n_2546178.html  target= _hplink >the DEA and several U.S. attorneys</a> have raided marijuana dispensaries and sent people to prison, even though they complied with state laws. According to a report released last year by advocacy group Americans for Safe Access, the Obama administration has spent nearly $80 million each year cracking down on medical marijuana, which amounts to more than $200,000 per day.<br /> <br /> Under the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I substance with  no currently accepted medical use,  alongside heroin and LSD. Since that doesn't change with the passage of the omnibus package, it's not entirely clear how the protections will work in practice.<br /> <br />  This isn't finely written policy yet,  Farr said in June after the amendment first passed in the House, <a href= http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobsullum/2014/06/03/would-the-rohrabacher-farr-amendment-actually-stop-medical-marijuana-raids/  target= _hplink >Forbes' Jacob Sullum reported</a>. “This is a statement of congressional intent that [the] DEA [should] back off on these issues. We will have to continue to reconcile federal policy with state policy.”<br /> <br /> A statement issued by Americans for Safe Access following the spending bill's passage Saturday called the measure  historic  and said patients' rights advocates believe it  will dramatically impact DOJ enforcement, including ending federal medical marijuana raids, arrests, criminal prosecutions, and civil asset forfeiture lawsuits. <br /> <br /> Industrial hemp also received new protections from DEA intervention under the spending bill. The same plant species as marijuana, cannabis sativa, hemp contains little to no THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana associated with the  high  sensation. The farm bill, which President Barack Obama signed into law in February, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-/obama-marijuana-legalization_b_4768009.html  target= _hplink >legalized industrial hemp production</a> in states that permit it. <br /> <br /> Eighteen states have legalized industrial hemp production, and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/01/hemp-bills-us_n_5064741.html  target= _hplink >more than a dozen others</a> have introduced legislation that would authorize research into the plant, set up a regulatory framework or legalize growing it.<br /> <br /> Earlier this year, the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/13/dea-seizes-kentuckys-hemp_n_5318098.html  target= _hplink >DEA made headlines when it seized hemp seeds</a> intended to be used in the launch of Kentucky's legal hemp research pilot program. A month later, the hemp seeds were released, and the state began planting its research crop. <br /> <br /> It wasn't all victories for marijuana in the spending bill -- the legalization of recreational marijuana in Washington, D.C., which nearly 70 percent of voters approved, appears to be <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/omnibus-marijuana-_n_6301600.html?1418225607  target= _hplink >blocked</a>. However, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/12/pelosi-dc-marijuana_n_6316762.html  target= _hplink >several members of Congress</a> have taken issue with the language used in bill, arguing that law may still be able to move forward.

"Russia Denies One Of Its Military Planes Nearly Collided With A Passenger Jet"	"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's Defense Ministry on Sunday denied Swedish claims that for the second time this year a Russian military aircraft had nearly collided with a passenger jet over Sweden, insisting that the two planes were never less than 70 kilometers (42 miles) apart.<br /> <br /> Scandinavian Airlines, which was operating the commercial flight, also said the incident had been blown out of proportion and that no danger had been posed to Friday's flight from Copenhagen to Poznan, Poland. Swedish military officials raised the alarm on Saturday by announcing that the Russian intelligence plane, which had turned off its transponders to avoid commercial radar, had come dangerously close to colliding with the passenger jet.<br /> <br />  This is serious. This is inappropriate. This is outright dangerous when you turn off the transponder,  Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said on Swedish radio.<br /> <br /> Russia responded on Sunday by insisting that its military aircraft had been operating in compliance with rules governing international airspace and flying at a safe distance from routes used by civilian flights.<br /> <br />  There were no prerequisites for an air accident,  Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.<br /> <br /> SAS also said the Russian aircraft had maintained a safe distance.<br /> <br />  This has been blown out of all proportion, completely,  SAS spokesman Knut Morten Johansen said.  It wasn't even an incident.  He said there was no breach  because the safety distance between aircraft hadn't been exceeded. <br /> <br /> Sweden's air force chief, Maj. Gen. Micael Byden, said Saturday that the incident in international air space looked  pretty serious  and the commercial flight was immediately ordered to change course, but he said it was not as serious as in March when a Russian plane flying without transponders came within 100 meters (300 feet) of another SAS plane that had taken off from Copenhagen.<br /> <br /> Russia has increased its military presence in the Baltic Sea area as tensions with the West have risen over the conflict in Ukraine. NATO also has air patrols over the Baltic Sea and rotates NATO military units in and out of member countries in the region.<br /> <br /> Konashenkov said the number of flights by NATO warplanes along Russia's borders has tripled in recent months, and a NATO reconnaissance plane was flying between the Russian aircraft and the passenger jet on Friday. NATO aircraft also fly in international air space with their transponders switched off, he said.<br /> <br /> Carl Bildt, the former Swedish foreign minister, said this practice should be changed.  Should we seek an agreement for all military planes in international air in Baltic area to use transponders? For transparency and safety,  he wrote in a Twitter post.<br /> <br /> -----<br /> <br /> Matti Huuhtanen in Helsinki, Finland, contributed to this report."

"Angry Afghan President Vows Security Shake-Up After Taliban Attacks Surge"	"<br>By Frank Jack Daniel and Hamid Shalizi</br>                <br>KABUL, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Afghanistan's new President Ashraf  Ghani vowed to shake up security in the capital Kabul in an  angry speech on Sunday and denounced a recent surge in Taliban  attacks on civilian and military targets as  un-Islamic. </br>                <br>In recent weeks, Afghanistan has seen waves of suicide  bombings and commando-style assaults by the Islamist insurgents,  who are seeking to make territorial gains and to spread  uncertainty as most foreign troops withdraw this month.</br>                <br> It is enough and it's no longer acceptable,  Ghani yelled  while on a visit to a school. He called on religious leaders to  speak out against the Taliban.</br>                <br> These acts are not Islamic and are inhuman,  he said.</br>                <br>The Taliban's increasingly bold attacks in Kabul have led  to the government being criticized for serious security  failures.</br>                <br>Ghani said he was seeking to revive a security body last  seen during a Soviet-backed government in the 1980s. He did not  give more details, but his spokesman said the new body would  coordinate between police, military and intelligence agencies.</br>                <br> The number of forces we have in Kabul is sufficient, but  the way they are being used is a problem, we have to change  that,  spokesman Nazifullah Salarzai said after the event.</br>                <br>Kabul houses thousands of soldiers and police armed with  light and heavy weapons. It is fortified with razor wire-topped  concrete blast walls and dotted with checkpoints. But this does  not seem to have curbed the Taliban's confidence.</br>                <br>On Thursday, a suicide bombing at a French cultural center  guarded by the army in central Kabul killed a German man, who  was attending a performance of a play denouncing suicide bombs.</br>                <br>When two Kabul guest houses used by foreigners were targeted  within days of each other last month, the Kabul police chief  lost his position, although the official reason for his  dismissal remains unclear.</br>                <br/>                <br> FRAGILE SECURITY </br>                <br>In the past two days, Taliban fighters shot dead a dozen  workers removing landmines in the south of the country, killed  seven soldiers and blew up a military convoy, killing two U.S.  soldiers near Bagram Airfield, north of the capital.</br>                <br>On a trip to northern Afghanistan on Saturday, German  defense minister Ursula von der Leyen described the security  situation as  fragile. </br>                <br>Ghani has yet to announce a cabinet two months after he took  office in a power-sharing agreement with his main rival,  Abdullah Abdullah, a situation critics say has left the country  adrift while the Taliban are cranking up violence.</br>                <br>Salarzai said the president devoted a third of his time to  security and that, in the long run, the slow selection of  officials would assure good governance in a country plagued by  political corruption.</br>                <br>He added that the government was committed to naming the  cabinet within the next two weeks.</br>                <br>Officials say the delay in selecting ministers is the result  of Ghani's power tussle with Abdullah, who joined the government  after a disputed election.

"What Happened to Romania's Irrecuperables?"	"In 1990, the issue that catapulted Romania into the headlines in the West, after the rise and fall of Ceausescu, was the country's orphanages. Journalists and foreign health care workers were appalled to discover the condition of babies and children in the many state-run institutions in the country. During the Ceausescu era, abortions were difficult to obtain, and many families were simply too poor to handle another mouth to feed. The 700 orphanages scattered around the country were filled to bursting with 170,000 children.<br /> <br /> Many of the children were healthy. Adoption agencies began to match children to eager parents abroad. In that first year, Romania sent 10,000 children abroad, and tens of thousands more before the Romanian government, citing corruption, imposed a moratorium in 2001.<br /> <br /> But there were also many children that didn't fit the profile that most adoptive parents wanted. These were the  irrecuperables,  the children with mental and physical disabilities who were warehoused in  hospitals.  Romanian authorities, both during and immediately after the Ceausescu era, had deemed these children beyond recuperation.<br /> <br /> In 1990, I tracked down one of these  hospitals  in the tiny village of Gradinari, about 20 kilometers outside of Bucharest. It was a sobering experience.  Since the weather was nice, the children were outside, in the backyard of a large institutional-looking building,  I wrote at the time (the report is reproduced below).  There were over 100. The supervisor explained: 120 children and only 2 nurses. There were two long picnic tables crowded with children. A group of pens were set up underneath a tent. Several older children stood off to one side. One child, with only one leg, ambled around using his arm as a second leg. All the children were filthy, some with cuts, some only half-clothed. The children in the pens, their heads shaved, rolled around in their soiled diapers, some malnourished to the point of apparent starvation. The mixture of disabilities was staggering: Downs syndrome, autism, amputees, physical birth defects and so on. <br /> <br /> On returning to Romania in 2013, I planned to go back to Gradinari to see what happened to the irrecuperables. It turned out, however, that I needed to apply for permission beforehand, and I ran out of time to get the necessary paperwork.<br /> <br /> I did, however, have a chance to interview Bogdan Bobolea. He works with the Irish charity Comber which focuses on children and adults with disabilities in Giurgiu County, where Gradinari is located. A quarter century after the fall of Ceausescu, there are still many institutions and orphanages throughout Romania. Comber is working to close them down and build homes in the community for the residents. They've built two residential homes in Gradinari for 16 people. In the much larger Giurgiu city, they run two houses and four apartments, along with a day center that organizes activities.<br /> <br /> Several recent news accounts have reported on the persistence of dreadful conditions in the remaining orphanages and institutions. The BBC made a secret film of its visit to several places in Giurgiu County, and this had prompted the government to institute its new permitting procedure.<br /> <br /> Bobolea thought the BBC report one-sided.  We have improved, not much perhaps, but compared with what was in 1990, I think we've progressed a lot,  he told me in Bucharest in May 2013. In terms of the institutions that haven't yet been closed down,  the buildings are better. The sanitary conditions are better. There are clothes. There are cleaning staff. The food is okay. What is missing is the specialized staff. <br /> <br /> The institution that I visited in Gradinari, for instance, has been shut down. The children, now grown up, have been moved to other facilities. As Bobolea explained, children with disabilities have several options when they turn 18.  As soon as they reach 18, they have four options,  he told me.  They can go to a big institution. They can go to an NGO if there are spots open in the residential facilities. They can go back to their families. Or they can go to a foster family. <br /> <br /> The reality is a bit starker for most of these children, however. Foster families prefer children without disabilities. The original families are often reluctant to take on the challenge. And there are not many spots open in the residential facilities.<br /> <br />  The only available spot is when someone is taken home,  Bobolea said.  But nobody is taken home. What we're doing now in Giurgiu is to put a couple beds in an office to house two persons. Or we're adding a fifth person to an apartment and that person will stay in the living room. It's better to use the available space if it's possible. But we cannot put more than five in an apartment. <br /> <br /> The worst situation is when a child with disabilities has been living in a residential setting, turns 18, and there's no spot available in any of the houses or apartments for adults. They face the possibility of returning to one of the remaining large-scale institutions and losing the progress they'd made in the more supportive environment.<br /> <br /> The EU has declared it a priority to close the orphanages and large-scale institutions. But it has not made sufficient funds available to build the houses and apartments that can serve as replacements.<br /> <br /> I asked Bobolea how long it would take, if the EU funds were available, to close all the institutions.<br />  If the money is here on the table, it would take 10 years, maybe less,  he replied.  We would have to build the houses. It takes one year of construction, and then you have to train the staff...maybe ten years. But without the money: indefinitely. <br /> <br /> <strong>The Interview</strong><br /> <br /> <em>You were explaining what's happened since I was here last and why it requires a permission to visit Gradinari.</em><br />  <br /> I spoke with the deputy manager, and she said in order to have access you have to send an official request. But it's possible. It means that you can visit, but you need to sign a document that say that you won't use hidden camera, that you have a translator/interpreter.<br /> <br /> Two or three years ago, a BBC crew, using a hidden camera, took some photos and actually recorded a video in Gradinari. It appeared in a movie broadcast on BBC. What they showed was true, but they didn't show the other side, the good things that have happened since 1990. They didn't speak with Comber or with the DGASPC [General Directorate for Social Assistance and Protection], because in that case it would have been a balanced documentary. We have improved, not much perhaps, but compared with what was in 1990, I think we've progressed a lot.<br />  <br /> <em>Why did they have to bring a hidden camera?</em><br />  <br /> I don't know. You see now what's happening in the UK, with Bulgarians and Romanians there. Probably someone wanted a huge headline in the newspaper or on TV about what's happening here.<br />  <br /> <em>I'm interested how you became involved in this work.</em><br />  <br /> Three or four years ago, when I was working in England, Comber had an advertisement in Romania for a project coordinator. One of my friends read that advert and sent it to me. I applied, and I had a phone interview with Fiona Dowling, who was the director at that time. Then we had a meeting in Dublin outside the airport. And then they hired me.<br /> <br /> I came here at that time with another colleague who started work for Comber two or three years before I started. He showed me around. I visited all the institutions, and that was the start. I was involved at the beginning in the supervising of the building of a house in Izvoarele. We're still trying to open it. Then with this project over the summer, we had professionals, students, fresh graduates, or people with a lot of experience in fields like social work, social care, and psychology. They came here for four or five weeks and stayed in Giurgiu. We had many interpreters, high school students, who worked with the Romanian staff in our homes and apartments. This project ran for three years. This year we don't have any candidates. With trainings for the staff we opened a center with another NGO from Bucharest, and I also was involved in that. So basically, I was supervising the building of various structures, recruiting volunteers, and involved in this center.<br />  <br /> <em>Before you took the job, did you know very much about the situation here for children with disabilities?</em><br />  <br /> For children, yes, because before that I worked only with children. So I knew about SERA from France. They closed two or three huge institutes in Bacau. There were children with physical disabilities and mental health associated with this. But regarding the adults, I am ashamed to say but I didn't know much about it.<br />  <br /> <em>Tell me a little bit about what happened since 1990 in terms of for the facility for children at Gradinari as part of the larger change.</em><br />  <br /> What I know is that it was closed. It was refurbished, enlarged, and then it was closed. They were moved to Tantava. Some of them were sent to Bolintin. When I came here it was all shut down, so I don't know much about that. I saw the empty building, I was there several times, and I tried to imagine how it was at that time.<br />  <br /> <em>It was a big, big building. A lot of kids. And my understanding at the time was that there were one or two of those facilities in each county in Romania.</em><br />  <br /> Maybe two or three. Still now there are many. If you have access to the national database, you can see there are at least two in each county, more than 50, 60, maybe 100. But, again, it's better to check again to have real figures.<br />  <br /> <em>Some have been shut down, but -</em><br />  <br /> Most are still open. There was pressure from the EU to close the orphanages. And we invested a lot of money doing that. But regarding adults, even the EU Structural Funds (ESF) allocated money only to refurbish the old buildings or renovate them. We're building something nearby. But they didn't allocate money to build small residential care homes. So because it wasn't eligible for an NGO to apply to build two or three houses, Comber couldn't apply.<br /> <br /> I was at a meeting in Bucharest two or three years ago. It was a huge table, and almost all the managers from religious charities were there, as well as someone from the financial ministry.<br /> <br /> We asked, What can you do? <br /> <br /> And this Romanian from the finance ministry, who also was the president of the body coordinating all the ESF funds in Romania, said,  The code is not written, and we cannot give you the money to refurbish or to build new small houses. <br />  <br /> <em>They knew that they couldn't get the money from the EU, and therefore they couldn't provide the money.</em><br />  <br /> Yes, because it's not eligible. There are people putting pressure to change that, but I don't know what will happen. We'll see when they will launch a new line of finance.<br />  <br /> <em>Let's go back to the EU pressure to close the orphanages. They provided money...</em><br /> <br /> To read the rest of the interview, <a href= http://www.johnfeffer.com/what-happened-to-romanias-irrecuperables/  target= _hplink >click here</a>.

"At the Heart of COP20: Loss and Damage"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BJAndministryofdefencestatuescop20.jpeg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-BJAndministryofdefencestatuescop20.jpeg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BJAndministryofdefencestatuescop20-thumb.jpeg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>Bianca Jagger at COP20, at the Ministry of Defence, Lima Peru</em><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am writing from Lima, Peru, where the 20th Conference of Parties (COP) for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was supposed to be coming to a close... there has been wrangling all night, the closing plenary of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) has finished without a concrete result. The COP President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal was meeting with countries and country blocs to see if agreement can be reached before decision-makers return home.<br /> <br /> The name of the outcome document that will result at Lima has been discussed. In the past we have had the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Accord, the Cancun Agreement, the Durban Platform and the Warsaw Framework. The name 'Lima Action Platform is being suggested, or LAP.' 'LAP' may end up standing for 'Lack of Action and Progress.'<br /> <br /> Over the past thirteen days world leaders and representatives from 195 countries, members of the business community, academics, NGOs, indigenous and grassroots organisations, a total of over 12,000 international visitors have descended on Lima. <br /> <br /> The aim of COP20 was to establish what each country's 'contributions' in the fight against climate change should look like. These 'Intended nationally-determined contributions', (INDCs in UN parlance), should form the basis of the global climate agreement that is expected to be finalized at Paris in 2015 at COP21. <br /> <br /> I have not been optimistic about the outcome of COP20 from the start. I fear this UN climate conference will go down in history as the COP which failed to make provision for the poorest and most vulnerable, that failed to protect the rights of indigenous people and local communities; that postponed REDD+ negotiations, and failed to promote gender equality.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-REDDSIDEEVENTCOP20.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-REDDSIDEEVENTCOP20.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-REDDSIDEEVENTCOP20-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>Bianca Jagger speaking at COP20</em><br /> <br /> <strong>COP</strong><br /> <br /> Oddly, the COP takes place in the Ministry of Defence, referred to by Peruvians as the 'Pentagonito,' meaning 'little pentagon.' It's a sprawling military barracks, with old army training equipment scattered across the grounds. A labyrinthine village of vast temporary buildings and tents has been put up, comprising 30 conference rooms and two plenaries for 2,000 people. The enormous windowless concrete Ministry looms over the whole. As I remarked to a colleague, somehow the site reminds me of Bosnia in the 1990s...<br /> <br /> There is hardly any provision for disabled people at the COP and woeful provision for those who, like me, have an injury. There were no lifts that I could see, and getting from place to place involved long walks in the heat. I walk with a stick. I found negotiating the COP difficult, so I can only imagine the challenge it presents for those who are disabled.<br /> <br /> Most of the events relating to indigenous communities took place at the Maloca, the Indigenous Pavilion, which was in the 'Jockey Club,' a horse racing track about a mile from the main COP. The Maloca was the only area I visited that was deprived of wifi - a tool crucial for networking, negotiating and decision-making. Getting to and from the Pavilion for indigenous events was not easy. There were no buses from the Maloca to participants hotels - we had to return to the Pentagonito and take a bus from there. <br /> <br /> Indigenous people are present in force at COP20 but tragically their voices are not being heard.<br /> <br /> <strong>ADP DRAFT DECISION TEXT</strong><br /> <br /> At about 2 am this morning, Lima, Peru time, a new draft text of the ADP was issued that could form the basis of an agreement in Paris. The decision text is fatally weak, does not respect the principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, is vague on financing, unbalanced, and overly focused on mitigation. The concept of differentiated responsibility is being diluted by new terms. Language relating to 'loss and damage' which is critical for developing countries has been removed. In short it is a poor basis for an agreement in Paris.<br /> <br /> All these shortcomings will affect developing countries and poor communities in disastrous ways. <br /> <br /> At 10.40 am this morning, the closing Plenary began, where countries responded to the text. Some including Malaysia, Sudan, Tuvalu, China, Cuba, Oman, Pakistan, my native Nicaragua and South Africa among others objected to the text, and refuse to accept the agreement as it stands. These countries called for negotiations on the text of the agreement to continue directly under the Peruvian COP President Manuel Pulgar Vidal. <br /> <br /> Ian Fry of Tuvalu, speaking for the Least Developed Countries, stated: 'This text needs a little surgery. We'd like to put on gowns and scalpels and insert some vital organs.' He also stated, 'Loss and damage is a crucial issue for the poorest and most vulnerable.'<br /> <br /> I was very surprised that after eloquently lamenting the loss and damage language, the Philippines agreed to accept the draft ADP text as it stands.<br /> <br /> Singapore described a lack of trust: the draft text is deviating from the Convention, there's backsliding on finance and commitments from developed countries. <br /> <br /> The Malaysian representative Prof. Gurdial Singh Nijar said, 'If you look at who is clapping in this room, and when, you realise we come from different worlds. Many of you colonised us. We started out at different points... The ADP process in Lima has been exhausted... This process was not given a chance until it was too late. This is unlikely to produce an outcome. You must recognise that there is a world out there, a disenfranchised world that is different to your world.'<br /> <br /> Nicaragua's representative Jaime Hermida Castillo said, 'the divisions over the draft agreement are a reflection of our world... We feel climate change right now, although we didn't create it. But we don't have the same resources to deal with it.' <br /> <br /> India echoed these sentiments, stating, 'Let us not forget the billions of poor. Let's not make the poor pay for this, but the polluters.'<br /> <br /> The ADP draft text has now been passed to the COP for further revision, under the supervision of President Pulgar-Vidal. The aim is to achieve a consensus today. He meets all blocs for 10 minutes each. He stated this morning, 'This is not a moment for proposals but for solutions. Let's work together.' We'll see. <br /> <br /> Human rights are not mentioned in the ADP. It is both inexplicable and unconscionable that the <a href= http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/IEEnvironment/Pages/IEenvironmentIndex.aspx  target= _hplink >concept </a>of human rights has been omitted from the draft text. 'A safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment is integral to the full enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to life, health, food, water and sanitation.' Climate change, and the harms it will cause, are fundamentally issues of human rights. <br /> <br /> The Philippines had proposed that the following language be added to the ADP: 'fair, inclusive, respectful of human rights and particularly rights of indigenous people and women.' <br /> <br /> Ghana and Mexico supported the addition of human rights language. Unfortunately I fear, there is now very little chance they will prevail. I cannot fathom why more countries did not support the addition of this language to the ADP. <br /> <br /> On the 10th of December - International Human Rights Day - the Special Procedures Mandate Holders, the largest body of independent experts in the United Nations Human Rights system, issued a <a href= http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15393&LangID=E  target= _hplink >statement </a>urging Member States to integrate human rights standards and principles in the climate negotiations. <br /> <br /> It's critical, their statement continues, since 'impacts of climate change interfere with the effective enjoyment of human rights. In particular, climate change has a disproportionate effect on many disadvantaged, marginalized, excluded and vulnerable individuals and groups, including those whose ways of life are inextricably linked to the environment.' (my italics). <br /> <br /> It seems they were not heeded. In the language of the Advanced Durban Platform decision text it appears that preambular language referencing  human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples  has been removed.  <br /> <br /> <strong>COP PROCESS, HISTORY</strong><br /> <br /> I have attended COP13 in Bali, COP14 in Poznań, COP15 in Copenhagen, COP17 in Durban, COP18 in Doha, COP19 in Warsaw and will hopefully attend COP21 next year in Paris. I truly hope that the UNFCCC will be able to achieve a global, legally binding climate deal next year but I have reservations.<br /> <br /> COP15 in Copenhagen should have been a turning point. It was a unique opportunity to set the world on the right path to avoid catastrophic climate change. For two days, most of the world's leaders congregated under one roof for a common purpose. Attended by 119 Heads of State, COP15 was the largest gathering of its kind held outside of the annual UN General Assembly in New York. The highlight was the attendance of US President Obama. <br /> <br /> The two weeks of meetings, extending late into the night, marked the culmination of two years of intensive negotiations. The conference was the focus of unprecedented public and media attention. And yet, the result - the Copenhagen Accord - was a shameful compromise.<br /> <br /> The words  legally binding  were conspicuously absent from the three-page text of the Copenhagen Accord. The Accord was merely  politically binding  for those countries that chose to sign up to it. Furthermore, it did not set emissions reduction targets for either 2020 or 2050, nor did it set a deadline by which the action points should become legally binding.<br /> <br /> The French newspaper Liberation lamented the speed and commitment to saving the planet compared with saving the global financial system:  We must make the bitter observation: when it comes to rescuing the banking system, the dialogue has been far more effective and determined. It is clearly easier to save finance, than it is to save the planet.  Since COP15 expectations have been declining steadily with each conference. At COP20, they are at an all-time low. <br /> <br /> After having seen the discussions in the Plenary this morning, I wonder how much we've learned since Copenhagen.  <br /> <br /> <strong>CLIMATE INJUSTICE</strong><br /> <br /> 2014 will probably end up being the hottest year since records began in 1880, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We have already matched 1998's temperatures, previously the warmest year on record. Time is running out. Inaction will lead to severe and irreversible damage. <br /> <br /> Climate change will affect everyone, everywhere, in every nation and in every echelon of society in the developing and developed world. We will all suffer the catastrophic consequences of: rising sea levels, desertification, food and water scarcity and political unrest. But some of the most vulnerable communities in the world are bearing a disproportionate burden of the harm without having significantly contributed to the cause. This is a terrible injustice.<br /> <br /> Hearing delegates' responses to the ADP text this morning, reinforced my opinion that there is a bias and injustice inherent in these negotiations. Failure to acknowledge different countries' different responsibilities can only end in failure. A comprehensive, legally binding, global climate deal must make provision for the rights of all and acknowledge that some countries are more responsible for climate change than others. We must achieve<a href= C:\Users\Bianca\Downloads\Climate Change Justice and Human Rights Report FULL.pdf  target= _hplink > Climate Justice</a>, a recognition that climate change will disproportionately affect people who have less ability to prevent, adapt or otherwise respond to increasingly extreme weather events, rising sea levels and increasing resource scarcity. <br /> <br /> The COP has always drawn lines drawn between the 'haves' and the 'have nots', between so-called 'developing countries' and the developed world, between the 'global north' and 'global south.' The climate talks are often fraught with bias and discrimination towards the global south, women, indigenous people and the poor as well as protesters. Their voices and that of civil society are often ignored in negotiations. <br /> <br /> Sometimes even freedom of expression is curtailed at the COP, as we have seen here this week.  <br /> <br /> COP rules require protesters to submit their banners and slogans for approval, and prohibit the mention of specific names, officials and projects. Alyssa Johnson Kurts, with the US youth delegation SustainUS told Democracy Now,  We tried to submit a banner that would have an arrow with Keystone XL in one direction and a liveable future in the other direction, and they rejected that proposal,  she says. <br /> <br /> In contrast, very few restrictions are placed on the fossil fuel companies that come to the COP. Corporations and fossil fuel companies have always had a presence at the negotiations. Yesterday, December 12th, 350.org delivered a petition with 53,000 signatures to the COP organisers, calling for fossil fuel corporations and their lobbyists to be banned from the negotiations.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://350.org/press-release/53000-call-on-unfccc-to-ban-fossil-fuel-corporations-from-the-climate-talks/  target= _hplink >Hoda Baraka, </a>Global Communications Manager for 350.org, said 'The fossil fuel industry is actively lobbying against climate action and standing in the way of progress. When you're trying to burn the table down, you don't deserve a seat at it.'<br /> <br /> <strong>REDD+ </strong><br /> <br /> REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) was identified as a key area of focus for Lima. COP20 President, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, announced forests as a critical theme and set the goal of realising  progress made in regards to the role of forests (REDD+).  REDD+ is our opportunity to make a global commitment to forest conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.<br /> <br /> It is critical that these developments should respond to the concerns of indigenous people and guarantee full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in all processes, programmes and actions at all levels, including their access to funding mechanisms, financing and capacity building. This must include a robust and enforceable system of social, environmental and human rights safeguards.<br /> <br /> REDD+ is beset by a fundamental difference in thinking. Some see REDD+ as an important framework that will bring both forest preservation and will benefit indigenous tribes. <a href= http://www.regnskog.no/en/rainforest-foundation-norway  target= _hplink >Rainforest Foundation Norway </a>for example has  a rights-based approach to rainforest protection. We believe that the peoples who for generations have developed their cultures and societies in balanced interaction with the highly complex yet vulnerable ecosystems of the rainforest have fundamental rights to these areas. Legal recognition of the collective territorial and cultural rights of forest-based peoples and communities is crucial to the fulfilment of their human rights. It is also a major prerequisite for protecting the rainforest.  Unfortunately there is another school of thought, dangerous dissenters who see REDD+ only as a profit making new market that exists to be exploited.<br /> <br /> The negotiations and decision-making should have been easy - protecting and advancing the land rights of indigenous people will advance their human rights protections and will also reduce cumulative carbon emissions through healthy and flourishing forests. But the REDD+ negotiations at COP20 collapsed. Climate justice remains a long way off.<br /> <br /> I gave the keynote address at the REDD+ Implementation Working Group: Legal and Governance Foundations, Indigenous Peoples Rights and Safeguards on December 5th... Morale was low among the negotiators, and sure enough, negotiations reached a deadlock, or REDDLock, and came to a complete halt that Friday here in Lima. <br /> <br /> The REDD+ talks broke down in part because there has been no agreement on guidance for the safeguards. Countries like the United States and Norway were pushing for more clarity on how these safeguards are reported, but nations like Brazil and Panama among others claimed guidance would be burdensome, slowing implementation of forest protection measures.<br /> <br /> The REDD+ Safeguards Working Group stated as far back as Cop15, 'No rights, no REDD.'<br /> <br /> Shamefully, there will be no concrete outcome on forest protection at COP 20, despite this COP being held in Peru, one of the world's largest rainforest countries. Deliberations have concluded for this session.  <br /> <br /> Once again, a critical decision regarding indigenous rights and environmental protection has been postponed until the next UNFCCC inter-sessional meeting in June 2015. Time is running out.<br /> <br /> <strong>FORESTS</strong><br /> <br /> As I said in all the five presentations I made at COP20, forests of all kinds are essential to our future. The Amazon in particular is home to about a third of our planet's terrestrial life forms, cycles nearly a quarter of the Earth's freshwater, absorbs around 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year and plays a vital role in moderating the climate. <br /> <br /> More than 1.6 billion people depend on forests for food, water, fuel, medicines, traditional cultures and livelihoods. Forests support up to 80% of biodiversity on earth and play a vital role in safeguarding the climate by naturally sequestering carbon. <br /> <br /> Globally, deforestation accounts for up to 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, or roughly 5.8 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent released into the atmosphere, each year. This is more than global transport and aviation combined. According to the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, reducing deforestation is the  single largest opportunity for cost-effective and immediate reductions of carbon emissions. <br /> <br /> The organisation I founded and Chair, the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation (BJHRF) and I are committed to forest conservation. That is why, in 2012, I became IUCN Ambassador for the Bonn Challenge, the largest restoration initiative the world has ever seen. The objective of the Bonn Challenge is to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land across the world by 2020. There are 2 billion hectares of degraded and deforested land across the world with potential for restoration. Restoring 150 million hectares would capture 47 Gigatonnes of CO2, and reduce the emissions gap by 17%. Forest restoration is invaluable in the race to tackle climate change.<br /> <br /> Already more than 51 million hectares of land have been committed to the Bonn Challenge, from the following countries: United States, Rwanda, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the Brazilian Mata Atlantica Restoration Pact, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Niger, Colombia, Ethiopia and Guatemala.<br /> <br /> <strong>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND THE FORESTS</strong><br /> <br /> During my participation at COP20, I spoke at several events that addressed the issue of indigenous people's rights, their land and the forest. On December 8th I spoke at the Indigenous people's Hearing on Deforestation and Indigenous Peoples at the Museum of Art in Lima, and the Tri-Caucus and Human Rights & Climate Change Working Group celebration of the first ever Human Rights Day at the UNFCCC on December 10th. I heard many moving testimonies.<br />  <br /> At both events, there weren't enough translators, or enough headphones to go around, and many of the audience didn't speak English - so I did my own translation and switched between English and Spanish throughout the speeches.<br /> <br /> For most of my life I have believed that in order to tackle climate change, we need the forests. In order to protect the forests, we need indigenous people: their wisdom and knowledge. Indigenous people should be at the centre of climate change negotiations. They have been proven the best custodians of ecosystems. <br /> <br /> A <a href= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17583004.2014.990680  target= _hplink >report </a>released on the second of December, titled 'Forest Carbon in Amazonia: The Unrecognised Contribution of Indigenous Territories and Protected Natural Areas' proves what I have long known: that indigenous territories achieve nearly one third (32.8%) of the Amazon's carbon storage - equivalent to all of the forests in the Democratic Republic of Congo. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BELOMONTETODAY.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-BELOMONTETODAY.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BELOMONTETODAY-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>The Belo Monte dam in 2014. When I visited in 2012, this was still a river flowing through a rainforest.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>INDIGENOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS</strong><br /> <br /> I was hoping that COP20 in Peru, the heartland of many indigenous tribes. would be the conference where we were finally going to address the issue of indigenous people's rights. <br /> <br /> Tragically indigenous rights are being violated all over the world. They are under siege from unscrupulous governments, mining, drilling, dams, logging and development. Rather than being empowered to use their ecological wisdom and understanding to protect and restore the rain forests, indigenous people face persecution in many corners of the world: murder, abuse and human rights violations: including here in Peru.  <br /> <br /> In September this year, in the Ucayali province to the west of Lima, Edwin Chota Valera, Leoncio Quincima Meléndez, Jorge Ríos Pérez and Francisco Pinedo of the Ashéninka tribe were murdered. Valera was the chief of the Ashéninka. They were killed for defending the rainforest that their communities depend on. Perez's daughter told<a href= http://www.newsweek.com/2014/11/28/dismembered-bodies-raise-stakes-amazonian-tribes-286169.html  target= _hplink > Newsweek</a>,  It feels like a knife in my heart. Nothing will cure it. It will last forever. My father fought, and we will go on until we get change or we die.  <br /> <br /> As natural resources become scarcer, and the pressure upon them increases with increasing population, disputes over land rights, particularly where oil exploration, hydroelectric, mining agribusiness and logging are concerned, are intensifying. Indigenous communities are particularly hard hit and their fundamental rights to life and land are violated in many countries throughout the world.<br /> <br /> I was shocked and grieved to learn on Sunday 7th December that the body of Jose Isidro Tendetza, former vice-president of the Shuar Federation of Zamora, Ecuador, had been found. He had been missing since November 28th, since he set off to a meeting of campaigners against the Mirador copper mine, which is threatening to decimate the Shuar's ancestral land. <br /> <br /> That same Sunday I met with Ecuadorian Minister of the Environment Lorena Tapia to urge her government to do everything in their power to investigate this terrible crime.<br /> <br /> Global Witness's Deadly Environment <a href= http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Deadly%20Environment.pdf  target= _hplink >report,</a> published in December 2013, named Peru as the fourth worst country in the world for such killings, with almost 60 murders since 2002. <br /> <br /> The Philippines is in third place with 67 murders, followed by Honduras in second place with 109. Brazil holds the dubious honour of first place, with 448 murders.<br /> <br /> <strong>BRAZIL - DAMS IN THE AMAZON</strong><br /> <br /> Brazil's New Constitution of 1988 was pioneering, a significant step for indigenous peoples' rights. It called for the demarcation of all indigenous lands in Brazil by 1993. As a result thousands of forest peoples were granted the right to their ancestral land which they need for subsistence or spiritual heritage. <br /> <br /> In the past Brazil had an average of thirteen demarcations per year. Unfortunately under President Dilma Rousseff's administration, which favours development, large-scale agriculture projects, hydroelectric mega dams, plantations, drilling and mining operations, the number of demarcations has sunk to three a year.<br /> <br /> Even with demarcation, ancestral land is not safe. <br /> <br /> For many years I have been supporting the communities and indigenous people threatened by the Belo Monte, Madeira and the Tapajós Dam complexes in Brazil. I went on a fact-finding mission to Xingu and the Madeira Rivers in 2012. The dams will impact hundreds of tribes; tens of thousands of people.

In the Tapajós basin, in the heart of the Amazon, the government plans to construct up to 29 large dams, following the same destructive model as Belo Monte. One tribe in the region, the Mundukuru, a proud warrior tribe, are continuing to resist the planned Tapajós development. They have decided to auto-demarcate their territory in response to the Rousseff administration's refusal to recognise their land rights.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-MUNDURUKUTRIBLEPROTESTINGTHETAPAJOSDAMSBYAaronVincentElkaim.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-MUNDURUKUTRIBLEPROTESTINGTHETAPAJOSDAMSBYAaronVincentElkaim.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-MUNDURUKUTRIBLEPROTESTINGTHETAPAJOSDAMSBYAaronVincentElkaim-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <em>Munduruku people protesting the Tapajos Dams, credit Aaron Vincent Elkaim</em><br /> <br /> During my 2012 fact finding mission, I met with Jose Carlos Arara, leader of the Arara tribe. He said to me:  The government does not tell us the truth or listen to us. They are not complying with the laws of the land and they are not respecting our rights. Our survival is now in the hands of the government and Norte Energia. The Brazilian government is only thinking about profit and growth. The Belo Monte will take away our autonomy and our right to survive. <br /> <br /> I also met with Dr Erwin Kraütler the Bishop of the Xingu. He said to me,  Belo Monte will be an apocalypse for the Amazon. And the Amazon is important for the world climate. It will have consequences not only for Brazil but for the world. I cannot agree -- not only as a bishop, but as a man -- I cannot agree with this decision, which threatens the survival of future generations. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-DOMERWINKRAUTLER.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-DOMERWINKRAUTLER.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-DOMERWINKRAUTLER-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>Bishop Erwin Krautler</em><br /> <br /> The Brazilian government has used the legal mechanism of Security Suspension  or  Suspensão de Segurança,  to allow them to steamroll its own laws and constitution. Citing the dubious rationale of national security, threatening blackouts and energy crises, the government has been allowed to arbitrarily and repeatedly overturn legal rulings that would have paralyzed Belo Monte and several other dam projects which are currently under construction.<br /> <br /> In Brazil on the 9th December 2014 the Proposed Constitutional Amendment 215 (PEC 215) was <a href= http://amazonwatch.org/news/2013/0808-indigenous-rights-under-assault-in-brazil  target= _hplink >debated</a> in parliament. This Amendment If approved, would transfer authority to demarcate lands from the Executive to Legislative branch. The Amendment would prohibit ancestral land demarcations of indigenous territories. If this Amendment goes through, the Ruralista  - a conservative bloc that represents the country's growing agribusiness sector would have the decision making power. The debate has been postponed until next week. If it passes, this is a deeply troubling development.<br /> <br /> <strong>DAMS IN THE AMAZON</strong><br /> <br /> 412 dams are planned across the Amazon rainforest. 256 of them are in Brazil, 77 in Peru, 55 in Ecuador, 14 in Bolivia, six in Venezuela, two in Guyana, and one each in Colombia, French Guyana and Surinam. Five of the six rivers which run through the world's largest tropical forest will be dammed - and damned. All over Brazil, even now, the Amazon's waterways are being blocked and diverted. The river system that provides almost a quarter of the world's fresh water is being dammed, polluted and fouled up. <br /> <br /> The dams being built throughout South America present a threat to millions of indigenous people. In Brazil alone, 80,000 people will be displaced.<br /> <br /> Those who are most affected by these dams are the communities and indigenous people, who live in the surrounding areas. These megadams are threatening their survival, way of life and culture.<br /> <br /> All countries must comply with Article 169 of the International Labour Organization's Convention. It is imperative that indigenous rights, including the right to 'free, prior and informed consent,' are respected. Indigenous peoples' land and territorial rights must be protected in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and with State obligations under related human rights instruments. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand why the Latin American countries where megadams are planned, do not opt for renewable energy instead of building these costly - both economically and in terms of human rights - dams. Everything these governments claim that these megadams will deliver could instead be achieved with renewable energy, which would not have the same devastating impact on this vast, fragile ecosystem. Renewable energy is not merely the solution to Latin America's mounting energy needs: it is the solution to all our needs. Promoting renewable energy must now become a global and universal priority. These technologies are the only viable solution to the imminent energy crisis. Nothing is macro-economically more necessary, more practical or cheaper than the conversion of our energy systems from conventional energies to renewable energy.<br /> <br /> <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER IN THE RAINFOREST</strong><br /> <br /> It's not just megadams which are threatening indigenous people and the Amazon. <br /> <br /> As COP20 drags on inside the military compound which the <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/09/the-amazon-oil-spills-overlooked-by-environmental-leaders-in-lima?CMP=share_btn_tw  target= _hplink >Guardian </a>newspaper refers to as a 'climate fortress,' there are human rights and environmental disasters happening in Peru. The Peruvian government is pursuing expansion of oil and gas operations in the Amazon.<br /> <br /> Over the last few months, as the world was preparing for the COP, the North Peruvian Petroperú oil pipeline, which runs through the Amazon for 850 miles, has broken in five places. The spills have, to quote the Guardian: 'spewed thick black clots of crude across jungle and swamp and carpeted local fishing lagoons with dead fish.' <br /> <br /> Two of the spills are clearly visible from the air: dark scars across the green forest. Indigenous communities nearby report illness in their children; dead fish and the corpses of small animals are clogging up the river. <br /> <br /> Such activities by governments and corporations are egregious human rights violations. They cause irreparable and irreversible damage to the environment and accelerate climate change. Greg Asner of the Carnegie Institution for Science found, in a <a href= http://news.mongabay.com/2014/1110-at-risk-carbon-stocks-in-peru.html#sthash.esOgQkka.dpbs  target= _hplink >report </a>published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that  nearly a billion metric tons of above-ground carbon stocks in Peru are at imminent risk for emission into the atmosphere due to land uses such as fossil fuel oil exploration, cattle ranching, oil palm plantations and gold mining.  <br /> <br /> Resistance to granting indigenous peoples rights to their ancestral land is motivated by profit. Many governments know that beneath indigenous lands lie great reserves of fossil fuels and minerals and they are willing to sacrifice lives and the environment to access them.<br /> <br /> The Peruvian government is not the only one exploring for oil in the Amazon. The Biosphere of<a href= http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2066313/is_this_the_end_of_yasuni_national_park.html  target= _hplink > Yasuni </a>National Park in Ecuador is home to a record number of animal and plant species, not to mention the Tagaeri and Taromenane clans of the Waorani, whose ancestral lands sit atop Ecuador's largest undeveloped oil reserves. 90% of the Ecuadorian population opposes the move to drill, but President Correa insists he has 'no choice.' By<a href= http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0602-hance-yasuni-oil-permits.html#ixzz3LoulJbMD  target= _hplink > 2016</a>, a subsidiary of the national oil company, Petroamazonas will be drilling in Yasuni Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputinin (ITT) block, an untouched swathe of primary rainforest covering around 100,000 hectares. <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/08/ecuador-rejects-petition-oil-drilling-yasuni  target= _hplink >The  Guardian newspaper </a>alleges that Ecuador has negotiated a secret deal with Chinese bank over ITT's oil.<br /> <br /> The BJHRF and I also have been supporting the Mayangna people in their struggle to protect their ancestral land - the Biosphere Reserve of Bosawás in Nicaragua, the second largest rain forest in the western hemisphere, home to approximately 40,000 indigenous Mayangna. Bosawás is part of Nicaragua's national patrimony - a unique preserve of indigenous culture. <br /> <br /> The lives of the Mayangna and Bosawás's unique ecosystems are threatened by invasions of illegal loggers and settlers. The Mayangna leader Charley Taylor was killed on April 24th 2013, trying to defend his lands from loggers, who had cleared 35 acres of precious hardwoods. These invaders have deforested around 150,000 hectares since 2009, are polluting the rivers and threatening the Mayangna people. If these illegal activities are allowed to continue, in ten years Bosawás may no longer exist.<br /> <br /> I have appealed to President Daniel Ortega to declare a state of emergency in Bosawás.<br /> <br /> <strong>WOMEN AND CLIMATE CHANGE</strong><br /> <br /> The Government of Peru announced on December 8th, gender day here at the COP, that Peru will become the first country in South America to incorporate a Climate Change Gender Action Plan into its national climate policy and planning, and the 14th country in the world to do so. This is wonderful news. <br /> <br /> I met some extraordinary and courageous women indigenous leaders when I spoke at the WECAN event, Women on the Frontlines of Climate Change, on December 8th. Patricia Gualinga, the Kichwa leader from Sarayaku, Ecuador, Ruth Buendia, an Asháninka Leader from Peru, Alicia Cahuiya Iteca of the Huaroni, Ecuador, Tantoo Cardinal of the Tar Sands in Canada among many others. These are inspiring women, standing up to defend the rights of future generations, they are unflinching defenders of their people and their ancestral lands. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BJWITHPATRICIAGUALINGAOFTHESARAYAKUINECUADORANDALICIACAHUIYAITECAOFTHEHUAROANIECUADOR8.12.14COP20.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-BJWITHPATRICIAGUALINGAOFTHESARAYAKUINECUADORANDALICIACAHUIYAITECAOFTHEHUAROANIECUADOR8.12.14COP20.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BJWITHPATRICIAGUALINGAOFTHESARAYAKUINECUADORANDALICIACAHUIYAITECAOFTHEHUAROANIECUADOR8.12.14COP20-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <em>Bianca Jagger with Patricia Gualinga, and Alicia Cahuiya Ateca</em><br /> <br /> Some of them spoke about Pachamama, the goddess of nature and balance who is honoured here in Peru, and across South America You could translate Pachamama as Mother Earth but it's more than that. 'Pacha' means more than  earth  - the word also implies the cosmos, universe, time, space... We can't translate Pachamama literally into English, but perhaps a better attempt would be <a href= https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Pachamama.html  target= _hplink >Mother World</a>.<br /> <br /> I urge the COP to remember Pachamana and her rights. What's at stake is our future, and that of future generations.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately women are underrepresented in UNFCCC negotiations, at all the COPs. The UNFCCC has a terrible track record with gender equality. The term wasn't mentioned in documents until 2007. <br /> <br /> Gender equality isn't mentioned in the ADP text. The Philippines human rights language I mentioned earlier, pushed by Ghana and Mexico, would right this omission.<br /> <br /> 'fair, inclusive, respectful of human rights and particularly rights of indigenous people and women.'<br /> <br /> This language has been ignored, and the only mention of gender is a stated intent to ask the COP to <br /> <br /> <blockquote>'(iv) Provide meaningful and regular opportunities for the effective engagement of experts from Parties, relevant international organizations, civil society, indigenous peoples, women, youth, academic institutions, the private sector, and subnational authorities nominated by their respective countries;'</blockquote><br />  <br /> This is woefully inadequate. Climate change is an issue of gender equality. <br /> <br /> In addition there has been shameful compromise in the Subsidiary Body for Implementation SBI two year work programme to advance gender. The SBI work programme was decided in Warsaw, and was a welcome step forward. <br /> <br /> But this week, in a travesty of cowardly wording, the term  'gender equality' was replaced by 'gender balance' in the <a href= http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2014/sbi/eng/l43rev01.pdf  target= _hplink >text </a>of the SBI decision on the Work Progamme on Gender, at the behest of Saudi Arabia. Gender balance is a purely numerical term. It has nothing to do with equality. Gender equality is mentioned once in the Decision, in a context that negates it. I urge you to read Diego Ortiz's excellent<a href= http://adoptanegotiator.org/how-we-are-losing-the-gender-equality-battle-against-saudi-arabia/  target= _hplink > analysis</a> regarding this on the blog adoptanegotiator. Mexico remained the only country which continued to push for the term 'gender equality' to be used throughout the text. <br /> <br /> This is a fatal step back for gender equality. I am appalled. My only hope is that the COP reopens the topic in Paris. <br /> <br /> I am very concerned.  What would this mean for gender equality at the UN, in the global climate agreement, and for future generations?<br /> <br /> <strong>MOVING FORWARD</strong><br /> <br /> We need to achieve a legally binding global climate treaty at COP21 in Paris next year. Failure is not an option. In order to do so we need to reach an equitable agreement on the INDCs now, and agree a draft text that paves the way. <br /> <br /> It is an example of the bizarre nature of the negotiations at COP20 that, at least this week, the Catholic Church seems to have expressed more progressive views on climate change than most representatives of government here at the UN Climate Conference.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://ncronline.org/blogs/eco-catholic/catholic-bishops-lima-delegates-end-fossil-fuels-tend-vulnerable-climate-deal  target= _hplink >The Obispos Declaration</a>, which was released by 9 Catholic bishops from Peru, Brazil, Dhaka, France and South Africa on December 10th called for new models of development and lifestyle, stating that  central to this is to put an end to the fossil fuel era, phasing out fossil fuel emissions and phasing in 100% renewables with sustainable energy access for all . I couldn't agree more. In fact, I feel vindicated... I have been calling for reform to our model of development and a phasing out of fossil fuels for many years. You can read what I wrote about the UN Conference on Sustainable Development Rio+20<a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bianca-jagger/the-document-adopted-at-r_b_1627736.html  target= _hplink > here</a>... <br /> <br /> As I write, we're still waiting for an outcome, here at COP20. Now and then, above the din of traffic and the chatter you can hear the squawks of parakeets. <br /> <br /> At past COPs pressure from the US and other developed countries to cut proceedings short, decision, or no decision, has resulted in a failure to reach an agreement. This tactic was being employed again at COP20. When US representative Todd Stern spoke this morning he warned of the 'hour glass running out,' that failure to accept the draft text could jeopardise the UNFCCC's status. <br /> <br /> I hope for once the countries can have the courage of their convictions and emerge from COP20 with a concrete outcome. I hope the delegates don't let schedules and timekeeping become the determining factor, once again. Unfortunately I have witnessed the failure of the COPs too often to hold out much hope. Let's hope that Paris brings the change we need. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 10:40:32 -0500"	"world"
"Haiti PM Resigns Amid Political Protests"	"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe announced early Sunday that he was resigning along with several ministers in the wake of violent anti-government protests and a commission's call for him to step down.<br /> <br /> In a speech that was delayed past midnight, Lamothe said he was leaving  with a sense of accomplishment,  adding:  This country has undergone a deep and dynamic transformation and a real change in benefit of its people.  President Michel Martelly said earlier he accepted the findings of the commission that had recommended Lamothe's replacement.<br /> <br /> Martelly appointed Lamothe as prime minister in 2012, and some political analysts believe Lamothe might seek the presidency in upcoming elections.<br /> <br /> Lamothe's resignation complicates the current political situation because nominations for a new prime minister require approval from Parliament and it is unclear whether someone would be nominated before Parliament is dissolves in January, said Michael Deibert, author of  Notes from the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti. <br /> <br /> He noted that Lamothe was Martelly's third nomination for prime minister during a drawn-out selection process.<br /> <br />  Without a functioning Parliament and without a prime minister, I'm afraid it could be a tumultuous time in January,  Deibert said in a telephone interview from Cap-Haitien.<br /> <br /> He warned that political instability would undermine confidence in the government and the confidence that the international community has in Haiti in terms of investment.  That's not an image that Haiti wants to project to the world,  Deibert said.<br /> <br /> Haiti's capital has endured a growing number of violent demonstrations in recent weeks during which protesters have demanded the holding of elections that were expected in 2011 and the resignations of Lamothe as well as Martelly.<br /> <br /> On Saturday, one man was found dead in a protest in Port-Au-Prince during clashes with police who fired tear gas. It was not immediately clear how the man died, but he was shot at least once in the wrist. Demonstrations also spread to other towns, including Gonaives and Cap-Haitien.<br /> <br /> The unrest followed a demonstration Friday in which U.N. peacekeeping troops opened fire on a crowd that marched through Port-au-Prince, set tires on fire and skirmished with troops and police.<br /> <br /> Martelly's administration blamed the delay in holding elections on six opposition senators who contend legislation that would authorize the vote unfairly favors the government.<br /> <br /> The commission set up to break the impasse recommended that Lamothe resign, along with the head of the Supreme Court and current members of Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council. It also called for the release of several  political prisoners. <br /> <br /> Martelly said he would meet Monday with government officials to discuss the commission's report.<br /> <br /> Administration officials have insisted the government wants to hold the elections. The terms of 10 senators expire in mid-January and Parliament will be dissolved, meaning Martelly would rule by decree.<br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico."

"China Shocked By Fatal Riot In Madagascar"	"BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese Embassy in Madagascar expressed shock Sunday at a deadly riot involving local workers at a Chinese-run sugar plant and criticized the island nation's government for failing to protect Chinese interests.<br /> <br /> The statement came three days after local workers clashed with Madagascar security forces, leaving two people dead, before they looted the sugar plant in Morondava. The embassy said the Chinese staff evacuated the factory because of fears for their safety.<br /> <br />  We hope the Madagascar government will take necessary measures to properly handle the attack at the Morondava sugar plant and to erase the ill impact this incident has brought to the country's international image and its ability to attract foreign investments so as to create a good environment for Madagascar to cooperate with China and other countries,  the statement said.<br /> <br /> Madagascar Prime Minister Roger Kolo and the country's industry minister, Jules Etienne Rolland, have pledged to try to resolve the situation.<br /> <br /> The labor protest started when the plant's seasonal workers demanded contracts that offer better pay and better conditions, according to reports.<br /> <br /> The Chinese Embassy said the requests were unreasonable, and that the workers began in early November to block the factory, cutting off utilities, harassing employees and sabotaging equipment.<br /> <br /> Confrontation escalated after Madagascar security forces arrested two strike leaders.<br /> <br /> On Wednesday, about 500 workers rushed to a base of the security forces to demand the release of their colleagues, and police fired tear gas and live ammunition, the Madagascar Tribune reported. Two people died. Police said they were acting in self-defense because some workers had guns and machetes<br /> <br /> The official China News Service said the workers were armed with axes, slingshots and rocks.<br /> <br /> Rioters then converged on the factory, looted its sugar supply and set fire to a building. Some looters carried bags of sugar on their backs or in carts and wheelbarrows, and some of it was quickly sold on the illegal market, according to reports.<br /> <br /> China is Africa's largest trading partner, but closer ties have resulted in sometimes violent labor disputes.<br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Associated Press writer Christopher Torchia in Johannesburg contributed to this report."

"Russia Denies One Of Its Military Planes Nearly Collided With A Passenger Jet"	"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's Defense Ministry on Sunday denied Swedish claims that for the second time this year a Russian military aircraft had nearly collided with a passenger jet over Sweden, insisting that the two planes were never less than 70 kilometers (42 miles) apart.<br /> <br /> Scandinavian Airlines, which was operating the commercial flight, also said the incident had been blown out of proportion and that no danger had been posed to Friday's flight from Copenhagen to Poznan, Poland. Swedish military officials raised the alarm on Saturday by announcing that the Russian intelligence plane, which had turned off its transponders to avoid commercial radar, had come dangerously close to colliding with the passenger jet.<br /> <br />  This is serious. This is inappropriate. This is outright dangerous when you turn off the transponder,  Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said on Swedish radio.<br /> <br /> Russia responded on Sunday by insisting that its military aircraft had been operating in compliance with rules governing international airspace and flying at a safe distance from routes used by civilian flights.<br /> <br />  There were no prerequisites for an air accident,  Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.<br /> <br /> SAS also said the Russian aircraft had maintained a safe distance.<br /> <br />  This has been blown out of all proportion, completely,  SAS spokesman Knut Morten Johansen said.  It wasn't even an incident.  He said there was no breach  because the safety distance between aircraft hadn't been exceeded. <br /> <br /> Sweden's air force chief, Maj. Gen. Micael Byden, said Saturday that the incident in international air space looked  pretty serious  and the commercial flight was immediately ordered to change course, but he said it was not as serious as in March when a Russian plane flying without transponders came within 100 meters (300 feet) of another SAS plane that had taken off from Copenhagen.<br /> <br /> Russia has increased its military presence in the Baltic Sea area as tensions with the West have risen over the conflict in Ukraine. NATO also has air patrols over the Baltic Sea and rotates NATO military units in and out of member countries in the region.<br /> <br /> Konashenkov said the number of flights by NATO warplanes along Russia's borders has tripled in recent months, and a NATO reconnaissance plane was flying between the Russian aircraft and the passenger jet on Friday. NATO aircraft also fly in international air space with their transponders switched off, he said.<br /> <br /> Carl Bildt, the former Swedish foreign minister, said this practice should be changed.  Should we seek an agreement for all military planes in international air in Baltic area to use transponders?

"At Least 32 Dead, 76 Missing In Central Indonesia Mudslide"	"BANJARNEGARA, Indonesia (AP) — Rescuers pulled more bodies from the debris Sunday after heavy rain in central Indonesia loosened soil and collapsed a hill, setting off a landslide that killed at least 32 villagers and left 76 others missing under piles of mud.<br /> <br /> About 2,000 rescuers, including soldiers, police and volunteers, were digging through the mud and the wreckage of crumpled homes, getting some relief from clear weather following days of heavy rain. Excavators, meanwhile, shoved aside earth and the remains of decimated wooden homes. Residents of Jemblung village in Central Java province's Banjarnegara district said they heard a roaring sound followed by the raining down of red soil that buried more than 100 houses late Friday.<br /> <br />  The landslide looked like it was spinning down,  said one resident, Subroto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.  I managed to rescue a pregnant woman, but could not save the other man. <br /> <br /> He said one side of the hill collapsed, then another.  In five minutes, there were three (major landslides) and they swept away everything,  Subroto said.<br /> <br /> By late afternoon Sunday, 32 bodies had been pulled from the debris, while hopes faded that the 76 people still missing would be found alive, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.<br /> <br /> Many roads and bridges were destroyed, hampering rescue efforts, Nugroho said.<br /> <br /> Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at the scene Sunday. He pledged to relocate the hundreds of people left homeless by the disaster, and assured that the government would help provide aid for those who were injured. Eleven injured villagers were hospitalized.<br /> <br /> Many people in Jemblung village said they were aware that the earth on the 150-meter (yard) hill that flanked their remote farming village may not hold. After hearing a deep rumbling sound just after dusk Friday, some fled to safer ground.<br /> <br /> But others were either at home or at the local mosque when the mud, rocks and trees tumbled onto their village.<br /> <br /> Wawan Wahyuni, a 20-year-old farmer, said he watched helplessly as his grandfather and dozens of his neighbors disappeared beneath mud more than 6 meters (20 feet) deep in some spots.<br /> <br />  I saw them buried alive,  Wahyuni said.  They were yelling 'Allah Akbar! (God is great!) before being slowly buried. <br /> <br /> Wahyuni himself was buried up to his chest until survivors rescued him seven hours later.<br /> <br /> Banjarnegara is located on Indonesia's most densely populated island of Java, about 460 kilometers (285 miles) east of Jakarta.<br /> <br /> Seasonal rains and high tides in recent days have caused dozens of landslides and widespread flooding across much of Indonesia, a chain of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile, flood-prone plains close to rivers.<br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta contributed to this report."

He called on religious leaders to  speak out against the Taliban.</br>                <br> These acts are not Islamic and are inhuman,  he said.</br>                <br>The Taliban's increasingly bold attacks in Kabul have led  to the government being criticized for serious security  failures.</br>                <br>Ghani said he was seeking to revive a security body last  seen during a Soviet-backed government in the 1980s. He did not  give more details, but his spokesman said the new body would  coordinate between police, military and intelligence agencies.</br>                <br> The number of forces we have in Kabul is sufficient, but  the way they are being used is a problem, we have to change  that,  spokesman Nazifullah Salarzai said after the event.</br>                <br>Kabul houses thousands of soldiers and police armed with  light and heavy weapons. It is fortified with razor wire-topped  concrete blast walls and dotted with checkpoints. But this does  not seem to have curbed the Taliban's confidence.</br>                <br>On Thursday, a suicide bombing at a French cultural center  guarded by the army in central Kabul killed a German man, who  was attending a performance of a play denouncing suicide bombs.</br>                <br>When two Kabul guest houses used by foreigners were targeted  within days of each other last month, the Kabul police chief  lost his position, although the official reason for his  dismissal remains unclear.</br>                <br/>                <br> FRAGILE SECURITY </br>                <br>In the past two days, Taliban fighters shot dead a dozen  workers removing landmines in the south of the country, killed  seven soldiers and blew up a military convoy, killing two U.S.  soldiers near Bagram Airfield, north of the capital.</br>                <br>On a trip to northern Afghanistan on Saturday, German  defense minister Ursula von der Leyen described the security  situation as  fragile. </br>                <br>Ghani has yet to announce a cabinet two months after he took  office in a power-sharing agreement with his main rival,  Abdullah Abdullah, a situation critics say has left the country  adrift while the Taliban are cranking up violence.</br>                <br>Salarzai said the president devoted a third of his time to  security and that, in the long run, the slow selection of  officials would assure good governance in a country plagued by  political corruption.</br>                <br>He added that the government was committed to naming the  cabinet within the next two weeks.</br>                <br>Officials say the delay in selecting ministers is the result  of Ghani's power tussle with Abdullah, who joined the government  after a disputed election.

"Catholic Church In Australia: 'Obligatory Celibacy May Have Contributed To Abuse'"	"VATICAN CITY (RNS) The Roman Catholic Church in Australia acknowledged that “obligatory celibacy” may have contributed to decades of clerical sexual abuse of children in what may be the first such admission by church officials around the world.<br /> <br /> A church advisory group called the Truth, Justice and Healing Council made the startling admission Friday (Dec. 12) in a report to the government’s Royal Commission, which is examining thousands of cases of abuse in Australia.<br /> <br /> The 44-page report by the council attacked church culture and the impact of what it called “obedience and closed environments” in some religious orders and institutions.<br /> <br /> “Church institutions and their leaders, over many decades, seemed to turn a blind eye, either instinctively or deliberately, to the abuse happening within their diocese or religious order, protecting the institution rather than caring for the child,” the report said.<br /> <br /> “Obedience and closed environments also seem to have had a role in the prevalence of abuse within some religious orders and dioceses.  Obligatory celibacy may also have contributed to abuse.”<br /> <br /> The council’s CEO, Francis Sullivan, who has held various administrative roles in the health sector, including heading Catholic Health Australia, said clergy training should include “psychosexual development.”<br /> <br /> “It’s a no-brainer,” Sullivan said. “You need to address how sexuality is understood and acted out by members of the clergy.”<br /> <br /> But the Chicago-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, which represents around 20,000 victims worldwide, said the latest report did little to help protect those at risk from abuse.<br /> <br /> “Decisive action is needed, not more reports,” SNAP national director David Clohessy said. “The church hierarchy knows what’s needed. It simply refuses to give up its power and enable secular authorities to investigate and prosecute those who commit and conceal sexual violence against the vulnerable.”<br /> <br /> The Vatican’s chief spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, could not be reached for comment Friday. But Maltese Bishop Charles Scicluna, the Vatican’s former chief prosecutor for abuse cases, tried to put the report in context in remarks to the Italian daily La Stampa.<br /> <br /> “You mustn’t forget that most abuse occurs in the family,” he said. “Obviously I don’t exclude individual cases where celibacy is lived badly that may have psychological consequences. But it should be said clearly that it is certainly not the origin of this sad and very painful phenomenon and remember that there is no nexus between cause and effect.”<br /> <br /> The suggestion of a link between celibacy and child sexual abuse has divided Australian Catholic leaders in the past.<br /> <br /> Cardinal George Pell, former archbishop of Sydney and now head of the Vatican’s powerful economic ministry, acknowledged there may be a connection when he testified before a separate government inquiry in Australia last year. He was unavailable for comment at the Vatican Friday.<br /> <br /> The independent Australian council is made up of church and lay members and is supervised by some of the nation’s senior archbishops, though its views do not necessarily reflect those of all senior clergy.

"PM Abe's Coalition Cruises To Big Win In Japan's Election, Amid Low Turnout"	"<br>By Linda Sieg and Antoni Slodkowski</br>                <br>TOKYO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo  Abe's ruling coalition cruised to a big election win on Sunday,  but feeble turnout could weaken his claim of a mandate for  policies including reflationary steps to revive the economy.</br>                <br>Most media exit polls showed Abe's Liberal Democratic Party  and its junior partner, the Komeito party, winning more than 317  seats in the 475-member lower house, enough to maintain its   super-majority  that smoothes parliamentary business.</br>                <br>But many voters, doubtful both of the premier's  Abenomics   strategy to end deflation and generate growth and the  opposition's ability to come up with a better plan, stayed at  home, putting turnout on track for a record low, interim figures  showed.</br>                <br>Turnout had already hit a post-war record low of 59.3  percent in the 2012 poll that returned Abe to power for a rare  second term on pledges to reboot an economy plagued by deflation  and an aging, shrinking population.</br>                <br>Hopes for Abe's  Three Arrows  of hyper-easy monetary  policy, government spending and reforms such as deregulation  were tarnished after the economy slipped into recession in the  third quarter following an April sales tax rise. Recent data  suggest any rebound is fragile.</br>                <br>Abe decided last month to put off a second tax hike to 10  percent until April 2017, raising concerns about how Japan will  curb its huge public debt, the worst among advanced nations.</br>                <br> I worry that Japan's public finances will get even worse,   said 38-year-old Tokyo voter Akihiro Fujihara.</br>                <br> I wish there was a party out there that would come up with  actual proposals to make Japan a better place to live. </br>                <br/>                <br>OPPOSITION GAINS LITTLE TRACTION</br>                <br>The main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) was   unable to gain much traction, largely due to voters' memories of  a 2009-2012 rule plagued by policy flip-flops, infighting and  three premiers in three years.</br>                <br>Exit polls showed the DPJ gaining from the 62 seats it held  before the vote, but falling well short of the 100 seats it had  unofficially targeted.</br>                <br>Abe called the election in a bid to strengthen his grip on  power before tackling unpopular policies such as restarting  nuclear reactors taken off-line after the 2011 Fukushima  disaster and a security policy shift away from post-war  pacifism.</br>                <br>The LDP-led coalition victory could make it easier for Abe  to be re-elected in a party leadership race next September,  boosting the chance he stays in power through 2018 and becomes  one of Japan's rare long-term leaders.</br>                <br>Aside from local elections in April, his coalition will  probably not need to face voters until a 2016 election for the  upper house, where the LDP and the Komeito party now hold a  majority.</br>                <br>Doubts, however, persist over whether Abe will knuckle down  on his  third arrow  of reforms in politically sensitive areas  such as labor market deregulation that would make it easier to  shift workers to growth areas but also to lay off employees, and  reform of the highly protected farm sector.</br>                <br>Critics say progress has been limited, partly due to  opposition from members of Abe's own party.</br>                <br> My personal assessment is that we are likely to see more of  what we've seen - piecemeal reforms moving more or less in the  right direction, but at a fairly slow clip and no bold  breakthroughs because of this election,  Columbia University  professor Gerry Curtis said before the results were in.</br>                <br>Some experts say Abe could also turn attention away from the  economy to his conservative agenda that includes laying the  groundwork to revise the post-war, pacifist constitution and  recasting Japan's wartime past with a less apologetic tone.</br>                <br>That agenda raises hackles in China and South Korea, where  bitter memories of Japan's past militarism run deep.</br>                <br>The LDP had 295 seats and Komeito 31 in the 480-member lower  house when it was dissolved for the election. Five seats were  cut through electoral reform.     (Additional reporting by Thomas Wilson; Editing by Dean Yates  and Mike Collett-White)</br> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 06:40:00 -0500"	"world"
"Ashton Kutcher Hints Charlie Sheen May Return To 'Two And A Half Men'"	"While a guest on  The Ellen DeGeneres Show  on Friday, Ashton Kutcher sparked rumors of Charlie Sheen's return to  Two and a Half Men.  Kutcher teased that he is scared of what the showrunners have planned for the last episode. DeGeneres then asked if Sheen would be coming back, to which Kutcher replied with a stunned, silent shrug. <br /> <br />  If you're working on the Warner Bros. lot, if there's sirens, come save me,  Kutcher added. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year, Sheen told Extra that he would return to the show if asked. <br /> <br />  I would <a href= http://extratv.com/2014/10/30/charlie-sheen-addresses-rumors-hes-returning-to-two-and-a-half-men/  target= _hplink >definitely do it</a>, yeah, yeah,  he said.

"'Ascension' Is a December Rarity; It Doesn't Have a Christmas Theme"	"TV Review                                                               Jackie K Cooper<br />                                                        Ascension  (Syfy)<br /> <br />  Ascension  is a new mini-series on the Syfy Channel that shows a lot of promise. It is a story about a manned spaceship on a one hundred year journey to a new planet, that is also a murder mystery. Both facets of the show are interesting and so you get the best of both worlds. Whether or not you want to devote three nights to it is up to the individual viewer, but it moves quickly and the story is intriguing.<br /> <br /> When the show starts the ship has been in route to the new planet for fifty-one years. People on board the ship have adjusted to the life they have to lead for the most part. However all is not perfect and in the very opening scenes a murder is committed. A young woman is shot and killed. The Captain (Brian Van Holt) wants to keep the murder a secret and say she died accidentally.<br /> <br /> He assigns his First Officer, Aaron Gault (Brandon P Bell), to investigate. One of the mysteries of the mystery is how did anyone get their hands on a gun, as the ship is supposedly weapons free. In a short time Gault has a full list of suspects but no conclusive killer.<br /> <br /> At the end of the first night's episode some startling information is revealed that makes  Ascension  a story with a twist. I didn't see it coming and that is always a good thing when a show is trying to entertain me.<br /> <br /> The main negative is that no one in the cast particularly stands out. The acting ranges from interesting - Tricia Helfer as the Captain's wife - to abysmal - Van Holt. Just about everyone else falls into the okay range in the middle. One actor who does draw interest is Brad Carter. He plays the  butcher  who lives in the lower levels of the ship. He is a dangerous individual who was involved with Lorelei (Amanda Thompson), the murdered woman.<br /> <br /> There are enough twists and turns to keep the plot moving, and the idea of having six hundred people contained on a spaceship with a mission to keep humanity alive is a good one. The murder investigation keeps this from just being a space adventure, and the surprise twist I mentioned is a good one.<br /> <br /> December is a time when there are many reruns on the major networks. A new mini-series from Syfy is just what Santa needed to bring. It will be a perfect show to watch as the weather turns cold so mark it down on your viewing calendar.<br /> <br />  Ascension  airs December 15, 16 and 17 at 9PM on the Syfy Channel.<br />                    <br />                                                                                                                                Jackie K Cooper<br />             <a href= http://www.jackiekcooper.com ; target= _hplink >www.jackiekcooper.com</a> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 23:05:22 -0500"	"entertainment"

"Dysfunction in the Nonprofit Sector--Reality or Myth?"	"Judging from the vast literature on dysfunctional nonprofit boards and organizations (my own posts included!) one might conclude that the majority of nonprofits are struggling, strategically incompetent and/or in crisis. I argue that this is not the case. Decades of experience lead me to believe that nonprofits have the same functional variables as profit making organizations--dysfunctional at times like Target or GM; efficient like Apple or Whole Foods; adaptable like Del Monte and Cisco. Everybody doesn't get it right all the time.<br /> <br /> Perceptions become reality to those who are quick to embrace popular labels such as the overused term,  dysfunctional.  Obviously, in the case of nonprofits, such perceptions are harmful. Once evaluated in this way the stigma persists and can seriously reduce the level of support that is so critical to the work of these organizations.<br /> <br />    <strong> What characteristics color these perceptions?</strong><br /> <br /> • <strong>Small Organizations</strong>: About one-third of the charitable nonprofits have gross receipts under $25,000 a year. At that level the vast majority can't employ more than one full-time person, overworking those with job responsibilities that can't be delegated. While small organization can't do much to improve the misperceptions about nonprofit dysfunctions, more mature ones can take deliberate steps over time.<br /> <br /> • <strong>The Volunteer Challenge:</strong> A large cadre of board and operational volunteers take time to assist struggling charities, which give the organizations appearances of nonprofit always being on the edge or existence. Many outsiders are unaware that those on management and staff are highly competent people who accept this employment condition because they know how their work can positively impact the lives of clients.<br /> <br /> • <strong>Facilities</strong>: Nonprofit facilities are often second rate and appear highly dysfunctional. Client needs, not facilities, are primary to the board, management and staff.<br /> <br /> •<strong> Board Relationships:</strong> Many relationships between the board and management can be similar to that of a  parent-child  one. In the words of one nonprofit director,  We tell the executive director exactly what to do. <br /> <br /> • <strong>Stakeholders</strong>: They often do not appreciate the tremendous impacts that the staff can have. Example: Donors often don't have contact with those who directly benefit.<br /> <br /> • <strong>Board Dysfunctions</strong>: A root cause of the perception may be due to a dysfunctional board trying to resolve internal conflicts, and there is little the management and staff can do about it. Valiant managements and staffs can sometimes achieve productive impacts without board support.<br /> <br />     <strong>What can be done?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Competency & Relationships:</strong> I have encountered many CEOs who have more management expertise than many of their board members who are professors, accountants or physician, etc. While I appreciated that dealing with volunteer directors may involve working with some persons with outsized egos, the CEO must strive to portray himself as a competent manager. The positive outcome is that the CEO is viewed as a peer working with the board, not under the board.<br /> <br /> Many staff persons figuratively stand ten feet tall for what they accomplish on behalf of clients.. The CEO has an obligation to make sure that the stories about outstanding staff personnel are well acknowledged, so that stakeholders know about them. This takes more then simple public relations events. It involves highlighting and rewarding those who are highly productive.<br /> <br /> <strong>Facilities</strong>: I understand the tradeoff between expenditures for facilities versus expenditures for clients. Having first class facilities may even hinder achieving a mission if donors perceive their donations are being used for plush facilities. At the least, the nonprofit needs to have an uncluttered area for board meetings and events with outside stakeholders.<br /> <br /> <strong>Implications</strong>: Many suggest that a nonprofit organization being perceived as dysfunctional is not an important issue, as long as mission objectives and impacts are achieved. I argue that more resources for clients could be developed if the perception is not a diminished one. Some can equate dysfunction with being inefficient. In addition, a positive perception might make it easier to attract more qualified board members, management and staff. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 14:25:09 -0500"	"business"
"3 Climate Lessons From Lima"	"<center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HuffPostCOP20.png ><img alt= 2014-12-13-HuffPostCOP20.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HuffPostCOP20-thumb.png  width= 570  height= 249  /></a></center><br /> <br /> <em>This post was co-authored with Romina Picolotti and V. Ramanathan.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Climate change cannot be solved without leadership from heads of government, without immediate mitigation of near-term warming, and without cutting short-lived climate pollutants to complement the UN climate agreement.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>1. Climate change cannot be solved by ministers alone, but requires leadership from heads of government. </strong> <br /> <br /> By moving climate to the leader level over the past 18 months, President Obama changed the  climate  of the climate change negotiations. His effort started with his first meeting with President Xi of China in Sunnylands, California last June, where the two biggest climate polluters reached two agreements: the first to cooperate on threats from North Korea, the second to cooperate to reduce super greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs.  President Obama followed this up with other bilateral agreements on HFCs with President Xi and Prime Minister Modi, as well as agreements through the G7 and G20, and with the historic announcement last month on China-US climate mitigation.  Success with the President's domestic climate efforts is giving him the credibility he needs not only to continue his leadership through Paris next year but also to ensure U.S. citizens that their government is working to protect them from an irreversible climate crisis. Leadership from heads of religious institutions is also important to garner public support on a massive scale. The Catholic church under Pope Francis has taken it first step when in his first homily he called for the protection of the Earth. <br /> <br /> <strong>2. The UN climate agreement cannot move fast enough on its own to slow near-term Earth warming.  </strong><br /> <br /> Fast action mitigation inside and outside the UN climate agreement is essential, starting immediately. Fast mitigation is needed to fill the time gap to 2020, when any new climate agreement will, by its terms, go into effect, assuming it is concluded in Paris next year. Solving a fast moving problem like climate change requires a fast moving governance system.  The climate game could be lost before the anticipated UN agreement even goes into effect in 2020.  Already, the Arctic sea ice is disappearing and shrinking the protective white shield that reflects heat back to space, the permafrost line is moving north and releasing stored methane and carbon dioxide, forests are dying and giving up the carbon dioxide from the biomass and soils, and ocean carbon dioxide storage is slowing down. Speed matters, and the UN climate process is not going to be able provide it on its own. Fast mitigation from all relevant venues is essential for slowing impacts and facilitating adaptation. It also provides measurable improvements that will motivate political leaders and citizens to do more.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. The UN climate agreement cannot solve climate by itself. </strong> <br /> <br /> Solving climate change is not just about a UN climate agreement. Complementary mitigation is needed in all possible venues, at local, national, and international levels, along with adaptation.  Complementary mitigation includes using the world's best environmental treaty, the Montreal Protocol, to virtually eliminate one of the six main greenhouse gases by phasing down production and use of HFCs, leaving accounting and reporting in the UN climate process. This can provide the equivalent of 100 to 200 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide mitigation by 2050 and avoid up to 0.5°C of warming by end of century.  Other complementary mitigation includes using national and regional laws and institutions to cut black carbon and air pollutants that produce ozone in smog, powerful climate pollutants that are not included in the UN climate discussions, but kill more than seven million people every year, including 135,000 in the U.S., and lead to over one hundred million tons of crops destruction each year. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants, launched by the U.S. and a handful of allies two years ago, is helping fill the gap with actions to reduce black carbon, methane, and HFCs. Cutting these climate pollutants using existing technologies and existing laws and institutions can cut the rate of global warming in half in the near-term through mid-century, and by two-thirds in the Arctic. <br /> <br /> Cutting the rate of warming by half is essential for adaptation, because it is always better to prevent damage than to adapt to damage. Leadership from heads of government and a plan of action for fast mitigation to complement the UN agreement can start to answer the legitimate demands of all citizens for their governments to avoid the irreversible climate crisis.<br /> <br /> --<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Romina Picolotti</strong> is co-founder and president of the Center for Human Rights & Environment in Argentina, former Secretary of Environment of Argentina, and recipient of Norway's Sophie Prize.</em><br /> <br /> <em><strong>Veerabhadran Ramanathan</strong> is distinguished professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of California, San Diego, who discovered the greenhouse effect of chlorofluorocarbons in 1975.</em><br /> <em><br /> <strong>Durwood J.

"Damning Report Claims Mexican Federal Police Participated In Disappearance Of 43 Students"	"Mexico's federal police collaborated with local forces in the September attack on 43 students whose disappearance and presumed killings have led to mass protests in the country, according to an investigative report published Sunday in the Mexican magazine Proceso.<br /> <br /> Federal authorities also likely tortured key witnesses who offered critical testimony for an investigation by the Mexican attorney general's office into the disappearances, the lead reporter for the Proceso story told The Huffington Post.<br /> <br /> The Proceso investigation is based on leaked government documents that are not publicly available, as well as a report by the state government of Guerrero, where the students' college was located and where they were attacked. The magazine published an <a href= http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=390560  target= _hplink >abbreviated version of its story on Saturday</a>, as well as a <a href= http://www.eldiariodecoahuila.com.mx/notas/2014/12/14/historia-oficial-475018.asp  target= _hplink >newswire version</a> on Sunday. The full investigation was published Sunday in a print version of the magazine, only available in Mexico.<br /> <br /> Both the newsire and early version of the Proceso investigation sharply contradict the version of events put forth by Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s administration, at a time when a widespread protest movement has questioned the government’s handling of the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the missing students.<br /> <br /> “We have information that proves the federal government knew what was happening in the moment it was happening, and participated in it,” Anabel Hernández, the lead reporter for the Proceso piece, told HuffPost in a telephone interview. “The government has tried to hide this information.” <br /> <br /> Proceso's story was co-authored by journalist Steve Fisher and supported by the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley. The Mexican attorney general's office and the president's office did not immediately respond to requests from HuffPost for comment on the story.<br /> <br /> On Sept. 26, a group of students from the Ayotzinapa rural teachers college in the southwestern state of Guerrero <a href= http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/10/29/mexico-students-missing.html  target= _hplink >traveled to the nearby city of Iguala</a> to take part in a protest. They were ambushed and shot at along the way by police forces, <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/mexico-finds-mass-graves-with-28-bodies-where-students-went-missing/2014/10/06/009b049f-a59d-482d-bd4c-3a10cbef0fe6_story.html  target= _hplink >leading to three deaths</a> and several injuries.<br /> <br /> Several students escaped, but 43 of them disappeared -- feeding a protest movement with international reach and months of speculation over the role of security forces in their presumed killings.<br /> <br /> The federal government has maintained that the students were first attacked by local police acting on the orders of the mayor of the town of Iguala, José Luis Abarca, and his wife, María de los Ángeles Pineda, both of whom were <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/world/americas/Iguala-mayor-wife-missing-students-mexico.html?gwh=35D89B3DA1F668A847CBA429816A8E10&gwt=pay  target= _hplink >detained</a> last month. Local police, according to the government, then handed 43 of the students off to members of the Guerreros Unidos drug cartel, who killed them and disposed of their remains.<br /> <br /> But the Guerrero state report says that federal police began watching the students from the moment they left Ayotzinapa at 5:59 p.m. on buses heading toward Iguala, Proceso said. According to the magazine's account of the state report, both federal and state police were monitoring the students as they traveled, and federal police joined in stopping and shooting the students.<br /> <br /> Proceso said that according to the state report, the first gunshots were reported at 9:40 p.m. to Mexico's Center of Control, Command, Communications and Computation, or C4, a communication structure used by federal and local security forces, as well as the military. Though the C4 unit in Iguala is run by state authorities, Proceso said that both federal police and the military have access to its communications -- making it impossible that the federal authorities would not have known about the attack as it was happening.<br /> <br /> Univision.com said Saturday that Proceso's revelations clearly contradict the federal government’s previous statements that the violent incident was carried out by local authorities, without its knowledge, in collusion with drug traffickers.<br /> <br /> “There’s no way the Peña Nieto government can say they didn’t know know what was happening,” <a href= http://noticias.univision.com/article/2189091/2014-12-13/mexico/noticias/revelan-que-el-gobierno-de-pena-nieto-participo-en-ataque-contra-alumnos-de-ayotzinapa?cmpid=Tweet:article  target= _hplink >Univisión.com wrote in Spanish in an article published Saturday</a>.<br /> <br /> The Proceso article also questions the federal government’s handling of key witnesses in the investigation into the students' disappearance, according to Hernández. Federal authorities have relied primarily on testimony from alleged drug traffickers, who have said they were involved in killing the students and incinerating their bodies.<br /> <br /> But Hernández told HuffPost that documents she obtained from the attorney general's office show that witnesses who testified had been tortured by federal authorities or the military during interrogations completed prior to their testimonies. The documents detail telltale signs of beatings on the witnesses' bodies, Hernández said --  black eyes, marks on the neck, bruising on the ribs and signs that authorities had electrocuted one witness's testicles. One witness had a series of red dots over his body that Hernández said also likely indicated electrocution.<br /> <br /> “The version given by the federal government, by the attorney general’s office, is based solely on testimony by presumed drug traffickers,” Hernández said.  What we found is that, in at least five cases, these testimonies were obtained using torture. <br /> <br /> Hernández said torture is prohibited in Mexico and would make the evidence inadmissible. The fact that the brutal tactics were apparently used to force confessions also casts doubt on the reliability of the information obtained, she said.<br /> <br /> The version of the Proceso report published on Saturday includes a short video of compiled footage Proceso says the students took on their cell phones the night of attacks. At one point, voices in the footage shout  don't shoot  and  get down  in Spanish, after crying out  they already killed one  and asking to call an ambulance. Toward the end of the video, the students quietly talk to each other, saying that “the police are leaving, the federal [police] are going to stay. They’re going to hassle us.”<br /> <br /> <center><strong>Watch the video below (in Spanish):</strong><br /> <iframe width= 570  height= 321  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/yYzy0TRNirE  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br /> <br /> Though the Proceso report offers seemingly damning evidence showing some level of federal involvement, <a href= http://fusion.net/story/33887/mexican-federales-involved-in-shooting-cover-up-of-missing-43-students-says-new-report/  target= _hplink >Fusion reported Sunday</a> that it could not corroborate the allegations in interviews with two survivors of the attack.<br /> <br /> In early November, the Peña Nieto administration announced that members of the Guerreros Unidos cartel had <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/07/mexico-missing-students_n_6124004.html  target= _hplink >confessed to killing the students and burning their bodies</a>, before <a href= http://www.noticiasrcn.com/internacional-america/asesinos-43-estudiantes-mexicanos-admiten-quemaron-sus-cuerpos  target= _hplink >discarding the remains</a> in a nearby river.

"Different Strokes For Different Folks"	"Every now and then when I'm searching for a theme to write about, I find inspiration in a most unusual source: serendipitous calendaring. Even though I might not have imagined any possible kind of idea that could connect two performances I'm scheduled to attend on consecutive nights, something happens after the house lights go down that leaves me positively gobsmacked.<br /> <br /> Often, the connection is something that could never have been imagined on paper or in theory. It's only after the curtain rises that cognitive links begin to emerge. A recent example (which involved two legendary pieces of musical theatre) was particularly breathtaking.<br /> <br /> <ul><li>Both works have clearly stood the test of time -- one is an opera that had its world premiere on December 26, 1831 at Teatro alla Scala in Milan; the other is a popular Broadway musical that premiered on October 23, 1972.</li><br /> <li>Both works have been identified as classics of their particular genre -- Vincenzo Bellini's opera is a cornerstone of the <em>bel canto</em> repertoire; Stephen Schwartz's musical is often cited as the definitive showcase for Bob Fosse's artistic vision as a stage director and choreographer with  Magic To Do. </li><br /> <li>Both works make important historical references to the political power of Rome: in the opera, Pollione is a proconsul of the Roman Republic stationed in Gaul who has been romantically involved with not one, but two Druid priestesses; one of the main characters in the musical (Charlemagne) was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in 800.</li></ul><br /> <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-20-Karl_der_Grosse__Pippin_der_Bucklige.jpg ><img alt= 2014-10-20-Karl_der_Grosse__Pippin_der_Bucklige.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-20-Karl_der_Grosse__Pippin_der_Bucklige-thumb.jpg  width= 400  height= 628  /></a><br /> <br /> A 10th century copy of a tapestry from approximately 830 <br /> showing King Charlemagne with Pippin the Hunchback <br /> (Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)</center><br /> <br /> <br /> <ul><li>Both works contain surprisingly strong anti-war messages in their narratives.</li><br /> <li>Both works went on to become key successes in their composer's catalog.</li><br /> <li>Both works require performers who have mastered an extraordinary set of acrobatic skills: one vocal, the other a combination of dance and gymnastics.</li><br /> <li>Both works require artists who are confident in their stamina as vocal or physical athletes.</li><br /> <li>Both works can be severely impacted by the acoustics of any particular performance (one relies on singers using their diaphragms for breath control to  float  a beautiful musical line; the other depends heavily on electronic amplification whose ability to distort sound can result in the kind of shrillness that compromises the overall quality of a performance).</li><br /> <li>Both works require safe displays of fire onstage.</li></ul><br /> <br /> Who knew?<br /> <br /> <center>* * * * * * * * * *</center><br /> <br /> In an era when few people are accustomed to hearing singers whose voices have not been manipulated by sound engineers, the San Francisco Opera's new production of <em>Norma</em> offered a stunning display of great singing. Not only were the three principals extremely capable artists who could deliver some wonderful vocal shading, their voices were easily able to fill a 3,000-seat auditorium without the help of amplification.

Following her recent Metropolitan Opera triumph, Sondra Radvanovsky awed the audience with her powerfully dramatic portrayal of the titular Druid priestess. Whether tackling the monumentally difficult aria,  Casta Diva,  or singing duets with Jamie Barton's lusciously-voiced Adalgisa, this was a night for the kind of grand singing that is rarely heard anymore.<br /> <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-20-norma3.JPG ><img alt= 2014-10-20-norma3.JPG  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-20-norma3-thumb.JPG  width= 500  height= 338  /></a><br /> <br /> The final moments of Bellini's <em>Norma</em> (Photo by: Cory Weaver) </center> <br /> <br /> <br /> A last-minute substitution for Pollione, young Russell Thomas demonstrated an impressive, powerful tenor with a strong sense of purpose.

The illusions designed by Paul Kieve and circus acts devised by Gypsy Snider of Montreal's <em>7 doigts de la main</em> circus troupe give a much more contemporary feeling to the <em>commedia dell'arte</em> players than was seen in the original Broadway production of <em>Pippin</em>.<br /> <br /> <br /> <center><iframe width= 500  height= 375  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/OEFtq1LbETI  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center> <br /> <br /> <br /> That production, with its book by Roger O. Hirson, was conceived as a one-act, somewhat surreal piece of entertainment that was memorably enhanced by Fosse's thrilling choreography. Its costumes gave a definite sense of period and the production (for which Bob Fosse won the 1973 Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical) worked hard to seduce its audience.<br /> <br /> This revival of <em>Pippin</em> has been choreographed by Chet Walker  in the style of Bob Fosse.  A veteran of many Fosse productions, Walker is keenly in touch with the kind of jazz hands, hat tricks, and angular hip movements used by Fosse beginning in 1954 with the Steam Heat  number from <em>The Pajama Game</em> and on through <em>Sweet Charity</em> (1966), <em>Chicago</em> (1975), and <em>Dancin'</em> (1978).<br /> <br /> <br /> <center><iframe width= 500  height= 375  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/0szHqIXQ2R8  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br /> <br /> <br /> What landed on the stage of the Golden Gate Theatre when the new national touring company of <em>Pippin</em> came to town was a perfect example of the kind of glitter and dazzle that can anesthetize an audience the way too much ice cream eaten too quickly can trigger a sensation of brain freeze.<br /> <br /> <br /> <center><iframe width= 500  height= 375  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/MhBxcEOUDBQ  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br /> <br /> <br /> In the four decades since <em>Pippin</em> premiered on Broadway, some of Schwartz's songs ( Magic To Do,   Corner of the Sky ) have embedded themselves in the popular culture. However, I have a particular fondness for  Spread A Little Sunshine  as sung by Sabrina Harper's leggy Fastrada.<br /> <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-20-pippin1.jpg ><img alt= 2014-10-20-pippin1.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-20-pippin1-thumb.jpg  width= 500  height= 333  /></a><br /> <br /> Sabrina Harper as Fastrada in <em>Pippin</em> (Photo by: Terry Shapiro)</center> <br /> <br /> <br /> John Rubenstein (who portrayed Pippin in the original Broadway cast and now appears as his father, Charlemagne) likens the revised version of the show to focusing on the character of Pippin as  a sort of reality-TV centerpiece.  As Pippin's lusty grandmother, Berthe, Lucie Arnaz had a grand old time leading the audience in a sing-along of  No Time At All. <br /> <br /> Much to my surprise, Matthew James Thomas (Pippin) and Kristine Reese (Catherine) seemed remarkably bland in their roles. Although Sasha Allen is a steely Leading Player, I found myself infinitely more entertained by Callan Berrgmann's performance as Pippin's slimy, scheming brother, Lewis.<br /> <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-20-pippin2.jpg ><img alt= 2014-10-20-pippin2.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-20-pippin2-thumb.jpg  width= 500  height= 497  /></a><br /> <br /> Matthew James Thomas (Pippin) with Callan Bergmann (Lewis)</center> <br /> <br /> <br /> Over the years, <em>Pippin</em> has often been broken into two acts (which, in the case of Paulus's 2013 revival, means that a great deal of shtick has been ladled onto the stage in order to stretch things out). The revised ending, in which the character of Theo takes on the new quest for meaning and fulfillment, is ominously preceded by numerous statements by the Leading Player that  The show is over!   If only someone had made that clear to Ms. Paulus.<br /> <br /> Clad mostly in a combination of acrobatic spandex, this revival's cast aims to clobber the audience into submission by dazzling them with circus stunts and deafening them with amplification. As someone who was never a rabid fan of the original production, I found it ironic to notice how this ardent young hero in search of a life that will bring him meaning and fulfillment is stopped at various points during the show and asked how he feels about his latest experience.<br /> <br />  Empty and vacant,  replies Pippin. I would add  painfully shrill  to his description.<br /> <br /> Curiously enough, three years after staging <em>Pippin</em>, Fosse (known for his salesmanship and cynicism) created the famous  Razzle Dazzle  number for <em>Chicago</em>. Audiences who see both shows (which have been touring simultaneously) will understand how the  Razzle Dazzle  number offers a perfect description of <em>Pippin</em>.<br /> <br /> <br /> <center><iframe width= 500  height= 375  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/TnO7jL_b8rQ  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>To read more of George Heymont go to <a href= http://myculturallandscape.blogspot.com/ >My Cultural Landscape</a></strong> "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 00:45:35 -0500"	"arts"
"First Nighter: Jonny Donahoe's Brilliant 'Every Brilliant Thing'"	"Even before <em>Every Brilliant Thing</em> began I realized the spunky, balding fellow racing about the in-the-round Barrow Street Theatre to hand out sheets of paper and chat with audience members was undoubtedly the solo show's performer, Jonny Donahoe.  I also decided there was something instantly likable about him.<br /> <br /> Then the 60-minute piece started and not only did I like him going about the piece he's co-written with Duncan MacMillan--it's energetically directed by George Perrin--but it hit me that he was a fellow whom audiences would have a hard time resisting.<br /> <br /> By the time he finished what turned out not to be a solo outing at all, I was convinced that though there might have been a dissenter or two among us, just about everyone else in the crowd felt about him exactly as I did.<br /> <br /> And what does Donahoe do that engenders such endearment?  As he roams the intimate room non-stop, he tells the patrons that when he was 7 (he was born in 1980), he learned his mother was in the hospital.  After coaxing his father to explain why, he found out that she had tried to kill herself.<br /> <br /> Upset at the thought that she believed there was no reason to continue living, he had the idea of compiling a list of reasons she should go on.  Starting with  ice cream,  he compiled the list and kept at it, but rather than reading it himself, he calls out numbers.  There's when audience members--on whose slips of paper the numbers appear--shout out the brilliant things he's itemized.  Incidentally, a couple of normally contained reviewing colleagues were among that merry number.<br /> <br /> The number responders aren't the only ones whom he brings into an audience-participation show that proves to me--someone who intensely dislikes audience-participation shows--that there is a right way and a wrong way to do them and that his is about the rightest way I've ever witnessed.  Plus which, he includes lots of music, like Etta James's classic version of  At Last. <br /> <br /> In addition to the many list readers, Donahoe prevails on patrons to impersonate figures in his life.  Among those stood in for are his patient father, a veterinarian who put down a beloved dog called Sherlock Bones, a child psychologist with whom he consulted after his mother's first suicide attempt (yes, there were more) and a favorite college lecturer.<br /> <br /> There's also Sam, the young man with whom he fell in love, eventually married and, sadly, from whom he eventually become estranged. This sequence includes a proposal and acceptance guaranteed to melt all but the hardest hearts. <br /> <br /> The cause of the Jonny-Sam separation is at the heart of Donahoe's mission: bringing forward the prickly matter of depression, suicide and how those affected by family suicides respond over time.  The brilliant thing about <em>Every Brilliant Thing</em> is that admitting to the depression that seeped through him as he matured, Donahoe passes along the solution he found: The List, which, as he continues to call numbers, grows to one million.<br /> <br /> N.B.: He doesn't include each one of them.  Nor does he ask audience members to add to the list with their own favorite things.  Remember this is a 60-minute interlude, but if he's still welcoming additions, I'd like to suggest Fred Astaire and the smiles of Ingrid Bergman, Audrey Hepburn, Julie Christie and Julia Roberts.<br /> <br /> Whether men and women deeply entrenched in their depression will be pulled out of it via the Donahoe method isn't guaranteed, I wouldn't think.  Nonetheless, he's not only demonstrating his apparently successful recovery--he spends much of the hour laughing and taking delight in his helpers--but he also hands out a great gift.<br /> <br /> It's a gift especially meaningful at this season, which, while joyful for many, has a reputation for raising the annual suicide quotient.  If I see a performance piece any time soon that gives me as much pleasure and raises my spirits as high as Jonny Donahoe's has, I'll be grateful.  And if I ever start my own list, he'll be on it prominently. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 21:57:41 -0500"	"arts"
"Legendary Hulk Hogan Says Pro Wrestling Has Moved Past Its 'Barbaric Mindset' About Gays"	"Judgments about someone's sexuality have no place in professional wrestling, said Hulk Hogan. During a recent interview, the legendary grappler -- arguably the biggest name in sports entertainment history -- stated the industry has moved past the  barbaric mindset  which once made it unsafe for athletes to be openly gay. <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-IMG_6209.JPG ><img alt= 2014-12-11-IMG_6209.JPG  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-IMG_6209-thumb.JPG  width= 516  height= 516  /></a></center><br /> <br />  I think everybody's been reeducated, so it's not that big a deal,  said Hogan when asked about the spate of professional athletes, including World Wrestling Entertainment superstar Darren Young, who have come out in recent years. <br /> <br />  At least for me -- and I can only speak from my heart -- I've got people all around me who are gay, so it's not an issue with me,  shared Hogan during an in-person meeting at the new Santa Clara, California-based Levi's Stadium, which will house <em>WrestleMania 31</em> next March 29.  I think the whole world feels like that now. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that optimistic perspective is not entirely accurate. However, Hogan <em>does</em> reflect growing support for LGBT individuals in sports. Jason Collins continued his career with the NBA after coming out in April 2013. Michael Sam, <em>GQ</em>'s Man of the Year, has bounced around the NFL. Likewise, WWE's Young revealed his sexual orientation just last year. <br /> <br /> Not long ago, though, sports -- including big-time wrestling -- were less accommodating for gay competitors. Only recently have most pro athletes remained active in their chosen careers after coming out. Though he didn't deny this reality, Hogan decried the prevailing thoughts of that time. <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-Hulk.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-Hulk.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-Hulk-thumb.jpg  width= 500  height= 375  /></a></center><br /> <br />  For me, and professional sports, if people lost their jobs before, that's a crime to me,  he said,  That's not something that would entertain anybody's thought process that I work with now. <br /> <br /> Fans of the grappling icon, a combined 12-time World Heavyweight champion in WWE and World Championship Wrestling, first became aware of his acceptance of the LGBT community on the televised reality series <em>Brooke Knows Best</em>. On this spin-off of the popular <em>Hogan Knows Best</em>, viewers learned one of daughter Brooke's roommates and eventual best friends, Glenn Douglas Packard, is gay.<br /> <br />  He's one of <em>my</em> best friends too,  Hogan said of Packard.  Brooke was in New York the other day for an interview, and Glenn sent me a text about it. <em>She</em> didn't; he did. <br /> <br /> As Hogan noted, Packard is only one of several key people in his life who are out. According to the star, his interactions with the LGBT community -- particularly in the context of professional wrestling -- extend back to when he first met eventual WWE legend Pat Patterson. <br /> <br />  I knew Pat was gay back in 1976, when he helped me start wrestling,  Hogan stated.  Whenever I see Pat, I give him a big hug and kiss. He's my guy! <br /> <br />  There are several wrestlers in Japan who are gay,  he continued,  I've just never looked at it as anything weird. It was normal. <br /> <br /> <center><iframe width= 420  height= 315  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/MPu6macI3Ew  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br /> <br /> After humble beginnings in the '70s, Hogan became the world's most recognizable pro wrestler in the 1980s. The  Real American  held the then-World Wrestling Federation championship consecutively from 1984-88, headlined the biggest pay-per-view events in history (starting with <em>WrestleMania</em>) and went mainstream through his <em>Rock 'n Wrestling</em> partnership with pop superstar Cyndi Lauper and a role in the blockbuster <em>Rocky III</em>.<br /> <br /> The height of Hogan's in-ring success came during a time when clichéd characters dominated sports entertainment. From African savages to Caucasian hillbillies, pro wrestling reflected the most basic of stereotypes (including a flamboyant, effeminate evil  gay  -- as seen in the above video of The Hulkster facing  Adorable  Adrian Adonis). <br /> <br /> Hogan fired off a list of once-common ethnic stereotypes --  'Asian people are smart,' 'Rednecks are dumb,' 'Black people are fast'  -- when describing the  inherited mindset  professional wrestling operated under during that era.  It's whatever people thought,  he said,  That we realized isn't true. <br /> <br /> Now, though, Hogan says the world -- and the pro wrestling industry as a result -- has been reeducated to see people differently. The once-standard archetypes have been broken down, he said, indicating they have no place in professional wrestling... on -- or <em>off</em> -- camera. Indeed, the WWE frequently partners with Gays & Lesbians Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) and even launched its own <em>Be a Star</em> anti-bullying campaign. <br /> <br />  That barbaric mindset we inherited is not a set piece in people's minds,  Hogan asserted.<br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-IMG_6212.JPG ><img alt= 2014-12-11-IMG_6212.JPG  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-IMG_6212-thumb.JPG  width= 516  height= 570  /></a></center><br /> <br /> Still, the impact of those societal teachings lingers for those who experienced them first-hand, notably Hogan's friend Patterson. On the WWE reality series <em>Legends House</em>, the Hall of Famer tearfully shared a long-standing fear that news of his homosexuality might end his sports entertainment career. When reflecting on Patterson's emotional revelation, Hogan became somber.<br /> <br />  Back when Pat was wrestling, he was afraid to be who he really is -- or was <em>meant</em> to be -- because of all this stuff he inherited from society,  he explained,  'You're supposed to be this tough wrestler.' 'You're supposed to be this good-looking, platinum blonde champion who goes out and dates the best looking women.' 'You're <em>supposed</em> to be this.' 'You're <em>supposed</em> to be that.'  <br /> <br />  But that's not true!  Hogan concluded emphatically,  Pat Patterson is supposed to be who he's <em>meant</em> to be, not who people <em>think</em> he should be, if that makes any sense. <br /> <br /> For those in the LGBT community, it certainly does.

"Police Arrest Suspect In Shooting Death Of Auburn Player"	"AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — A 22-year-old man has been arrested on a felony warrant charging him with murder in Sunday's fatal shooting of Auburn football player Jakell Lenard Mitchell, police said. The shooting took place at the same off-campus apartment complex where two former football players and a third man were slain in 2012.<br /> <br /> Auburn Police said at least 14 hours after the early morning shooting that Markale Deandra Hart of Camp Hill, Alabama, had been taken into custody. Police Capt. Will Matthews also said in an emailed statement that Hart was being held at a county jail and no additional arrests were anticipated.<br /> <br /> It was not immediately known if Hart had an attorney and the statement didn't provide details of how he was taken into custody.<br /> <br /> Police also disclosed new details that the 18-year-old freshman Mitchell had received multiple gunshot wounds to the chest. No one else was reported shot or hurt, police have said.<br /> <br /> Matthews had said hours earlier that police answered a call about 12:25 a.m. Sunday of shots fired at the Tiger Lodge apartment complex, a few miles from the Auburn campus. He said Mitchell was taken to a hospital in nearby Opelika, Alabama, where he was pronounced dead.<br /> <br /> Auburn University team coach Gus Malzahn said Sunday he was  devastated and saddened  by the death of the promising player, a halfback described by the team website as versatile on offense with blocking, catching and running skills.<br /> <br />  My thoughts and prayers are with Jakell's family and friends, who are suffering through this senseless tragedy. I know the Auburn Family is hurting, especially our players and coaches, and we are going to love and support them through this difficult time,  he said in a statement.  We have lost a member of our family too young, too soon. <br /> <br /> Mitchell redshirted this season for the Auburn Tigers out of nearby Opelika High School. Able to play both back and tight end, he was expected to contend for a starting spot next season, reports indicated. Mitchell missed his senior season at Opelika as he recovered from an ACL injury. He had rushed for 392 yards and 17 touchdowns in 2013 as a high school junior.<br /> <br /> The gated apartment complex was quiet Sunday, with large amounts of broken glass in the parking lot and blue spray paint on the ground where police marked possible evidence. Police looked Sunday morning on as a red car bearing the license plate  Jakell  was towed away.<br /> <br /> Police have released few details of exactly what happened, but residents described hearing gunfire and screams.<br /> <br /> Drake Ledet, an Auburn sophomore living in an apartment near the shooting scene, told AP he heard several gunshots after midnight.<br /> <br />  I'd say it was at least eight (shots),  Ledet said, adding he looked outside to see what was happening.  People were screaming ... I saw people scattering everywhere, getting in their cars. <br /> <br /> Ledet and other residents said there were two parties going on Saturday night at the complex. Students had just completed their final exams on Friday and winter graduation ceremonies were held Saturday.<br /> <br /> Jeremy Johnson, Auburn's backup quarterback, was one of those who drove up before midday Sunday to quietly see the site and remember Mitchell. Johnson said he wasn't present at the time of the shooting, but wanted to come by after learning of his teammate's death.<br /> <br />  I couldn't believe it,  Johnson said, growing emotional.  Jakell was a real good kid. <br /> <br /> Auburn Director of Athletics Jay Jacobs called the shooting a  terrible tragedy  in a statement.<br /> <br />  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Jakell Mitchell's family and those who have been impacted by this terrible tragedy. This is a very trying time for those close to Jakell, including the student-athletes, coaches, staff and Auburn Family. We will provide counseling and support and do everything we can to help them through the grieving process,  he said.<br /> <br /> The apartment complex is the same where authorities say Desmonte Leonard killed three men at a party in the summer of 2012. The complex, a few miles from campus, is popular with students. Its name was changed following the 2012 shooting.<br /> <br /> Jurors convicted Leonard of capital murder in the shooting deaths of former Auburn football players Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips along with DeMario Pitts. Three other people were wounded.<br /> <br /> Leonard's attorney said that 2012 shooting stemmed from a fight and that Leonard fired in self-defense. Prosecutors argued that Leonard aimed at the victims and wasn't involved in the initial fight.<br /> <br /> Leonard will be sentenced on Jan. 20. The jury recommended life without parole, but the judge could still sentence him to death.<br /> <br /> At least one Tiger Lodge resident said Sunday he wanted to move from the complex.<br /> <br />  There have been four people killed here. Once again this place is on the national news,  said junior Barrett Kearens. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 16:48:11 -0500"	"sports"

"Go West, Young Dan"	"It's been 20 years since a professional football game was played in Los Angeles.  For our second-largest city, with all of its wealth, entrepreneurial spirit and energy, that's simply not acceptable.<br /> <br /> True, you have near-professional quality some years with UCLA and USC.  Unfortunately, it's not quite the same.<br /> <br /> True, also, the city has space and enough money to put up a new stadium in any one of the many spots that have been proposed, whether downtown at <a href= http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/30/us-usa-california-stadium-idUSKCN0HP0PE20140930  target= _hplink >L.A. Live</a> or near Hollywood Park or in a town away from the city.<br /> <br /> What you don't have is a viable option for a team.  The Raiders returning?  Not likely nor, from what I read, are they wanted.  The Rams coming back?  Also not likely.<br /> <br /> So as someone with a great affection for L.A. (I have a daughter who lives there), allow me to offer a modest suggestion.  Mayor Garcetti and some of the local movers and shakers should invite Daniel M. Snyder to move his Washington Professional Football Team to Los Angeles.  Yes, I'm one of those who doesn't use the Official Team Name, and for the purposes of this discussion, it's a good thing.<br /> <br /> Look, the NFL wants a team here.  Snyder could use a change of scenery.  He has worn out his welcome in Washington, where he has owned the WPFT since 1999.  That kind of thing happens all the time at lower levels of an organization.  Executives come and go, employees/players come and go.  For a football team owner, it's hard to accept the reality that the people you thought should worship you just plain don't like you any more.<br /> <br /> Moving West would allow Snyder to indulge his Hollywood fantasies on a big scale.  He's buds with Tom Cruise, having invested in Cruise's production company as far back as 2006.  Snyder has even produced a couple of movies, one starring Cruise.   Don't believe me?

He likes players with that kind of star appeal also, like Deion Sanders or Robert Griffin III.  He sues people like Hollywood producers do.<br /> <br /> He could either be in the town's team owners club with Ted Lerner of the Nats or Ted Leonsis of the Wizards and Caps, or with Magic Johnson, the lead owner of the Dodgers.  Is that a hard choice?<br /> <br /> We know he likes to live near water.  Snyder cut down a bunch of <a href= http://deadspin.com/dan-snyder-killed-some-trees-and-a-park-ranger-paid-th-1494113337  target= _hplink >trees</a> so that he could view the Potomac River from his mansion.  In L.A. he could buy a little place in Malibu or the Palisades and really see water.  As a bonus, he would get lots better seafood in L.A. than in D.C.  He could drop down to Neptune's Net or one of the other great little places on the PCH any time he wanted.<br /> <br /> Most of all, moving to L.A. would give him what he really wants -- a fan base that can't wait for football to come back.  It wouldn't matter, for a while at least, how good the team is.  It's like when D.C. got baseball back.  For some of us natives who remember the Washington Senators, it was a fabulous day when the team was reborn as the Nationals.  <br /> <br /> Moving to L.A. would allow Snyder to do what people moving West traditionally do -- start over.<br /> Going West would also solve another of Snyder's biggest problems -- the team name.  He's been on the receiving end of a lot of bad press for refusing to change the name given to the team by a racist team founder in the 1930s.  He wouldn't have to pay money for Native Americans to say they see nothing wrong with the current team name.  <br /> <br /> He would  have a built-in excuse for changing the name.  What after all, do R***s have to do with Los Angeles?  As much a lakes do for your NBA team or for trolleys for the National League baseball team.  Perhaps those aren't the best examples.  But the point is, he could change the name and be done with all of the tsouris he's had to put up with.<br /> <br /> And what of the D.C. fan base?  In Snyder's view, the ungrateful wretches who put up tickets for sale at $3 (for standing room) would get what they deserve.  <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, a little break from the drama of pro football might be welcome as we watch the Nats, Wizards and Capitals do well.  We could calm down, chill out and let the drama of the team drain away.<br /> <br /> Of course, part of the deal to move Snyder's team would include a provision that D.C. get the next team to move.  Or else. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 09:21:54 -0500"	"sports"
"'60 Minutes' Examines The Benefits Of Mindfulness"	"Anderson Cooper dove headfirst into the world of mindfulness in a segment <a href= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/anderson-cooper-plugs-in-to-mindfulness/  target= _hplink >on Sunday night's  60 Minutes </a>.<br /> <br />  This is just the next generation of exercise, we’ve got the physical, you know, exercise components down, and now it’s about working out how can we actually train our minds,  Dr. Judson Brewer told Cooper of mindfulness. Dr. Brewer is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the University of Massachusetts.<br /> <br /> Cooper attended a mindfulness retreat and learned about the benefits of meditation, then met with Dr. Brewer and saw that the benefits of meditation are clearly visible via neurological measurements. After thinking of something anxiety-provoking, Cooper begins meditating and on-screen instruments show brain cells instantly reacting to the mindfulness technique.<br /> <br /> As Cooper explains, “Dr. Brewer believes everyone can train their brains to reach that blue mindfulness zone. But he says all the technology we’re surrounded by makes it difficult.”<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Watch the clip from  60 Minutes  above (via CBS)</strong></em> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 18:54:22 -0500"	"science"
"Kansas Pastor Claims She's Received Death Threats For Officiating Same-Sex Weddings"	"A Kansas pastor is refusing to give in to hate.<br /> <br /> Rev. Jackie Carter, a pastor at First Metropolitan Community Church, <a href= http://ksn.com/2014/12/05/wichita-minister-receives-death-threats-over-gay-weddings/  target= _hplink >claims</a> she’s been getting death threats after she started performing same-sex weddings for couples in her area.<br /> <br /> After alleged vandals broke windows at the Wichita church, her congregations is considering taking extra security measures -- like purchasing cameras and having people stand guard outside during services.<br /> <br /> “When you’re here and the phone rings, and there’s heavy breathing and two seconds later the doorbell rings and then somebody’s throwing rocks through the windows. All those things combined create fear,” Carter told <a href= http://ksn.com/2014/12/05/wichita-minister-receives-death-threats-over-gay-weddings/  target= _hplink >KSN</a>.<br /> <br /> Despite the threats to herself and to her church community, Carter says she won’t stop helping LGBT couples tie the knot. <br /> <br /> “I’m not going to change my message of inclusion, I’m not going to change my message of love, and I’m not going to stop marrying people.

However, it is unclear whether the state will continue to recognize these marriages, as Kansas’ ban on same-sex marriage is still being debated in the courts.<br /> <br /> Kansas state is currently facing a <a href= http://www.scribd.com/doc/245530706/2-14-cv-02518-29-ORDER  target= _hplink >lawsuit</a> filed by the<a href= https://aclukansas.org/ks-ban-on-same-sex-marriage-struck-down/  target= _hplink > American Civil Liberties Union</a> on behalf of two lesbian couples who weren’t allowed to obtain marriage licenses in Douglas and Sedgwick County, which is where Carter’s church is located. The state wanted to put a stay on gay marriages as it fought the lawsuit, but the U.S. Supreme Court denied that request last month, the <a href= http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/kansas-now-issuing-gender-neutral-marriage-forms-27543233  target= _hplink >AP</a> reports.<br /> <br /> As of Thursday, Kansas has issued 23 marriage certificates to same-sex couples, according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year, Carter made history by <a href= http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article3986368.html  target= _hplink >officiating the weddings of</a> 15 same-sex couples on the steps of the County Courthouse in Wichita.

"Hanukkah 2014: Dates, Rituals, History And How-Tos For Celebrating The Festival Of Lights (VIDEOS)"	"Hanukkah, the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/judaism/  target= _hplink >Jewish</a> Festival of Lights, is celebrated for eight days <a href= http://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/671899/jewish/When-is-Hanukkah-Chanukah-in-2013-2014-2015-2016-and-2017.htm  target= _hplink >beginning at sundown</a> on Dec. 16, 2014. On the<a href= http://www.hebcal.com/converter/  target= _hplink > Hebrew calendar,</a> the dates are 25 Kislev to 2 Tevet in the year 5775.<br /> <br /> An eight-day celebration, Hanukkah commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in the second century B.C.E. during the Maccabean revolt against oppressive Greek rulers. Jews celebrate the holiday by lighting a nine-branch candelabrum, commonly called a menorah. (Technically,<a href= http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Hanukkah/At_Home/Candlelighting/Hanukkiah.shtml  target= _hplink > the candelabrum for Hanukkah is called a <em>hanukkiah</em></a> to distinguish itself from the seven-branch menorah used in the Temple and described in <a href= http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0225.htm  target= _hplink >Exodus 25</a>.)<br /> <br /> The <a href= http://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/102978/jewish/The-Story-of-Chanukah.htm  target= _hplink >story of Hanukkah</a> is one of revolution and miracles: Greek influence over the Jews in the Land of Israel had become an affront to Jewish culture and ritual. Antiochus, the Greek ruler, forbade Jewish religious practice, so a small group of Jews, the <a href= http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Maccabees.html  target= _hplink >Maccabees</a>, revolted. These Jews eventually prevailed and, as a first order of business, restored the Holy Temple, which had been desecrated. The menorah in the Temple needed to be re-lit because, according to tradition, it should burn continuously. The Temple liberators found one vial of olive oil, enough for one day of light. Miraculously, the oil lasted for eight days.<br /> <br /> Today, Jews everywhere <a href= http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/1701725/jewish/Do-It-Yourself-Chanukah.htm  target= _hplink >light menorahs on each night of Hanukkah</a>. Traditionally, one candle or flame is lit for each night until the eighth night, when all eight lights shine together. The menorah has a ninth  helper  flame -- known as the <em>shamash</em> -- used to light the other candles. This is necessary because in Jewish law the Hanukkah lights' only purpose is to visually proclaim the miracle of the holiday. Jews place the lit menorah in a prominent window in order to fulfill this commandment.<br /> <br /> Gift giving is now a common practice on Hanukkah, and it is therefore a beloved time for many Jewish children. Fried potato pancakes (<em><a href= http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/118319/the-ultimate-latke  target= _hplink >latkes</a></em>) and doughnuts (<em><a href= http://www.marthastewart.com/314744/hanukkah-sufganiyot-jelly-doughnuts  target= _hplink >sufganiyot</a></em>) are traditional fare, and a spinning top (<em><a href= http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Hanukkah/At_Home/Dreidel/How_To_Play.shtml  target= _hplink >dreidel</a></em>) with four Hebrew letters <a href= http://ohr.edu/1309  target= _hplink >has become synonymous with the holiday</a>.

"Bush-Cheney Legacy: More War, More Torture, Fewer Jobs?"	"<img alt= 2014-05-05-BothSides_WebsiteBanner_728x90_041421.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-05-BothSides_WebsiteBanner_728x90_041421.jpg  width= 560  /><br /> <br /> <p><strong>LISTEN HERE:</strong><br /> <center><script src= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/include/audio_player.php?audio_file= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/121514.mp3  type= text/javascript ></script></center></p><br /> <br /> By Mark Green<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Frum and Corn agree that the Feinstein Committee documents  torture  and should have been released but they clash on justifications for the torture. Ditto on Bush-Cheney legacy since, argues Frum,  safety is the goal of the state.  Also: why can't Obama get any economic respect? </strong></em><br /> <br /> <strong>On Senate Torture Report. </strong>The Davids -- Corn and Frum -- agree that the Senate Report does document instances of what can be defined as torture. But Frum explains that, like the start of Civil War, Korean War, WW I and II, bad things happen during the early panic of war because of a 'safety first' ethic to protect the country. Corn, however, rejects that the U.S. previously as matter of policy engaged in torture since  the laws of war were still observed  and we prosecuted/executed some Japanese generals for waterboarding. Also: Corn emphasizes that the Army Field Manual explicitly prohibits it; the Senate Report began on a 14-1 bi-partisan vote after the Agency destroyed videotapes of torture and was released with 9-6 vote; the FBI refused to do what CIA did. <br /> <br /> <em>Is the cost to America's reputation not the Report's release but the practice of torture itself? Does the release enhance accountability so that future presidents are unlikely to do this again? </em>Frum agrees that release was appropriate because  people learn lessons about going too far... but the person affected is more likely to be someone in the field than a president.  <br /> <br /> <em>You agree then that it's important to have a strict rule against torture but if there's a one-in-a-million Jack Bauer-like hypothetical horrible, then a president or local interrogator will have to decide whether to violate the rule and accept the consequences?</em> Lincoln said,  do you not amputate the leg to save the body?  when he suspended Habeas during the Civil War. There seems to be an uneasy consensus about an anti-torture rule with a ticking nuc bomb opt-out. (Calling John Grisholm.)<br /> <br /> But there's no consensus on whether this report will now forever tar Bush-Cheney historically as torturers... the way we largely associate Hoover with  Depression  and Nixon with  Watergate Resignation . Corn says,  This is merely another chapter in the narrative of their misguided war that will haunt them,  but Frum, who was a W. speechwriter, adds,  Yes it will be part of the legacy but in the context of how it kept us safer.  He along with a decade of CIA chiefs believe it was effective; a Senate Report of 6000 pages based on 6 million documents, believes that it was not. Concludes Senator Whitehouse,  wrong and not useful is a tough combination. <br /> <br /> <em>Last, does Senate Report show how impossible it is to have congressional oversight over such a secret national security agency?</em> Corn thinks there's an inevitable tension between democracy and secrecy, though Frum argues that this painful Senate oversight document shows that it can work.  This is what a self-correcting system looks like. <br /> <br /> <em>Host: Let's not have historical amnesia here.<br /> <br /> From Gen. George Washington and then through 43 presidents, torture has been regarded as immoral and recently illegal based on the Geneva accords signed by President Ronald Reagan. Now defenders say that this enemy is, what, worse than the Nazis so they deserve a lower standard? That what al Qaeda did on 9/11 is worse than what we did to them (so beheading is now our measure of conduct)? That it was effective (which the Senate report disagrees with, as its  yeah, I robbed the bank but my wife really needed a new car  is a traditional defense)? That drones are worse than torture though the laws of war distinguish between bullets/bombs but not torture of people under your complete control? And if a frightened, unprepared democracy overreacts initially by employing torture, what's Cheney's excuse years later?<br /> <br /> Two other details:<br /> <br /> Strange that Chris Matthews keeps invoking the fantastical Jack Bauer hypothetical. That's like creating a military budget around chance that Putin will explode a suicide vest while at a UN session. Isn't it better to discuss plans for 99.9999 percent likelihoods than amigdola-fueled fiction? Also, I like  wardrobe malfunction  as much as next guy. But don't euphemisms have some limits -- now  torture  becoming  enhanced interrogation  becoming, in Brennan's usage, only  EIT  (wait, isn't that a contraceptive device?). Will we allow word play to squelch debate?</em><br /> <br /> <strong>On Obama Economic Performance.</strong> We listen to a Fox News report on the December jobs report,  The economic news is better, really much better...  Jobs way up after 57 straight months of continuous growth, the stock market nearly tripled since 2009, energy prices are plummeting. <em>So why isn't the country's economic pessimism lifting and Obama getting some credit?</em> Chris Matthews (again) is irate about how a smart political communicator like Reagan would be selling it like hot cakes.<br /> <br /> Frum recalls how the W. White House in 2003-4 was very careful not to excessively boast since things can always go south quickly.  And every person is the world's leading expert on how they're doing so you can't convince them they're doing well if they don't agree. The labor participation rate, especially for men, is at an all-time low and the wealth of families is a fraction of what it was a decade ago. Things are better but... not good. <br /> <br /> Corn explains that the prevailing economic mood is some relief but a lot of uncertainty. And a jobs report can't cure that.<br /> <br /> <em>Ok, if Obama has to be careful about claiming credit, can a 2016 Democratic nominee at least run on argument, why go back to Bush's economy when we can build on our progress? </em>Corn:  If anything, Hillary will probably go all the way back to her husband's good economy and skip Obama. <br /> <br /> <em>Speaking of Hillary, thoughts about Sen. Warren planting her populist flag on the way the budget deal overturned part of Dodd-Frank disallowing banks to speculate with taxpayer money? </em>Frum agrees that right and left should balk at that --  invest your own money!  And there's agreement that Warren populism will affect the economic debate of 2016.<br /> <br /> <em>Mark Green is the creator and host of </em>Both Sides Now<em>.<br /> <br /> You can follow him on Twitter <a href= https://twitter.com/markjgreen  target= _hplink >@markjgreen</a><br /> <br /> Send all comments to <a href= http://Bothsidesradio.com  target= _hplink >Bothsidesradio.com</a>, where you can also listen to prior shows. </em><br /> <br /> <p><img alt= 2013-04-22-PREMIERElogo.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-04-22-PREMIERElogo.png  width= 244  height= 95  /></p><br /> <br /> <br /> <p><img alt= 2014-02-10-BSBTUNEIN.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-02-10-BSBTUNEIN.jpg  width= 244  /></p><br /> <br /> <p><em>Both Sides Now</em> is available<br /> Sat. 5-6 PM EST From Lifestyle TalkRadio Network<br /> & Sun. 8-9 AM EST from Business RadioTalk Network.</p><br /> <br /> <p><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-03-03-BizTalk_Logo1.jpg ><img alt= 2014-03-03-BizTalk_Logo1.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-03-03-BizTalk_Logo1-thumb.jpg  width= 200  /></a></p> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 20:04:50 -0500"	"media"
"Dear Mass Media: Allow the Truth to Breathe"	"I was a young teenager, but I recall the Los Angeles <a href= http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/18/us/los-angeles-riots-fast-facts/  target= _hplink >riots</a> that took place in response to the acquittal of the police officers responsible for beating Rodney King in 1992.<br /> <br /> His mistreatment, caught on a <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW1ZDIXiuS4  target= _hplink >VHS</a> tape, was a springboard for the marginalized community to exhale anger over nearly 500 years of unmitigated <a href= http://rt.com/usa/214079-chomsky-america-racist-society/  target= _hplink >racism</a> in this country.<br /> <br /> The furious people and fires raged on, causing $1 billion in damages and costing 55 people their lives. Years after the rebuilding took place and the LAPD was <a href= http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/05/21/bad-cops  target= _hplink >cleansed</a> of most of its blatant corruption, the pressure would continue to build up in persons of color.<br /> <br /> I did not understand it then, and even if I had, I would not have recognized what it truly meant. No, one needs an <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristen-howerton/white-privilege-doesnt-me_b_5296914.html  target= _hplink >education</a> for that, something that is very hard to attain as a <a href= http://www.racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=280:minor0101&catid=15&Itemid=118  target= _hplink >minority</a> of any kind.<br /> <br /> The words 'white <a href= http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/10/16/bill_oreilly_vs_jon_stewart_on_white_privilege.html  target= _hplink >privilege</a>' and 'civil rights' meant little to me as I sat watching the news coverage. Maybe that is because I was a part of an <a href= http://www.racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=280:minor0101&catid=15&Itemid=118  target= _hplink >underprivileged</a> minority and did not know it yet. It would take years of schooling and seeking out the truth to realize that the marginalization of black folks far surpasses that of most others in this country of the free.<br /> <br /> Perhaps it was because I had lived in an African American foster family or that my friends were every shade of the rainbow, but I did not feel racism growing up.  The truth is that the very institutions that America was founded upon were set up to put a foot on the necks of people of color. I too felt most of the pain that people of color did; I lived among them. However there was a fundamental difference in the experience I had growing up.<br /> <br /> It would not be until I was 26 and in college that I took courses that identified the biases and white privilege the country was founded upon. While it does not serve as an excuse for the criminal and social effects it has created in people of color, it serves as an undisputed explanation.<br /> <br /> Fast forward some 22 years later. Rodney King is dead, the Internet has come leaps and bounds, and citizen journalism comes in the form of videophones that have captured all kinds of civil rights violations. Report after report shows police forces issuing instant judgment much like the movie <em>Judge Dredd</em>. Their bullets become the judge, jury and death sentence. <a href= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ad%20hominem  target= _hplink >Ad homonym</a> attacks begin appearing all over the place on the victims of these crimes. Racist remarks are what some get in response to demanding those in power are held accountable, a reminder that we are most definitely not in a post-racial America.<br /> <br /> Some write off the senseless deaths as being the fault of the deceased. In other words, the slavemasters perceive danger and are supported by those who feel their reaction was <a href= http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/the-case-for-police-reforms-is-much-bigger-than-michael-brown/383210/  target= _hplink >justified</a>. Or maybe these black folk deserved what they had coming: if only they had listened to the officers and submitted, even if their rights were being abused.<br /> <br /> Fear grips <a href= http://www.wpr.org/new-effort-aims-ease-tensions-between-police-racial-minorities  target= _hplink >everyone</a>. Law enforcement feels justified and those who shamelessly possess privilege defend their stance, blaming the victims of these horrific crimes. Yes, they might have been punks in some instances, but they, like everyone else, deserve their day in court.<br /> <br /> Those who are the most enlightened among us realize that even  black on black  violence is a product of the hate that has been shown to this minority for such a long time. Pulling oneself up by our bootstraps is not often an option. These souls fill up a large percent of our <a href= http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1143193?uid=3739776&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21105454023553  target= _hplink >prisons</a>; they have historically lacked education and access to jobs. Their ancestors were made to help build this fine country, by force. It is convenient to forget all of this when we go on shaming and justifying the kind of judgment these humans have endured. Hearing others blame the plight of the black woman, man and child on themselves shows that indeed we are a society that is so shamelessly steeped in white privilege that the majority does not look in the mirror and feel humble that they possess the advantage.<br /> <br /> While the media should be focusing on academic and social approaches to these problems, they find it more interesting to cover the most sensational events when one person of color after another have their lives snuffed out by law enforcement officials who should be protecting them. We see two-minute sound bites of those who are showing their solidarity with these victims, from professional athletes to citizens of every major city in the United States.<br /> <br /> In the city of Greensboro, North Carolina, where I live, white privilege is alive and well. However, so is the spirit of the civil rights movement, a reminder of something we who travel through or work downtown know very well. For those involved in the social justice community, we always expect to see the usual suspects: those individuals who have made it their life work to tirelessly fight for the rights of the most underprivileged. Greensboro journalist Eric Ginsburg, an associate editor for <a href= http://triad-city-beat.com/  target= _hplink ><em>The Triad City Beat</em></a>, has covered many protests through his undergraduate writing career at Guilford College and later as a professional writer. These protests, Ginsburg says, are much different from what he's seen in the past.<br /> <br />  I have seen protests this size in Greensboro about police violence before. What's more notable, I think, is that element of civil disobedience. I think we can expect to see more of it in the coming week, too,  Ginsburg said via Facebook.<br /> <br /> Not many protests in the past have seen downtown roads <a href= http://myfox8.com/2014/12/03/protesters-organizing-in-greensboro-following-eric-garner-decision/  target= _hplink >blocked</a> off without a permit, and the events are attracting more young, fresh faces. The news events of the past few weeks have started a revival in the call for better civil rights and accountability.  <br /> <br /> Much like the <a href= http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/commentary/299/entry  target= _hplink >Woolworth</a> lunch counter that has been preserved by the International Civil Rights Museum, a relic of a time not that long ago that black folk were not allowed to sit with the white, <em>Triad City Beat</em> and other independent newspapers across the country are trying to preserve the rhyme and reason behind these organized events.  They provide the coverage needed to begin to build understanding.<br /> <br /> Ginsburg points out,  Well, I think we have a strong interest in helping people understand what is happening and why. We have a different understanding of what's important (such as journalism versus profit) than some outlets. <br /> <br /> Until other outlets begin to strike the <a href= http://triad-city-beat.com/greensboro-protesters-shut-down-streets-after-eric-garner-decision/  target= _hplink >balance</a> that Ginsburg's <a href= http://triad-city-beat.com/coming-to-a-misunderstanding-about-race-and-privilege/  target= _hplink >publication</a> has, the megaphone that is being used to spread the news of the recent protests may do more harm than good to the effected communities.  <br /> <br /> Whether or not the current movement has traction that will last throughout the winter, it is the media's responsibility to show the true faces and explain the real reasons behind what is taking place. <br /> <br /> Anything less is a crime.

"Friends Say They Pushed UVA 'Jackie' To Call Cops"	"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Three friends of an alleged victim of a gang rape at a University of Virginia frat house told The Associated Press that a magazine article that used the woman's attack to paint a picture of a culture of sexual violence on college campuses was wrong on a number of key points: most important that they didn't encourage her to report the attack and that they were more concerned about their reputations than her well-being.<br /> <br /> One of the friends, a 20-year-old, third-year student referred to as  Randall  in the Rolling Stone article but whose real name is Ryan Duffin, told the AP that not only did he encourage the alleged victim to go to police, but he started to dial 9-1-1 on his cellphone until she begged off saying she just wanted to go back to her dorm and go to sleep.<br /> <br />  I couldn't help but notice that everything that the article said about me was incorrect,  Duffin said.<br /> <br /> The Rolling Stone article set off an intense debate about sexual violence, alcohol, fraternities, and journalism ethics.<br /> <br /> The Associated Press also spoke with the other two friends portrayed in the article: third-year, 20-year-old U.Va. students Kathryn Hendley and Alex Stock, known as  Cindy  and  Andy  in the article. None of the three friends was contacted by the Rolling Stone's reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, before the article was published; each of them rejected multiple assertions made in the article, which has since been retracted.<br /> <br /> All three say Erdely has since reached out to them, and Hendley told the AP Erdely apologized to her for portraying her the way she did.<br /> <br /> The three friends say they continue to work on correcting the record about what happened that night, and at least one, Duffin, wonders to what extent he believes the victim's own version of what happened — or whether any discrepancies in her story matter.<br /> <br />  People at U.Va. want answers just as much as I do,  Duffin says.  But if anything, the takeaway from all this is that I still don't really care if what's presented in this article is true or not because I think it's far more important that people focus on the issue of sexual assault as a whole. <br /> <br /> Other news media have also interviewed the friends but this is the first time each of them agreed to allow their full names to be used. A lawyer representing the victim, who has been identified only as  Jackie,  has declined several requests by the AP to interview Jackie and did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article; the AP does not typically name alleged victims of sexual assault.<br /> <br /> The Rolling Stone article, published last month, described a culture of sexual violence hiding in plain sight at U.Va. The article has roiled the campus and caused a huge backlash, with U.Va. suspending fraternity activities until January, the Board of Visitors appointing an independent investigator to look into the allegations and the university handing the case over to the Charlottesville police.<br /> <br /> The main focus of the piece is an alleged gang rape that Jackie said happened on Sept. 28, 2012, during her first semester on campus. In the article, she said she had gone out on a date with a classmate named  Drew,  who later that night lured her into a secluded room at a frat house. Once inside the room, she said, she was raped by a group of seven fraternity brothers while her date and one other man watched.<br /> <br /> As described in the Rolling Stone article, a distraught Jackie met her three friends at a picnic table in the shadows of the frat house and tearfully told them what had happened.<br /> <br /> While the article said Duffin suggested they take her to the hospital, it described Stock and Hendley as carrying on a debate about what would happen to her reputation and theirs should word get out.<br /> <br />  The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackie's rape, while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress, wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep, forgetful sleep,  the article said.  Detached, Jackie listened as Cindy prevailed over the group: 'She's gonna be the girl who cried rape, and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again.' <br /> <br /> However, Hendley told the AP that not only did she not say any of that, she had arrived with Stock to the picnic table only to have Jackie say she didn't want her to be part of the conversation. She said she watched from afar while Stock and Duffin talked with Jackie.<br /> <br /> Stock confirmed this account.<br /> <br /> As described by Duffin to the AP, this is what happened: He had returned home from a party when he got a call from Jackie. He left to meet her and she was sitting on the top of a picnic table outside U.Va.'s Tuttle-Dunnington dorm. She was shaking and  it looked like she had been crying,  Duffin said.  Her lip was quivering, her eyes were darting around. And right then, I put two and two together. I knew she had been on this date and people don't usually look like that after a date. <br /> <br /> Jackie eventually told Duffin her version of what she said had happened that night: that she was gang raped at a frat house.<br /> <br />  My first reaction was, 'We need to go to police,'  he said.  I wanted to go to police immediately. I was really forceful on that, actually. And I almost took it to calling (the police) right there.  He said he had his phone out, prepared to call 9-1-1,  but she didn't want to and,  he remembers thinking,  'I can't do that if she doesn't want to do it.' <br /> <br /> Stock corroborated this version of events.<br /> <br />  Jackie's response was, 'I don't want to,'  Stock said.  'I don't want to do that right now. I just want to go to bed.' <br /> <br /> Feeling hamstrung by Jackie's refusal to go to authorities, Duffin said that days later he sought advice from his dorm's resident assistant. Careful not to mention Jackie by name, so the RA wouldn't be obligated to contact police, he said he asked if he should call police even though Jackie didn't want him to. The RA told Duffin that he should encourage Jackie to talk with police, but that Duffin couldn't force her to do so.<br /> <br /> The RA, who asked not to be named, confirmed Duffin's story to the AP.

"The One Habit of Successful People Those Lists Forget to Mention"	"There's a thing all of those lists of productivity habits always forget to mention.<br /> <br /> You know, we all love to read them. Ten things all successful people do. Top eight habits of highly-productive people. Top tips for best-selling authors. <br /> <br /> But whether we are talking about tips that give us a road map to creative or business success, or <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-bartolotta/happiness-tips_b_3956114.html  target= _hplink >tips to live a happier life, </a>there's one key thing all of these lists neglect to mention:<br /> <br /> <strong>We must experiment.</strong><br /> <br /> We look at these lists because we feel some gap between where we are and where we want to be, and we've become convinced that the solution is finding out what works for someone else and duplicating their efforts. The thing all those successful/productive/magically shiny people have in common isn't that they all did the same thing. They found what worked best <em>for them.<br /> </em><br /> <br /> Perhaps you've heard the story about the young woman and the ham.<br /> <br /> The story goes like this: A young woman was preparing a ham for a holiday dinner, and as she had always seen her mother do, she cut off the end of the ham before putting it in the oven. A friend observing her do this asked why she had cut off the end, and it made her pause; she didn't know. It was just what she had always seen her mother do. So, she asked her mother... why do we cut off the end of the ham? Her mother thought about this for a bit before realizing that she didn't know why it was done, just that she had always seen her mother do it that way. Curiosity getting the best of her, she telephoned her mother and asked. The grandmother laughed and replied that when she first married, they had a tiny oven; without slicing the end off of the ham, it wouldn't fit.<br /> <br /> <strong>How much time do we waste on doing things simply because it's how they've always been done?</strong><br /> <br /> If we believe that part of the creative process is about making something new and effecting change, we must stop doing things the way they've always been done and begin to experiment.<br /> <br /> For a long time, I tried to force myself to do  morning pages  and thought there was something wrong with my writing process when that felt uncomfortable. Writing first thing in the day works best for many people. But if I want to write what I need to write -- what the world needs me to write -- I need to find my own process instead of trying to slice of the end of the ham and fit my writing into a pattern, just because it worked for another writer. Maybe you write best in a coffee shop; maybe you need to be at home. Maybe inspiration hits you most often at night and working in the morning feels like drudgery. While there is something to be said for pushing and challenging ourselves, the key is that we experiment -- we get curious -- instead of trying merely to do what worked best for someone else.<br /> <br /> We know inherently that we need to take the proverbial road less travelled, to cut our own paths if we want to make a difference in the world. And yet, we fall into that trap of insanity trying the same old thing and expecting new results. Is it worth listening to and learning from others about the tools and habits they find useful? Absolutely. It ceases to be useful when we treat it as dogma and become frustrated or stifled by trying to make someone else's process our own.<br /> <br /> As we wind down 2014 and look ahead to next year, it's a good time to take stock of where we are, how far we've come, and the tools we've used to get here.<br /> <br /> This month, may you let go of doing what's always been done if it has ceased to serve. May you widen your eyes with curiosity instead of fear at the approaching new year. And may you look at each blank page, empty stage, clean canvas and new day as the beginning of a grand experiment.

"Learning With Eckhart Tolle: Geneen Roth and the Power of Enoughness"	"On any given day, Geneen Roth spends a considerable amount of time listening to people question their own actions. People often arrive at her popular retreats feeling fed up, depressed, ignored, and just plain not good enough.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-ScreenShot20140324at8.21.18AM.png ><img alt= 2014-12-12-ScreenShot20140324at8.21.18AM.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-ScreenShot20140324at8.21.18AM-thumb.png  width= 570  height= 570  /></a><br /> <br /> Her students' lives are deeply affected by what she refers to as  not-enoughness,  especially when it comes to food and money. They worry about whether they are thin enough. They worry about whether or not they have enough money, or even worry that they have too much. They worry about the shame, greed and pain associated with money and its effects on their lives. Geneen explains that,  once you internalize that lack of sufficiency, and you tell yourself that you don't have enough value, overeating and shopping become a substitute for that feeling of enoughness. <br /> <br /> Geneen understands these worries deeply. The best-selling author of <em>Women Food and God and Lost and Found</em>, she has an intrinsic and heartfelt empathy for her students' perceptions, grounded in her 17 years of struggling with eating disorders and then her own dramatic and sudden reversal of financial wealth. <br /> <br /> In 2008, Geneen was affected by an investment debacle linked to the actions of one of the most respected financiers in the United States at the time: Bernie Madoff. Perpetuating a fraud called  extraordinarily evil,   unprecedented  and  staggering  by the judge in the resultant criminal trial, Madoff was responsible for the loss of US$20B of his clients' funds. Geneen was one of those clients. When Madoff's Ponzi scheme was exposed, 30 years' worth of Geneen's own life's savings were gone in an instant. As she says,  I didn't even have the money to pay the mortgage. I didn't know how we were going to live and where we were going to live. <br /> <br /> In our time together, Geneen repeatedly points out that although her newest book centers on money, she is not a financial expert. Her goal in <a href= http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Found-Womans-Losing-Finding/dp/0452297761/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1330557351&sr=1-1  target= _hplink ><em>Lost and Found</em></a>, instead, was to explore the meaning of money in our lives and why most of us feel that we can't get enough. Using her own financial crisis as a touchstone for that exploration, Geneen explains that it was the intensity of her experience that forced her to reside in the present moment. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-ScreenShot20141211at7.32.38PM.png ><img alt= 2014-12-12-ScreenShot20141211at7.32.38PM.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-ScreenShot20141211at7.32.38PM-thumb.png  width= 360  height= 247  /></a><br /> <br /> Unpredictably, her loss presented her with the gift of joy, peace, and contentment. As she describes this transition, her financial breakdown was what Eckhart Tolle calls a critical limit situation: not a life-threatening catastrophe, but given the scale of what could happen to a person on a daily basis, overwhelming. Geneen says that,  I was fortunate enough to have people in my life who guided me back to the understand that nothing of value had been lost -- although, in the first few days, I said to each of them that  now is not the time to be spiritual!  <br /> <br /> Within days after the fraud was revealed, however, Geneen perceived that there was no challenge, critical or not, that had the power to obstruct her connection to the present moment and to her spiritual foundation. As she explains,  I saw that very quickly; I was able to understand the truth. Whenever I started blaming myself and others, I was able to bring myself back to this moment, to now, and when I did, I saw that nothing was wrong. <br /> <br /> As Geneen explains, we often compartmentalize the idea of money and the idea of consciousness separately, which results in a lack of awareness about how we use and manage money. We can all suffer from this challenge, whether or not we know it is happening. <br /> <br /> For example, Geneen demonstrates that, for some of us, eating and shopping are the only ways that we allow ourselves to have what we want. At the same time, since it's not food or consumer goods we truly need, we end up feeling empty. This sense of insufficiency frustrates our efforts to feel good about ourselves. Nothing we eat, buy or own is likely to fill that void if we feel that we not enough, or if we feel that we are not valued.<br /> <br /> Awareness about money doesn't mean that we have to turn to self-repression or self-indulgence, however. Instead, Geneen suggests that we can use our relationship with money as a doorway to awareness. When we suffer hardships, as Geneen has, we are more inclined to pay attention, but building awareness is something that we need to work towards no matter what we experience in life. <br /> <br /> As she explains,  There isn't a situation that has the power to determine or to take away our focus on presence.  Geneen writes that there is something better than the illusion of safety that money creates, which involves  knowing your own mind, contacting your own heart. Telling the truth. Being willing to be uncomfortable. Understanding that feelings won't kill you. <br /> <br /> There is a deep connection between Eckhart Tolle's core teachings and the real-life challenges explored in Geneen Roth's nine books. Her first-hand accounts of her own journey towards consciousness bring Eckhart's teachings to life. Thirty years of writing and sharing her personal narrative, and teaching both in person and through her online retreats, have given Geneen a depth of experience in understanding the practical barriers that prevent us from finding presence. <br /> <br /> As Geneen told me, the first step to consciousness is:  Be interested. Pay attention with kindness. Be curious and open.  <br /> <br /> She knows that in developing consciousness, change may be slow, but as Geneen says, the possibilities are both endless and exhilarating.

"The Emperor's New Calories: Why Everything You Know About Dieting Is Wrong"	"As a dietitian in New York City I see a large variety of clients. From African Americans with Type 2 diabetes to Hasidic Jews with obesity and everything in between. They all may not have much in common socially, economically or culturally, but as for dieting they all seem to have the same story. I have come to believe that we as a nation think that wellness and balance is out of reach, that we must count calories day in and day out in order to achieve any sense of health. I am here to call this falsehood out and to dethrone this excessive wellness concept that has ruled for much too long.  <br /> <br /> America is obsessed with weight and wellness, yet the more fanatical we became the bigger we get. In <a href= http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity_adult_07_08/obesity_adult_07_08.pdf  target= _hplink >1960 approximately 13 percent</a> of Americans were classified as obese; however, through the aerobics-crazed '80s and the present day smoothie infatuation the <a href= http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity_adult_07_08/obesity_adult_07_08.pdf  target= _hplink >percentage has gone up to 34</a>.<br /> <br /> The story I hear repeated daily from different clients struggling with weight and nutrition-related diseases is as follows:  I wanted to lose weigh,t so I ate a lot less and l couldn't maintain it and have gained the weight back plus a little extra.  I look at my clients and can feel their frustration, anger and desperation. They can't seem to win no matter what they do. They have tried it all from the grapefruit diet to eating only one meal a day to the shakes. It is a never-ending cycle of failure that just breeds more failure. <br /> <br /> It's not about eating less, people, it's about eating more. Yes, I dare to say it, eat, eat, eat! Of course I am not saying you should get crazy on a full bucket of fried chicken or a massive bowl of nachos, but you should learn to enjoy and to eat. Caloric restriction may lead to a feeling of un-satisfaction followed by an episode of excessive junk food consumption. To eat responsibly means that you have a positive relationship with food. Food is a joyous and wonderful part of life and should be experienced. The three keys to wellness are education, access and inspiration. <br /> <br /> Nutrition education starts with understanding what food is. Food can be broken down into six categories, three of them being energy-yielding: carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Understanding what food is allows you to understand portion control and how to choose healthy options for long-term successful nourishment. Learning about the basics of nutrition is an excellent start to wellness. I recently had a client come in that didn't know what type of diabetes she had even though she had been diagnosed over a decade ago. Many of my clients don't know what a calorie is and are overall very confused about nutrition. With a little bit of education both of them are on track and working towards their nutrition goals. Education empowers you to begin to make healthy choices that will impact you for years to come. <br /> <br /> Access, yes, there is a connection between poverty and obesity, but we must choose to be resourceful and use what we have to create a healthy lifestyle. Last year I worked with a client in a battered women's shelter who ate the food distributed by the food panty in her faculty and then added nutrient-dense products to the meal to add more nutritional value. With a little nutritional consulting she was unstoppable on her path to success. I thought to myself that if this woman can work toward eating healthy while living in one of the most difficult situations, so can others. <br /> <br /> Finally, inspiration is the workhorse of the three keys to wellness. We must be inspired by the world around us, our loved ones and the possibility of the future.  I am most inspired by one of my anorexic clients who struggled daily with her body image and dysmorphic disorder. Over the year we worked together I watched her fight to gain just a few pounds and strive for wellness. She would tell me throughout our sessions about the goal of enjoying a simple pasta dinner. She described the dishes, the ingredients, and the smells of the food cooking. Over time she learned <br /> that if she wanted something badly enough and had the right support she could change her behavior and overcome anything.  <br /> <br /> To be healthy we must first desire it, we must want it so bad that we are willing to do the work to achieve it. We are all busy and tired but we must be stirred by desire, determination and tenacity to believe that we deserve to be healthy. Isn't it finally time to get off this merry go round of misinformation and enjoy the rest of this crazy carnival called life? "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 23:41:11 -0500"	"healthy"
"This One Thing Will Create More Abundance in Your Life Immediately"	"<center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-05-_MG_5567.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-05-_MG_5567.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-05-_MG_5567-thumb.jpg  width= 380  height= 570  /></a></center><br /> <br /> Most people think of the word abundance in terms of wealth. However, abundance is much broader than just the financial aspect, it is all that is from Spirit, such as joy, peace, love, enthusiasm, forgiveness, acceptance, happiness. Abundance manifests in our lives in the form of relationships, health, finances, career, personal and spiritual growth.<br /> <br /> <strong>I believe that we create in our lives as they were a white canvas that we were to paint. With our thoughts, beliefs, actions and feelings we create our reality.</strong><br /> <br /> I've been applying the principles of manifesting abundance for the last 10 years of my life and I can say from experience that it does work, we are co-creators with Spirit. I now live a life beyond my wildest dreams: I do what I love for a living and I have a sense of inner peace and fulfillment I had never experienced before. Abundance manifests in my life daily and I would like to share with you how you can tune in Abundance as well.<br /> <br /> There are a few keys that open the flow of abundance into our lives, but if I were to choose one and only one, the key that opens us to abundance immediately is Gratitude.<br /> <br /> <strong>Gratitude keeps the flow of abundance coming to us.</strong><br /> <br /> If we don't count our blessings, we will stop the flow of receiving wonderful gifts into our lives in any way, shape or form.<br /> <br /> I will share with you two ways in which you can apply gratitude into your daily life in order to move into more abundance:<br /> <br /> The first is to be grateful for what we want, even before we get it. An ancient teacher said, <em> Ask as if it has already been given. </em><br /> <br /> So, how are we asking? Are we demanding or are we allowing? When we say,  <em> Please give me that perfect job, pleeease, </em> are we asking as if it has already been given?<br /> <br /> Instead, we should say:<br /> <br /> <em> Universe, Source, thank you so much for that perfect job that serves me, I am so grateful for your blessings.  </em><br /> <br /> This is an expansive, grateful way of asking. Just see how the energy moves in you and how you feel when you ask as if it has already been given. You start living the feeling and believing that this perfect job belongs to you. Guess what? The Universe will bring it to you because you now created the knowing of the perfect job being in your life right now.<br /> <br /> The second way to bring about abundance through gratitude in a financial way,  is through what I call  Bless the money. <br /> <br /> <strong>Remember, money is not separated from Spirit, as everything is from Spirit anyway. Instead of fearing or judging money for itself, why don't we invite Spirit in, to participate in our finances and all other areas of our lives?</strong><br /> <br /> So how can we  Bless the Money ? Every time we spend money, or we receive money or cash or write a check, no matter if it's pennies or hundreds of dollars, we bless the money to expand it.<br /> <br /> We do it with gratitude first. Specifically, when we spend in the grocery store or while we pump gas in our cars we can say:<br /> <em><br />  Thank you so much for the abundance that you bring into my life, that I can have gas in my car to go where I want to go. Let your blessings of abundance expand through me today, that the next person that comes here, feels your abundance. Let this money multiply by hundreds for me and for everybody that comes here today. </em><br /> <br /> This action of blessing the money will make you spend in joy and creativity instead of spending in an energy of lack and contraction.<br /> <br /> <strong>To summarize:</strong><br /> <br /> <ul><li>Remember to be grateful for what you have now and for what you want to bring into your lives.</li><br /> <li>Bless the money when you spend the next time, and see how it feels inside and how it moves in you.</li><br /> <li>When you ask for Abundance, always ask as if it has already been given, and it will come to you by default if it was meant to be for your highest good.</li></ul><br /> <br /> Please comment below and tell me:<br /> <br /> <strong>What are you most grateful for in your life today?<br /> <br /> After reading this article, is there a new way you might apply gratitude in your daily life?</strong><br /> <br /> <em>If you want to learn even more about Abundance and gain clarity in your life, I'm hosting a <a href= http://mercedesmaidana.com/a-great-opportunity-to-get-clarity-for-2015/  target= _hplink >Live Mastermind event in Austin, TX on December 12</a>.

"How Do You Know When Something Is Right?"	"<em>This post originally appeared on <a href= http://brandmentalist.com  target= _hplink >BrandMentalist.com</a></em><br /> <br /> Do you know that moment when things just feel right -- whether's it's a job, a friend, or a lover?<br /> <br /> A lot of the time we try to justify things in our head. We interpret things to be the way we want them to be... to go the way we want them to go. Sometimes our head gets clouded by our heart, triggered by our emotions.<br /> <br /> And every once in a blue moon, things just feel right -- so damn right -- that you wonder how it happens and if it could happen again over and over as if you're trying to find the formula for it. <br /> <br /> <strong><h3>1. You have no doubt.</h3></strong><br /> <br /> Doubt occurs, more or less, on almost a constant basis. Very rarely you have no doubt -- no doubt at all -- in what you do. <br /> <br /> When you've found something that's right for you, you have absolutely no doubt. You're instantly and continuously in the flow. You move forward without hesitation and questions. You don't need an affirmation from another person to assure you that what you've got going is right. You just know it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Following your heart becomes easy. In fact, it becomes a natural process for you. Your eyes light up when you talk about that object. You smile when you think about it.</strong><br /> <br /> Whenever you're free, that's what you want to do. You feel sure, confident, and secure like never before. You're not scared because there's no doubt and fear that make you wonder  what if  because there's no  what if.   <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-06-followyourhearthuffpostt01.png ><img alt= 2014-12-06-followyourhearthuffpostt01.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-06-followyourhearthuffpostt01-thumb.png  width= 556  height= 570  /></a><br /> <br /> <strong><h3>2. You are completely yourself and you feel happy.</h3></strong><br /> <br /> There are several things we have to put up with in life -- be it subjects we hate, colleagues we don't get along with, or tasks we don't enjoy doing.<br /> <br /> But when you've found something that's right for you, there's no need to compromise. You enjoy every bit of it. The difficult tasks become a fun challenge.<br /> <br /> <strong>You're completely who you are, doing what you do, and you just feel happy. You feel content. It's happiness from the inside out, not outside in. You feel like you've found your purpose in life. Your life now has a meaning. You feel rich -- from within. </strong><br /> <br /> <strong><h3>3. You become more focused.</h3></strong><br /> <br /> Being focused is hard. We all have a tendency to say  yes  rather than  no.  But when you've found something that's right for you, nothing else matters. That right thing has become your main focus without questions. Your heart says yes. Your mind says yes. Your body says yes.<br /> <br /> <strong>You have never been happier saying no to other tempting distractions before because you know you have found the right one and you don't want to waste time focusing on other things. </strong><br /> <br /> You wake up thinking about that thing when you wake up. You can easily get into the zone without trying. You can read up on such topic for hours without feeling like it's hard work. Focus becomes easier because you have found what's right for you. Your intellect and emotion become in sync. Regardless of road bumps, life has never been more fulfilling. <br /> <br /> <strong><h3>4. You look forward to every day.</h3></strong><br /> <br /> Waking up to work every morning, hitting the snooze button over and over can be daunting -- typing away in front of the screen, putting up with small talks while making yourself a cup of tea. When you've found something that's right for you, there's no question that you look forward to going to bed simply because you look forward to fast forwarding time to when you wake up and simply starting another exciting day. You feel excited. Your life is filled with euphoria.<br /> <br /> <strong>You live life with your arms wide open and look forward to what life's going to throw at you. You feel like you can't live your life any other way.</strong><br /> <br /> Even struggles seem all right, because you know no matter what, you will find a way out because you simply love every day of your life and everything is going to be okay. <br /> <br /> <strong><h3>5. You feel inspired.</h3></strong><br /> <br /> When you've found something that's right for you, you want to be better without force. You get this instant internal drive and motivation to become a better person, to do better work, and to achieve greater things. You feel inspired. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-06-fallinlovehuffpost01.png ><img alt= 2014-12-06-fallinlovehuffpost01.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-06-fallinlovehuffpost01-thumb.png  width= 556  height= 570  /></a><br /> <br /> You start seeing the world in a slightly different way. You start to be more curious and discover more things. You want to learn more and feel like you can't get enough of this world.<br /> <br /> <strong>It's because you've found something that's right for you that has opened the door to your heart to the world filled with inspiration and beauty.</strong><br /> <br /> You're now restored with reasonable hope that injects you with a hint of creativity. Inspiration is a wonderful thing. And when you're constantly inspired, life never feels the same again. <br /> <br /> Just like what Steve Jobs said... <br /> <br /> <blockquote>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.</blockquote><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-06-turnpassionhuffpost01.png ><img alt= 2014-12-06-turnpassionhuffpost01.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-06-turnpassionhuffpost01-thumb.png  width= 570  height= 415  /></a><br /> <br /> --<br /> <br /> <em>Mo is the owner of the famous inspirational blog -- <a href= http://brandmentalist.com  target= _hplink >BrandMentalist.com</a>.

"'60 Minutes' Examines The Benefits Of Mindfulness"	"Anderson Cooper dove headfirst into the world of mindfulness in a segment <a href= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/anderson-cooper-plugs-in-to-mindfulness/  target= _hplink >on Sunday night's  60 Minutes </a>.<br /> <br />  This is just the next generation of exercise, we’ve got the physical, you know, exercise components down, and now it’s about working out how can we actually train our minds,  Dr. Judson Brewer told Cooper of mindfulness. Dr. Brewer is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the University of Massachusetts.<br /> <br /> Cooper attended a mindfulness retreat and learned about the benefits of meditation, then met with Dr. Brewer and saw that the benefits of meditation are clearly visible via neurological measurements. After thinking of something anxiety-provoking, Cooper begins meditating and on-screen instruments show brain cells instantly reacting to the mindfulness technique.<br /> <br /> As Cooper explains, “Dr. Brewer believes everyone can train their brains to reach that blue mindfulness zone. But he says all the technology we’re surrounded by makes it difficult.”<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Watch the clip from  60 Minutes  above (via CBS)</strong></em> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 18:54:22 -0500"	"healthy"
"Sony Demands News Outlets Stop Publishing Information From Leaked Documents"	"By Lisa Richwine<br /> <br /> LOS ANGELES, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Sony Pictures Entertainment told certain news organizations on Sunday to stop publishing information contained in documents stolen by hackers who attacked the movie studio's computer network last month, three media groups reported.<br /> <br /> The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter and Variety published stories reporting that they had each received a letter from David Boies, an attorney for Sony, demanding that the outlets stop reporting information contained in the documents and immediately destroy them.<br /> <br /> The studio  does not consent to your possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading or making any use  of the information, Boies wrote in the letter, according to the New York Times report.<br /> <br /> A Sony spokesman had no comment on the reports. Representatives for Variety and The Hollywood Reporter could not immediately be reached via email on Sunday.<br /> <br /> New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said:  Any decisions about whether or how to use any of the information will take into account both the significance of the news and the questions of how the information emerged and who has access to it. <br /> <br /> A spokesman for Boies confirmed he sent a letter to certain media outlets on behalf of Sony but declined to discuss details.<br /> <br /> Disclosures from the internal documents have caused turmoil at the studio, a unit of Japan's Sony Corp, and shed light on internal discussions key to the company's future. For instance, the unidentified hackers have released troves of documents that include employee salaries and financial information, marketing plans and contracts with business partners.<br /> <br /> In addition, the documents that have emerged included an exchange in which Co-Chairman Amy Pascal joked about President Barack Obama's race. After media outlets reported that, Pascal subsequently issued a public apology for  insensitive and inappropriate  emails.<br /> <br /> Pascal is scheduled to meet this week with civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, whose spokeswoman says he is weighing whether to call for her resignation. Pascal did not respond to a request for comment, and a Sony spokeswoman declined to comment on Pascal's future.<br /> <br /> Sony, in a memo to staff seen by Reuters on Dec. 2, acknowledged that a large amount of data was stolen by the hackers but has declined to confirm specific documents.<br /> <br /> Over the weekend, a message claiming to be from the Guardians of Peace, a group that says it carried out the cyber attack on Sony, warned of additional disclosures.<br /> <br />  We are preparing for you a Christmas gift,  said the message posted on a site for sharing files called Pastebin.  The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting.  (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Edmund Klamann) "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 00:00:31 -0500"	"entertainment"

"5 Standout Moments From Z100's Jingle Ball 2014"	"With an all-star lineup that boasted just about every major pop star on the radio in 2014, z100's Jingle Ball at Madison Square Garden in New York on Friday was a great refresher of the biggest hits of the year. Here are 5 standout moments from the night: <br /> <br /> <big><strong>1. Sam Smith's Acoustic Performance Of  Latch </strong></big> <br /> <br /> From the moment Smith took the stage, the British singer captivated the entire arena with his soulful voice and heartfelt ballads. Though  Stay With Me  and  I'm Not The Only One  had everyone in the place a little teary-eyed, his acoustic performance of  Latch  is what really gave the crowd goosebumps. The stripped down rendition of the dance hit by Disclosure made the song even more amazing. <br /> <br /> <iframe width= 570  height= 312  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/-XNLhIcISVc  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe><br /> <br /> <big><strong>2. Ariana Grande Handled A Minor Trip-up Like A Boss </strong></big><br /> <br /> Ariana Grande is one of the biggest names in music this year, and all eyes were on her as she belted out her latest radio smash,  Love Me Harder.  Unfortunately, that meant that the whole audience saw her trip as she walked across the stage. But the way she handled the stumble only made the performance more memorable.<br /> <br />  Woo, girl! I almost died up here,  she laughed, before carrying on with the performance. The 21-year-old proved again that she could laugh at herself when she <a href= http://instagram.com/p/wkhoI5yWbi/?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=video&modal=true  target= _hplink >posted the video to her Instagram account</a> the following day: <br /> <br /> <blockquote class= instagram-media  data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version= 4  style=  background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px); ><div style= padding:8px; > <div style=  background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%; > <div style=  background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px; ></div></div> <p style=  margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px; > <a href= https://instagram.com/p/wkhoI5yWbi/  style=  color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;  target= _top >when u slip on confetti & almost die at madison square garden  </a></p> <p style=  color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap; >Un vídeo publicado por Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) el <time style=  font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;  datetime= 2014-12-14T02:40:26+00:00 >Dic 12, 2014 at 6:40 PST</time></p></div></blockquote><br /> <script async defer src= //platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js ></script><br /> <br><br /> <br /> <big><strong>3. Lil Jon Showed Up in A Santa Suit</big></strong> <br /> <br /> Thanks to this guy, the most frequently asked question of the year was  Turn down for what?  At Jingle Ball, Lil Jon proved once again that he turns down for absolutely nothing and no one, as he hit the stage in a Santa Suit to introduce  5 Seconds Of Summer.  <br /> <br /> <img alt= lil jon  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2390430/thumbs/o-LIL-JON-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> <big><strong>4. Nick Jonas Brought An Enviable Posse</big></strong> <br /> <br /> Okay Jonas, now we're the ones who are  jealous.  His performance of the hit song was a standout moment of the night, thanks to the backing of a Gospel choir who sang along with him. That was the only song Jonas had on the set list for the evening, but it was a major takeaway from the event. <br /> <br /> <iframe width= 570  height= 312  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/H00tqio71fU  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe><br /> <br /> <big><strong>5. Taylor Swift Invited Us To Her Birthday Party</big></strong> <br /> <br /> Arguably the biggest star of the show, Swift was the last performer of the night, and the singer was ready to go out with a bang. After performing  Welcome To New York,   We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together  and  Blank Space,  to an audience that was belting out every word along with her, Swift was sure to announce that her birthday was just a few minutes away as the clock neared midnight. She then finished up with  I Knew You Were Trouble  and  Shake It Off,  as the evening officially turned into her birthday bash. So yes, technically HuffPost Entertainment was at Taylor Swift's 25th birthday party. <br /> <br /> <img alt= taylor swift  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2390434/thumbs/o-TAYLOR-SWIFT-570.jpg?11  /> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 15:52:29 -0500"	"entertainment"
"Joseph Scott Pemberton, U.S. Marine, Charged With Murder Of Transgender Woman In Philippines"	"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A Philippine government prosecutor says a detained U.S. Marine has been charged with murder in the killing of a Filipino transgender.<br /> <br /> Prosecutor Emily de los Santos said Monday there was  probable cause  that Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton killed Jennifer Laude, whose former name was Jeffrey, in a motel room, where  the victim's body was found in October in Olongapo city, northwest of Manila. She had apparently been drowned in a toilet bowl. The emotional case reignited a debate over custody of American military personnel accused of crimes. But the looming irritant between the treaty allies over Pemberton's custody was eased after Washington agreed to move him from a U.S. warship to a Philippine camp, where he remained under American custody with an outer ring of Filipino guards."

"Texas Cop Nathanial Robinson Uses Stun Gun On Elderly Man Over Inspection Sticker"	"A Texas cop is under investigation after <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVNwPD7CPR8  target= _hplink >using a stun gun on an elderly man</a> he had stopped for an inspection sticker issue that the officer himself apparently didn't understand. <br /> <br /> Dashcam <a href= http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/12/goddamned-nazi-stormtrooper-texas-cop-tasers-76-year-old-man-with-expired-inspection/  target= _hplink >video from the incident posted by Raw Story</a>, above, shows officer Nathanial Robinson, 23, pull over Pete Vasquez, 76, at Adam's Auto Mart in Victoria, Texas, as  <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7UdgT2QfwA  target= _hplink >Under Ground Kings</a>  by Drake blares from the cruiser's radio. <br /> <br /> Vasquez gets out of the car, walks behind it and gestures toward the license plate and to the office of the dealer, where he works. He later told the Victoria Advocate newspaper that <a href= https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2014/dec/13/victoria-police-officer-investigated-for-tasing-dr/  target= _hplink >he was explaining that the dealer tags on the car make it exempt from inspection</a>.<br /> <br /> Victoria <a href= https://www2.victoriatx.org/police/vpddirectory/officerbios/ChiefJeffCraigBio.asp  target= _hplink >Police Chief Jeffrey  J.J.  Craig</a> confirmed to the paper that the car was exempt. <br /> <br /> On the video, however, Robinson appears to try to snatch a piece of paper from Vasquez without success. Then, he grabs Vasquez's arm, twists it behind him and pushes him against the hood of the cruiser. After a brief scuffle, the cop reaches for both of Vasquez's arms and drags him the ground, out of camera range. <br /> <br /> When the cop is next seen in frame, he's yelling and holding up a stun gun. <br /> <br /> Police told the newspaper that Robinson used the device twice on Vasquez. <br /> <br /> A man emerges from the dealer's office and yells at the cop. <br /> <br />  I told the officer, 'What in the hell are you doing?' This gentleman is 76 years old,  sales manager Larry Urich told the newspaper.  The cop told me to stand back, but I didn't shut up. I told him he was a goddamn Nazi Stormtrooper. <br /> <br /> When other officers arrive on the scene, they ask Vasquez for his side of the story and check to see if he's injured. <br /> <br />  Are you hurting anywhere?  the unidentified officer can be heard asking on the video. <br /> <br />  Not yet,  Vasquez replies.  Probably later on. I'm 76 years old. <br /> <br /> Vasquez was taken to a hospital, then released without being cited. <br /> <br /> Craig later apologized to Vasquez. <br /> <br />  Public trust is extremely important to us,  Craig said, according to the Advocate.  Sometimes that means you have to take a real hard look at some of the actions that occur within the department. <br /> <br /> He told The Associated Press that <a href= http://abc13.com/news/chief-officer-used-stun-gun-on-76-year-old-driver/436551/  target= _hplink >Robinson has been placed on administrative duty pending an investigation</a>.<br /> <br /> District attorney Stephen Tyler told the paper he hasn't been contacted by police yet, but said the officer could face charges including official oppression, injury to elderly, aggravated assault and assault. <br /> <br /> As many took to the department's Facebook page to express their concern, the agency posted a response reiterating that the incident is under investigation.<br /> <br />  We place incredible value in public trust and have worked diligently to build that trust.

"The Ezell Ford Autopsy Report Casts Another Glare on the Autopsy Debate"	"The slaying of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Ezell Ford have one other thing in common other than they were unarmed black males slain by police officers and their killings ignited a national furor. Their autopsies have been the subject of intense scrutiny, debate, controversy and disbelief. Prosecutors and family attorneys heatedly dueled over the two Brown autopsies, one official, and one independent that proved and disproved whether Brown was shot and killed after an in close battle with Darren Wilson or at a distance. The Garner and Rice killings were both ruled a homicide based on their autopsy findings. Yet the ruling and the autopsy findings weren't enough to sway a prosecutor and a grand jury to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo who killed Garner. There's absolutely no guarantee that the autopsy report and ruling in Rice's case will force an indictment of the Cleveland cop that killed him either. <br /> <br /> Now there's Ezell Ford. Virtually the instant the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner completed a preliminary autopsy on the Ford killing the LAPD sought and got an  administrative hold  on the public release of the autopsy's result. This outraged civil rights leaders and Ford family members screamed that the freeze on release was a clumsy attempt to cover-up and whitewash Ford's killing, LAPD officials countered that the hold was simply to prevent  tainting  the investigation with after the fact witness testimony.<br /> <br /> The autopsy is crucial to the case but it is guaranteed to raise as many questions as it seeks to answer. One question is exactly what will the Ford autopsy show? The other is what if it backs the officer's version that Ford was killed after a struggle or it contradicts it and shows as some witness's claim he was on the ground and not resisting? Yet another is will it really prove anything or simply stir more controversy and skepticism about it whichever way it goes?<br /> <br /> The reason for skepticism is probably the easiest to understand. Autopsies are performed by county medical examiners and even with competent and professional medical examiners, police and prosecutors may exert undue influence on their findings by sharing theories of a crime or information about a suspect, which may lead pathologists to tailor their conclusions to fit the theory of law enforcement officials rather than the facts of a case. This was tested to the limit in the Brown slaying. His family believed that the St. Louis County Medical Examiner was so in lock step with police officials that they didn't trust the examiner to objectively present any facts about the cause of Brown's death that would fly in the face of the version given by police. They got a private autopsy and not surprisingly it contradicted the official version of the killing. Then it quickly became a case of dueling autopsies that purported to show different versions of how Brown died at Wilson's hands.<br /> <br /> This points to the problem of what and how an autopsy is conducted. A number of chief medical examiners, even official examiners, have been fiercely critical of the entire autopsy process. Glenn Larkin, a former chief medical examiner in Pennsylvania, quipped that with an autopsy  We're one step removed from God and St. Michael.  His point was that an autopsy even when there is no controversy or charge of bias hardly provides fool proof evidence of how a death occurred.  Autopsy critics point to questionable forensic methodology such as bullet lead comparison, dog scent lineups, bite mark comparison, and even fingerprint and DNA analysis. In other cases, medical examiners apparently have made up their  expert  conclusions, which have no scientific basis.<br /> <br /> Constantine Gatsonis, director of the Center for Statistical Sciences at Brown University and co-chair of the committee that authored a National Academy of Sciences report on flaws in autopsy reporting noted.  Much research is needed not only to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of current forensic methods but also to innovate and develop them further.  <br /> <br /> It makes little difference how erroneous or flawed an autopsy is the likelihood that it will be questioned is slim precisely because is viewed as an incontrovertible scientific medical examination. It ignores the fact that in many cases a pathologist's determination as to how a person died is simply an opinion.  <br /> <br /> A completely unbiased, untainted, factual autopsy that directly brands a death in an officer involved shooting as a homicide becomes a moot exercise if judges, juries and even defense attorneys ignore the findings even when there is clear evidence of improper influence by police or prosecutors.<br /> <br /> The Ezell Ford autopsy may be the paragon of medical scientific accuracy and tell exactly how Ford was killed and support or contradict the LAPD version of the killing. But that will hardly be the end of it. It will simply cast another glare on the autopsy debate.<br /> <br /> --<br /> <br /> <em>Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

"Friends Say They Pushed UVA 'Jackie' To Call Cops"	"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Three friends of an alleged victim of a gang rape at a University of Virginia frat house told The Associated Press that a magazine article that used the woman's attack to paint a picture of a culture of sexual violence on college campuses was wrong on a number of key points: most important that they didn't encourage her to report the attack and that they were more concerned about their reputations than her well-being.<br /> <br /> One of the friends, a 20-year-old, third-year student referred to as  Randall  in the Rolling Stone article but whose real name is Ryan Duffin, told the AP that not only did he encourage the alleged victim to go to police, but he started to dial 9-1-1 on his cellphone until she begged off saying she just wanted to go back to her dorm and go to sleep.<br /> <br />  I couldn't help but notice that everything that the article said about me was incorrect,  Duffin said.<br /> <br /> The Rolling Stone article set off an intense debate about sexual violence, alcohol, fraternities, and journalism ethics.<br /> <br /> The Associated Press also spoke with the other two friends portrayed in the article: third-year, 20-year-old U.Va. students Kathryn Hendley and Alex Stock, known as  Cindy  and  Andy  in the article. None of the three friends was contacted by the Rolling Stone's reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, before the article was published; each of them rejected multiple assertions made in the article, which has since been retracted.<br /> <br /> All three say Erdely has since reached out to them, and Hendley told the AP Erdely apologized to her for portraying her the way she did.<br /> <br /> The three friends say they continue to work on correcting the record about what happened that night, and at least one, Duffin, wonders to what extent he believes the victim's own version of what happened — or whether any discrepancies in her story matter.<br /> <br />  People at U.Va. want answers just as much as I do,  Duffin says.  But if anything, the takeaway from all this is that I still don't really care if what's presented in this article is true or not because I think it's far more important that people focus on the issue of sexual assault as a whole. <br /> <br /> Other news media have also interviewed the friends but this is the first time each of them agreed to allow their full names to be used. A lawyer representing the victim, who has been identified only as  Jackie,  has declined several requests by the AP to interview Jackie and did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article; the AP does not typically name alleged victims of sexual assault.<br /> <br /> The Rolling Stone article, published last month, described a culture of sexual violence hiding in plain sight at U.Va. The article has roiled the campus and caused a huge backlash, with U.Va. suspending fraternity activities until January, the Board of Visitors appointing an independent investigator to look into the allegations and the university handing the case over to the Charlottesville police.<br /> <br /> The main focus of the piece is an alleged gang rape that Jackie said happened on Sept. 28, 2012, during her first semester on campus. In the article, she said she had gone out on a date with a classmate named  Drew,  who later that night lured her into a secluded room at a frat house. Once inside the room, she said, she was raped by a group of seven fraternity brothers while her date and one other man watched.<br /> <br /> As described in the Rolling Stone article, a distraught Jackie met her three friends at a picnic table in the shadows of the frat house and tearfully told them what had happened.<br /> <br /> While the article said Duffin suggested they take her to the hospital, it described Stock and Hendley as carrying on a debate about what would happen to her reputation and theirs should word get out.<br /> <br />  The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackie's rape, while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress, wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep, forgetful sleep,  the article said.  Detached, Jackie listened as Cindy prevailed over the group: 'She's gonna be the girl who cried rape, and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again.' <br /> <br /> However, Hendley told the AP that not only did she not say any of that, she had arrived with Stock to the picnic table only to have Jackie say she didn't want her to be part of the conversation. She said she watched from afar while Stock and Duffin talked with Jackie.<br /> <br /> Stock confirmed this account.<br /> <br /> As described by Duffin to the AP, this is what happened: He had returned home from a party when he got a call from Jackie. He left to meet her and she was sitting on the top of a picnic table outside U.Va.'s Tuttle-Dunnington dorm. She was shaking and  it looked like she had been crying,  Duffin said.  Her lip was quivering, her eyes were darting around. And right then, I put two and two together. I knew she had been on this date and people don't usually look like that after a date. <br /> <br /> Jackie eventually told Duffin her version of what she said had happened that night: that she was gang raped at a frat house.<br /> <br />  My first reaction was, 'We need to go to police,'  he said.  I wanted to go to police immediately. I was really forceful on that, actually. And I almost took it to calling (the police) right there.  He said he had his phone out, prepared to call 9-1-1,  but she didn't want to and,  he remembers thinking,  'I can't do that if she doesn't want to do it.' <br /> <br /> Stock corroborated this version of events.<br /> <br />  Jackie's response was, 'I don't want to,'  Stock said.  'I don't want to do that right now. I just want to go to bed.' <br /> <br /> Feeling hamstrung by Jackie's refusal to go to authorities, Duffin said that days later he sought advice from his dorm's resident assistant. Careful not to mention Jackie by name, so the RA wouldn't be obligated to contact police, he said he asked if he should call police even though Jackie didn't want him to. The RA told Duffin that he should encourage Jackie to talk with police, but that Duffin couldn't force her to do so.<br /> <br /> The RA, who asked not to be named, confirmed Duffin's story to the AP.

"What Have We Become?"	"<em> A good end cannot sanctify evil means; nor must we ever do evil that good may come of it. </em> -- William Penn<br /> <br /> The iconic images of recent protests in Ferguson, Missouri -- after the police shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen -- have left Americans of all ilks wondering: <em>Is this America?</em> Military Humvees, still in camouflage and mounted with machine guns, in the hands of municipal police. SWAT teams of police in full riot gear, bristling with automatic weapons, pointed at a lone protestor with hands up. Have we become a police state?<br /> <br /> Americans now have yet another  What have we become?  question to ponder. In 2012, after a four-year study, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSIC) completed a classified, 6700-page report on the CIA's detention and  enhanced  interrogation techniques of enemy combatants post 9/11. In April of this year, the bipartisan SSIC voted 11-3 to release the report's executive summary. After months of delays to allow time for CIA redactions, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's chair, released the report's 528-page <a href= http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2014/12/politics/torture-report  target= _hplink >summary</a> to the public on December 9.<br /> <br /> Even after redactions, the details -- of renditions to secret detention sites in foreign countries and widespread use of torture during brutal interrogations -- are horrifying. Interrogation techniques included both psychological and physical torture: facial and abdominal slaps, beatings,  walling  (being slammed into a wall), ice-water baths, forced rectal rehydration and/or rectal  feeding,  sleep deprivation for up to 180 hours, shackling for extended periods while in stress positions, isolation, sensory deprivation, loud music, enforced nudity, hooding, mock executions, and for some detainees,  water boarding,  i.e, near-drowning to the point that some detainees turned blue and required resuscitation. In addition, some detainees were told that family members would be murdered or sexually assaulted. Others, given no waste buckets, were placed in diapers. One detainee, Gul Rahman, died from hyperthermia, after having been short-shackled to a wall, nude from the waste down, forcing him to sit on bare concrete for extended periods. <br /> <br /> <center><br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-abu_ghraib.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-abu_ghraib.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-abu_ghraib-thumb.jpg  width= 263  height= 350  /></a><br /> <em>Torture of Ali Shallal al-Qaisi at Abu Ghraib prison, Iraq 2003 (Wikipedia, public domain)</em><br /> </center><br /> <br /> Thirty years ago, the United Nations General Assembly completed its <a href= http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm  target= _hplink >Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT).  The CAT became the world's moral standard on June 26, 1987, following ratification by the 20th nation. By 2014, the CAT had 155 signatories, including the U.S., which ratified the Convention in 1994.<br /> <br /> The CAT defines torture in Article 1 Part I as <em> any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person, information or a confession ... </em> Article 4 makes torture a criminal offense, and Article 8 establishes torture as an extraditable offense. Plain and simple, torturers are war criminals under international convention.<br /> <br /> The U.S. has grossly violated international norms of civilized behavior. We have also broken our word.  Why should American's care?<br /> <br /> William Penn, the Quaker founder of Pennsylvania, once offered sage advice for many situations in the quote at the beginning of this article.  The end <em>never</em> justifies inhuman means. There are many reasons -- legal, moral, practical, and spiritual -- why torture is both reprehensible and indefensible.<br /> <br /> <u>First</u>, torture is illegal, as established by international consensus. Civilized societies do not torture. Period.<br /> <br /> <u>Second</u>, it is immoral.   Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,  states the Golden Rule, which is found in <em>all</em> major religions and specifically as Christianity's second great commandment. The commandment has no asterisks indicating which categories of  others  permit exceptions.<br /> <br /> <u>Third</u>, from purely practical considerations, torture is ineffective. According to Item No. 1 of the summary's conclusions: <em> The CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation of detainees.  </em>Specifically, it did not conclusively produce evidence that led to the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, nor has it been shown to produce information that could not be obtained by other means.  <br /> <br /> <u>Fourth</u>, setting the precedent of torture puts our own soldiers and intelligence officers at risk of torture should they be apprehended for interrogation. <br /> <br /> <u>Fifth</u>, by stooping to torture, the U.S. undermines its own credibility and moral authority in the world. Specifically, Item No. 20 of the conclusions states: <em> The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program damaged the United States' standing in the world, and resulted in other significant monetary and non-monetary costs. </em><br /> <br /> <u>Lastly</u> but foremost, torture not only dehumanizes the one tortured, it also dehumanizes those enacting the torture. Put bluntly, torture degrades us as a species. For a first-hand account of a world in which such inhumanity is a daily norm, read Laura Hillenbrand's blockbuster <em>Unbroken</em>. This meticulously researched biography chronicles the hellacious experiences of Louis Zamperini, an American aviator held for two years in Japanese POW camps during World War II. (The <a href= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebHji2c_ciU  target= _hplink >film version</a> of <em>Unbroken</em> will be released Christmas Day.)<br /> <br /> No one understands what's at stake better than Senator and former presidential candidate John McCain, who was severely tortured by the North Vietnamese during his nearly six years as a Vietnam-War POW, some of it at the infamous  Hanoi Hilton. <br /> <br /> <blockquote>I have often said, and will always maintain, that this question isn't about our enemies; it's about us. It's about who we were, who we are and who we aspire to be. It's about how we represent ourselves to the world.</blockquote><br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/09/politics/mccain-lauds-release-terror-report/index.html  target= _hplink >McCain continues</a>,  Our enemies act without conscience. We must not. <br /> <br /> If Americans continue to permit -- by design, acquiescence, or inattention -- a perpetual state of warfare, the militarization of our police forces, and illegal and immoral uses of torture, we will soon become a nation of individuals who can no longer look into the mirror without averting our gaze.<br /> <br /> Is this the America we want?<br /> <br /> If not, then it is the duty of each of us to contact our legislators, demanding an end to all uses of and excuses for torture, and prosecution for all those who violate the consensus norms of civilized societies and nations.<br /> <br /> Ironically, the only current or former CIA operative in prison regarding torture is John Kiriakou, who blew the whistle on waterboarding.

"Police Arrest Suspect In Shooting Death Of Auburn Player"	"AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — A 22-year-old man has been arrested on a felony warrant charging him with murder in Sunday's fatal shooting of Auburn football player Jakell Lenard Mitchell, police said. The shooting took place at the same off-campus apartment complex where two former football players and a third man were slain in 2012.<br /> <br /> Auburn Police said at least 14 hours after the early morning shooting that Markale Deandra Hart of Camp Hill, Alabama, had been taken into custody. Police Capt. Will Matthews also said in an emailed statement that Hart was being held at a county jail and no additional arrests were anticipated.<br /> <br /> It was not immediately known if Hart had an attorney and the statement didn't provide details of how he was taken into custody.<br /> <br /> Police also disclosed new details that the 18-year-old freshman Mitchell had received multiple gunshot wounds to the chest. No one else was reported shot or hurt, police have said.<br /> <br /> Matthews had said hours earlier that police answered a call about 12:25 a.m. Sunday of shots fired at the Tiger Lodge apartment complex, a few miles from the Auburn campus. He said Mitchell was taken to a hospital in nearby Opelika, Alabama, where he was pronounced dead.<br /> <br /> Auburn University team coach Gus Malzahn said Sunday he was  devastated and saddened  by the death of the promising player, a halfback described by the team website as versatile on offense with blocking, catching and running skills.<br /> <br />  My thoughts and prayers are with Jakell's family and friends, who are suffering through this senseless tragedy. I know the Auburn Family is hurting, especially our players and coaches, and we are going to love and support them through this difficult time,  he said in a statement.  We have lost a member of our family too young, too soon. <br /> <br /> Mitchell redshirted this season for the Auburn Tigers out of nearby Opelika High School. Able to play both back and tight end, he was expected to contend for a starting spot next season, reports indicated. Mitchell missed his senior season at Opelika as he recovered from an ACL injury. He had rushed for 392 yards and 17 touchdowns in 2013 as a high school junior.<br /> <br /> The gated apartment complex was quiet Sunday, with large amounts of broken glass in the parking lot and blue spray paint on the ground where police marked possible evidence. Police looked Sunday morning on as a red car bearing the license plate  Jakell  was towed away.<br /> <br /> Police have released few details of exactly what happened, but residents described hearing gunfire and screams.<br /> <br /> Drake Ledet, an Auburn sophomore living in an apartment near the shooting scene, told AP he heard several gunshots after midnight.<br /> <br />  I'd say it was at least eight (shots),  Ledet said, adding he looked outside to see what was happening.  People were screaming ... I saw people scattering everywhere, getting in their cars. <br /> <br /> Ledet and other residents said there were two parties going on Saturday night at the complex. Students had just completed their final exams on Friday and winter graduation ceremonies were held Saturday.<br /> <br /> Jeremy Johnson, Auburn's backup quarterback, was one of those who drove up before midday Sunday to quietly see the site and remember Mitchell. Johnson said he wasn't present at the time of the shooting, but wanted to come by after learning of his teammate's death.<br /> <br />  I couldn't believe it,  Johnson said, growing emotional.  Jakell was a real good kid. <br /> <br /> Auburn Director of Athletics Jay Jacobs called the shooting a  terrible tragedy  in a statement.<br /> <br />  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Jakell Mitchell's family and those who have been impacted by this terrible tragedy. This is a very trying time for those close to Jakell, including the student-athletes, coaches, staff and Auburn Family. We will provide counseling and support and do everything we can to help them through the grieving process,  he said.<br /> <br /> The apartment complex is the same where authorities say Desmonte Leonard killed three men at a party in the summer of 2012. The complex, a few miles from campus, is popular with students. Its name was changed following the 2012 shooting.<br /> <br /> Jurors convicted Leonard of capital murder in the shooting deaths of former Auburn football players Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips along with DeMario Pitts. Three other people were wounded.<br /> <br /> Leonard's attorney said that 2012 shooting stemmed from a fight and that Leonard fired in self-defense. Prosecutors argued that Leonard aimed at the victims and wasn't involved in the initial fight.<br /> <br /> Leonard will be sentenced on Jan. 20. The jury recommended life without parole, but the judge could still sentence him to death.<br /> <br /> At least one Tiger Lodge resident said Sunday he wanted to move from the complex.<br /> <br />  There have been four people killed here. Once again this place is on the national news,  said junior Barrett Kearens. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 16:48:11 -0500"	"crime"
"Newtown -- Two Years Later"	"Today marks two years since the tragic mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 first graders and six educators. Sadly, Sandy Hook was not the last shooting to impact our schools... far from it.<br /> <br /> According to an updated report by <a href= http://everytown.org/article/schoolshootings/  target= _hplink >Everytown</a> for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action, there have been at least 94 shootings at schools across the country since the Sandy Hook tragedy, resulting in 44 deaths and 78 injuries. That's 94 times a gun has gone off in or around an American school. These incidents include suicides, gang-related gun violence, accidental shootings, and simple arguments that may not have been fatal had a gun not been present.<br /> <br /> When people discuss school shootings, what immediately comes to mind are those like Sandy Hook that shatter entire communities within minutes, even seconds. And yes, mass shootings take a devastating toll, but they are not the only senseless acts of gun violence that threaten our schools.<br /> <br /> Often times, the media dismisses school shootings that resemble so-called  gang violence,  not to mention accidental shootings and suicides at schools.  But the bottom line is that any time a gun goes off at school, children and parents should be terrified.  Should a victim's mother feel any less heartache knowing her child was killed in an accidental shooting or because of gang activity?<br /> <br /> I recently met a Chicago mom -- Pamela Wright -- whose only son, Tyrone, was shot and killed nearly two years ago following a high school basketball game -- one of the 94 school shootings since the Sandy Hook tragedy. Tyrone was doing nothing wrong -- he was simply leaving a basketball game on Friday night, like any other high school kid. Is his death any less meaningful than those who have died in mass shootings? It is irresponsible and dangerous for the media to dismiss Tyrone's death as just another kid in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Anytime a gun is fired on school grounds, fear strikes the parents and members of that community. That could be my son, or yours.<br /> <br /> This week, Moms Demand Action <a href= http://momsdemandaction.org/in-the-news/two-years-since-newtown-everytown-moms-demand-action-release-report-nearly-100-school-shootings-advertisement-lockdown-culture-american-schools/  target= _hplink >released</a> a powerful video that depicts the lockdown culture in American classrooms, and reminds us that these kinds of threats confront kids in schools everywhere, every day.  While our children are facing these fears in their classrooms, our elected officials are hesitant to take action. We owe our children a world where they don't have to practice shielding themselves from a barrage of bullets in their classrooms, and a country where our leaders take the security of our schoolchildren seriously.<br /> <br /> We do not send our children to school to learn how to hide from gunmen, nor should we expect sharpshooting to be a job requirement for educators. The work to change the culture of gun violence in America has begun, but with nearly 100 school shootings since Sandy Hook, it is apparent there is so much more to be done. Until Americans step up and demand policies and laws that will keep guns out of dangerous hands and keep our schools safe, these tragedies, this new normal, will continue. It's time we hold our elected leaders accountable and demand more.  <br /> <br /> I will never forget Sandy Hook, nor will the moms and other supporters who have joined me in this fight. But we also must never forget the 44 young lives that have been ripped from their families and loved ones in the school shootings since. We cannot allow these victims to become merely statistics, and Moms are more determined than ever to make real progress on this issue in their name. Join us.

"Sony Demands News Outlets Stop Publishing Information From Leaked Documents"	"By Lisa Richwine<br /> <br /> LOS ANGELES, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Sony Pictures Entertainment told certain news organizations on Sunday to stop publishing information contained in documents stolen by hackers who attacked the movie studio's computer network last month, three media groups reported.<br /> <br /> The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter and Variety published stories reporting that they had each received a letter from David Boies, an attorney for Sony, demanding that the outlets stop reporting information contained in the documents and immediately destroy them.<br /> <br /> The studio  does not consent to your possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading or making any use  of the information, Boies wrote in the letter, according to the New York Times report.<br /> <br /> A Sony spokesman had no comment on the reports. Representatives for Variety and The Hollywood Reporter could not immediately be reached via email on Sunday.<br /> <br /> New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said:  Any decisions about whether or how to use any of the information will take into account both the significance of the news and the questions of how the information emerged and who has access to it. <br /> <br /> A spokesman for Boies confirmed he sent a letter to certain media outlets on behalf of Sony but declined to discuss details.<br /> <br /> Disclosures from the internal documents have caused turmoil at the studio, a unit of Japan's Sony Corp, and shed light on internal discussions key to the company's future. For instance, the unidentified hackers have released troves of documents that include employee salaries and financial information, marketing plans and contracts with business partners.<br /> <br /> In addition, the documents that have emerged included an exchange in which Co-Chairman Amy Pascal joked about President Barack Obama's race. After media outlets reported that, Pascal subsequently issued a public apology for  insensitive and inappropriate  emails.<br /> <br /> Pascal is scheduled to meet this week with civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, whose spokeswoman says he is weighing whether to call for her resignation. Pascal did not respond to a request for comment, and a Sony spokeswoman declined to comment on Pascal's future.<br /> <br /> Sony, in a memo to staff seen by Reuters on Dec. 2, acknowledged that a large amount of data was stolen by the hackers but has declined to confirm specific documents.<br /> <br /> Over the weekend, a message claiming to be from the Guardians of Peace, a group that says it carried out the cyber attack on Sony, warned of additional disclosures.<br /> <br />  We are preparing for you a Christmas gift,  said the message posted on a site for sharing files called Pastebin.

"5 Ways Dining Out Can Improve Your Management Style"	"With an open mind and a taste for humility, powerful leadership lessons can be found in simple, everyday experiences. Despite almost 20 years of experience helping to facilitate communications for corporate clients and my acknowledgment that I'm a recovering addict of management tomes, recently I've found some of the most clear management lessons are right in front of us. To <a href= http://www.edelman.com/show-up-differently/  target= _hplink >show up differently</a> as builders and leaders of successful teams, we need to open our eyes to success in other fields. For example, can we learn leadership lessons from an average night out on the town?<br /> <br /> Well, when you find yourself dining at a restaurant that's at the top of its game, ask yourself: what makes your overall experience so satisfying? When you start to observe the care that goes into each intangible customer touch point, you'll realize that it's so much more than just how the food tastes. These details are precisely the great restaurant secrets we need to learn from and respect in order to craft our highest-performing client teams. <br /> <br /> Here's my take:<br />   <br /> 1. <strong>Ingredients alone do not a great meal make. </strong>Just like a soufflé, you can have all the right ingredients - but it's likely to flop if you don't get the proportions right. Same goes for teams: you can have all the right people, expertise and capacity, but if you don't get the right proportion of each, the initiative can quickly become a disaster. You may need that expert of some esoteric subject matter, but what if they dominate every discussion? Certain ingredients and individuals can be overpowering, despite how crucial they are in making a meal or program shine. Balance your proportions accordingly!<br /> <br /> 2. <strong>Master the fundamentals.</strong> Sure, a signature dish may be delicious, but if you have to ask for silverware and water refills, or continually flag down your server, you're far more likely to tell your friends about that negative experience rather than the positive parts. Same goes for your teams - they can be  strategic  all day long, but if they can't deliver on the fundamentals, few clients are going to stick around or recommend them to others. Brilliant moments are just that: moments. Team members who consistently deliver are what breed loyalty and trust. <br /> <br /> 3. <strong>Timing is crucial:</strong> A well-paced meal matches the diner's needs at the time. In order to savor the goods, you can't be rushed. Conversely, when you're on your lunch hour, you should never endure painfully slow service. That said, it's important to time your pitches accordingly. If your boss is in the midst of answering an urgent request from the CEO or the board, that isn't the time to wow them with your next big idea and a 40-slide presentation of amazingness. Deliver on their immediate needs first and they'll be far more open to hearing about unearthed opportunities that you and your team can offer later. <br /> <br /> 4. <strong>Play your position. </strong>There are distinct staff positions in great restaurants for a reason. The high performance of the chef, server, sommelier and dishwasher are all important. But, true success only occurs when they work together. No leader should ever be above collaborating and jumping in to support any role if that's what the organization needs most to succeed. In fact, all team members should be aware of their ability to collaborate. While a dishwasher can't always act as a chef, they can alert a problem to the general manager, allowing the manager to jump in. Even if a junior team member can't pick up the workload, they can admit to needing help so that the team can course correct the end result, making it imperative that no one be above their role in order to deliver.<br /> <br /> 5.<strong> Real-time feedback is key.</strong> If your soup is cold, tell your server in the moment so they have a chance to correct it right then - saving yourself from logging onto Yelp to complain when you get home. This also applies to your business: if you didn't get what you needed from a client assignment brief, tell the client in the moment. Or, if you didn't get what you asked from your team, tell your team first and give them a chance to correct it. When leaders and teams both engage in continuous feedback, the result is better work, more engaged teams and lasting relationships. Things will go wrong - it's what you do about them in the moment that matters most. <br /> <br /> If nothing more, consider putting aside the latest management article from a leadership guru du jour and head to your favorite neighborhood café or fine-dining destination. How do they do what they do, and how can you learn from their talent? <br /> <br /> Do you agree with this approach? How might I have gotten it right or wrong? What other unexpected places offer lessons in leadership?<br /> <br /> I looking forward to your observations. Feel free to share your list of must-visit restaurants, too.

"It's 2015. How Are We Still Having These Conversations?"	"In 1985, while my mother was working as an insurance claims specialist, she thoroughly investigated a roof collapse at a large office building. She inspected the roof herself, interviewed witnesses and did significantly more than any of her male colleagues would have done, which she knew because they told her so, repeatedly. Upon discovering that the collapse was the result of a bird nesting problem that she had warned the insured about a year earlier, and which they had done nothing to abate, she denied the claim. This greatly angered the insured and the agent who wrote the policy, inciting them to launch multiple complaints against her, but ultimately, they admitted that she was right. The insurance company kept the agent and the agent kept the insured's business, and all was right in the world.<br /> <br /> Months later, however, the head of the claims department was giving a talk at their big annual meeting and suddenly said to the 2,000 assembled employees there,  And ask Tierney if she plans to take down the whole company with her pigeon poop crusade.  It was not said as a joke. Immediately after this snide comment, the next order of business was to give an award to a claims adjuster who had saved the company $16,000 on a single claim. <br /> <br /> My mom went above and beyond the call of her job, saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars, didn't cost them any business, and for that, was mocked in front of all of her colleagues. One of her male counterparts somehow saved them a fraction of that and was given an award. Nobody involved would have ever seen this as a male-female issue, but it was. The same complaints would not have been lodged or entertained, the nasty comment would not have been made, and the award would have been give to the right person if the roof collapse claim had been denied by someone with a penis. <br /> <br /> But that was 30 years ago. Clearly things are much better for women in the workplace now. Aren't they?<br /> <br /> This week <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD0L0M7rtA  target= _hplink >a video went viral</a> of a group of female business school students owning the word,  bitch.  Anyone paying attention would understand that that is the point they are making. They are reminding women that in today's corporate world, if someone calls you a bitch, it must mean you're doing something right. It must mean that you are standing your ground, staying strong, refusing to back down for yourself or your clients, demanding what you're worth, claiming your rightful place in the hierarchy -- all those things that every book on female leadership tells us we should be doing. All those things that cause us to be called bitches. <br /> <br /> So many critics of this parody refuse to acknowledge the inequalities for women in the workplace, both in perception and reward, instead clinging to insignificant, intended-to-be-funny moments in the video as a means of saying,  Aha! You're never going to succeed if you behave <em>that</em> way.  One of my most evolved and erudite male friends commented:  Ladies in business who are emulating their aggressive male colleagues, you are not bitches. You're assholes, just like they are, and frankly, if the best solution you've got is  be as much of a jerk as they are,  we're not getting anywhere. <br /> <br /> I am stunned that anyone who has ever worked in any workplace cannot see that men succeeding in their jobs are not considered assholes, and yet, when women behave in the exact same way, they are often viewed as bitches. Tough negotiating, asking for more money, refusing to do someone else's job for them, refusing to be the one who gets coffee or takes notes when you're the only women in the room and some man has just asked you to (which happened to me more than once, both as a securities lawyer and an investment banker) all make someone see us as bitches, or difficult, or assholes, when that same behavior gets men respect (not that a man would ever have to refuse to get coffee because he wouldn't be asked in the first place).<br /> <br /> We cannot dismiss the issues facing women in the workplace simply because one smart, funny group of students included a bondage shot in their parody video. Women excel in law and business school, and have been 50 percent of the graduating classes for about two decades now, but still only have 10 percent representation in the upper echelons in those industries. Female-owned start-ups get a fraction of the investment that male-owned start-ups do (per capita, not just in total). <a href= http://www.fastcompany.com/3034895/strong-female-lead/the-one-word-men-never-see-in-their-performance-reviews  target= _hplink >In a study of performance reviews</a>, linguist Kieran Snyder discovered that the word  abrasive  appeared in 17 out of 94 reviews of female executives, but not a single time in men's reviews. Are we to conclude that women are just naturally more abrasive than men, or is it that women doing the same job in the same way as their male counterparts are viewed more negatively? I think we all know it's the latter, but if some want to continue to deny it, there's nothing the rest of us can do except glance back at them clinging to their rationalizations and self-delusion as we move forward towards workplace equality.<br /> <br /> It's almost 2015 -- 30 years since my mother was publicly ridiculed for being good at her job. How are we still having these conversations? The person kicking ass in that negotiation might have ovaries, but that doesn't require her to smile sweetly and make sure everyone is okay with the outcome of this deal. She has an agenda, just like everyone else, and if her agenda wins, that does not make her a bitch, it makes her a success. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that these students are telling women to embrace the word,  bitch,  but don't for one second think that women are only called bitches in the boardroom when they behave like assholes. They're called that when they behave like leaders, and if this video reminds us all that it's time to get over that word, and hold our ground, and own it, then these young women have truly succeeded and I applaud them.<br /> <br /> <em>Valerie Alexander is the author of <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OB3S0OU?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00OB3S0OU&linkCode=xm2&tag=speakhappi-20  target= _hplink >How Women Can Succeed in the Workplace (Despite Having  Female Brains )</a>, which takes a frank and honest approach to examining how women can compete on a playing field designed by men to reward their achievements.

"Update: Verizon's CFO Sticks His Foot in His Mouth Over Title II and Investment -- Where's the Investigations?"	"<strong>Missing Fact:</strong><a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/verizon-uses-title-ii-as_b_6266860.html  target= _hplink >  Verizon Uses 'Title II' as a Cash Machine Today</a> -- It Harms Customers, Not Investments , December 4th, 2014.<br /> <br /> <strong>FACT:</strong> From a Verizon New York cable franchise, 2014.<br /> <br />  <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-FiostitleII.png ><img alt= 2014-12-14-FiostitleII.png  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-FiostitleII-thumb.png  width= 570  height= 84  /></a><br /> <br /> On December 9th, 2014, Verizon's CFO Francis Shammo was speaking at the <a href= ents-at-ubs-42nd-annual-global-media-and-communications-conference-transcript%3fpart=single  target= _hplink >UBS 42nd Annual Global Media & Communications Conference</a> for investors and made a comment -- even if the networks were to be reclassified as  Title II  in the Net Neutrality proceedings, it would not harm or influence investment. <br /> <br /> <strong>John Hodulik</strong>, Communications Analyst, UBS<br /> <blockquote><br />  Obviously there's a lot of commentary coming out of Washington about this move to Title II. Obviously Verizon has been one of the more of a stiffer opponents of any sort of increased regulation, especially on the Wireless side. What's your view of that potential occurrence down in Washington and does it affect your view on the attractiveness of investing further in the United States? </blockquote><br /> <br /> <strong>Francis J. Shammo</strong>, EVP and CFO<br /> <br /> <blockquote> I mean to be real clear, I mean this does not influence the way we invest. I mean we're going to continue to invest in our networks and our platforms, both in Wireless and Wireline FiOS and where we need to. So nothing will influence that. I mean if you think about it, look, I mean we were born out of a highly regulated company, so we know how this operates. But related to this discussion around Net Neutrality, the FCC has the right to regulate under 765, they do not need to go to Title II, and why would you go to a 1930 piece of literature to try to regulate something that is a 21st-century technology.<br /> <br />  And I also think that if you look at other countries who have done this, it kind of leads you down to path of total failure because it really, really slows down investment and slows down innovation. So I guess the last comment is, it's working, why do we need regulations around something that's working. And again, they can do this under the realms of their legal ability. And I think if they go all the way to the extreme of Title II, I'll quote what Randal said on stage about a month ago, which is, I think it's going to be a very litigious environment. </blockquote><br /> <br /> Stories by Re/code, The New York Times and the Washington Post, among others, came out. <a href= http://recode.net/2014/12/11/verizon-what-we-meant-when-we-said-net-neutrality-rules-wouldnt-influence-our-investment-strategy/  target= _hplink >Re/code </a>writes:<br /> <br /> <blockquote> Verizon Communications CFO Fran Shammo clearly didn't read the industry memo about how more regulation of broadband lines is bad because it would lead Internet providers to stop investing in their networks. </blockquote><br /> <br /> And Re/code points out that Verizon has been telling anyone who will listen that Title II is bad for investment.<br /> <br /> <blockquote> The problem here is that Verizon and other Internet providers have repeatedly warned that future investments in broadband networks may not happen if the FCC opts to re-regulate Internet lines under Title II. Shammo's remarks appear to contradict what his own company has been telling Washington, which is that tougher net neutrality rules would stifle investment. </blockquote><br /> <br /> The article also claims that telling one story to investors and another to the Washington lawmakers is common. <br /> <br /> <blockquote> To be fair, there is a long tradition of highly regulated companies telling Wall Street one thing and Washington another. </blockquote><br /> <br /> And the <a href= http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/verizon-says-investment-will-be-unaffected-by-net-neutrality-policy/?comments#permid=13569031  target= _hplink >New York Times</a>  adds that there are many others who are chanting the 'Title II harms investment' mantra, including equipment manufacturers, who wrote a letter condemning the possible return to Title II.<br /> <br /> <blockquote> Opponents have said that such a move will stifle investment by companies. This week, a group of large telecommunications equipment companies, including Cisco Systems, IBM and Intel, wrote to the F.C.C. urging it not to adopt Title II classification. <br /> <br />  Title II would lead to a slowdown, if not a hold, in broadband build-out, because if you don't know that you can recover on your investment, you won't make it,  the group wrote in its letter.  The investment shortfall would then flow downstream, landing first and squarely on technology companies like ours, and then working its way through the economy over all.... </blockquote><br /> <br /> Verizon had to do some damage control. Verizon's blog had a <a href= http://publicpolicy.verizon.com/blog/entry/the-relationship-between-investment-and-regulation  target= _hplink >guest post</a> from Fran Shammo: <br /> <br /> <blockquote> Last night, (December 10th, 2014) a few news sites ran stories about recent comments I made at an investor conference in response to a question about how the threat of Title II regulation might impact Verizon's capital investment.<br /> <br />  As Verizon has indicated on several occasions over the past few weeks, discussions about potential regulatory changes related to net neutrality have been going on for a decade, and we don't change our short-term view on investment based on rumors of what might or might not happen. But as we and other observers of the net neutrality debate have made abundantly clear, experience in other countries shows that over-regulation decreases network investment. If the U.S. ends up with permanent regulations inflicting Title II's 1930s-era rules on broadband Internet access, the same thing will happen in the U.S. and investment in broadband networks will go down. </blockquote><br /> <br /> The <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/12/10/verizon-actually-strong-net-neutrality-rules-wont-affect-our-network-investment/  target= _hplink >Washington Post</a> detailed that Verizon still plans to sue the FCC over any decision that reclassifies broadband as Title II: <br /> <br /> <blockquote> Shammo and Verizon are still strongly against Title II, and the industry will likely sue the FCC if it resorts to reclassification. But Shammo acknowledged that, Title II or not, Verizon would keep pouring the same money into its network as it has been.<br /> <br />  In a statement, Verizon spokesman Rich Young said this has been the company's message all along: 'Verizon has been very consistent with what we've been saying in this area. In this case our CFO's message is again clear. At this stage, no change'. </blockquote><br /> <br /> Huh. <br /> <br /> <ul><li><strong>FACT: </strong>Verizon's entire Fiber-to-the-Premises (FTTP) networks used by FiOS TV are already classified as a Title II, common carriage, telecommunications network, based on the Communications Act of 1934. </li><br /> <li><strong>FACT: </strong>Verizon uses Title II so that it can get the state telecommunications utility network's rights-of-way and charge phone customers for construction. </li><br /> <li><strong>FACT:</strong> Verizon has deceived the FCC, the courts and the public (and some of the media) about these facts. </li><br /> <li><strong>FACT: </strong><a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/you-have-been-charged-tho_b_6306360.html  target= _hplink >Customers have been charged thousands for a fiber-optic, broadband utility that you never got -- over the last 20-plus years.</a></li><br /> <li><strong>FACT:</strong> We solved Net Neutrality. It's already Title II. It's already  reclassified . </li></ul><br /> <br /> Now it's time to investigate. <br /> <br /> For what all this means see: <a href= http://newnetworks.com/bookofbrokenpromises.htm  target= _hplink ><em>  The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal and Free the Net. </em><br /> </a> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 17:17:08 -0500"	"business"
"Dysfunction in the Nonprofit Sector -- Reality or Myth?"	"Judging from the vast literature on dysfunctional nonprofit boards and organizations (my own posts included!) one might conclude that the majority of nonprofits are struggling, strategically incompetent and/or in crisis. I argue that this is not the case. Decades of experience lead me to believe that nonprofits have the same functional variables as profit making organizations--dysfunctional at times like Target or GM; efficient like Apple or Whole Foods; adaptable like Del Monte and Cisco. Everybody doesn't get it right all the time.<br /> <br /> Perceptions become reality to those who are quick to embrace popular labels such as the overused term,  dysfunctional.  Obviously, in the case of nonprofits, such perceptions are harmful. Once evaluated in this way the stigma persists and can seriously reduce the level of support that is so critical to the work of these organizations.<br /> <br />    <strong> What characteristics color these perceptions?</strong><br /> <br /> • <strong>Small Organizations</strong>: About one-third of the charitable nonprofits have gross receipts under $25,000 a year. At that level the vast majority can't employ more than one full-time person, overworking those with job responsibilities that can't be delegated. While small organization can't do much to improve the misperceptions about nonprofit dysfunctions, more mature ones can take deliberate steps over time.<br /> <br /> • <strong>The Volunteer Challenge:</strong> A large cadre of board and operational volunteers take time to assist struggling charities, which give the organizations appearances of nonprofit always being on the edge or existence. Many outsiders are unaware that those on management and staff are highly competent people who accept this employment condition because they know how their work can positively impact the lives of clients.<br /> <br /> • <strong>Facilities</strong>: Nonprofit facilities are often second rate and appear highly dysfunctional. Client needs, not facilities, are primary to the board, management and staff.<br /> <br /> •<strong> Board Relationships:</strong> Many relationships between the board and management can be similar to that of a  parent-child  one. In the words of one nonprofit director,  We tell the executive director exactly what to do. <br /> <br /> • <strong>Stakeholders</strong>: They often do not appreciate the tremendous impacts that the staff can have. Example: Donors often don't have contact with those who directly benefit.<br /> <br /> • <strong>Board Dysfunctions</strong>: A root cause of the perception may be due to a dysfunctional board trying to resolve internal conflicts, and there is little the management and staff can do about it. Valiant managements and staffs can sometimes achieve productive impacts without board support.<br /> <br />     <strong>What can be done?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Competency & Relationships:</strong> I have encountered many CEOs who have more management expertise than many of their board members who are professors, accountants or physician, etc. While I appreciated that dealing with volunteer directors may involve working with some persons with outsized egos, the CEO must strive to portray himself as a competent manager. The positive outcome is that the CEO is viewed as a peer working with the board, not under the board.<br /> <br /> Many staff persons figuratively stand ten feet tall for what they accomplish on behalf of clients.. The CEO has an obligation to make sure that the stories about outstanding staff personnel are well acknowledged, so that stakeholders know about them. This takes more then simple public relations events. It involves highlighting and rewarding those who are highly productive.<br /> <br /> <strong>Facilities</strong>: I understand the tradeoff between expenditures for facilities versus expenditures for clients. Having first class facilities may even hinder achieving a mission if donors perceive their donations are being used for plush facilities. At the least, the nonprofit needs to have an uncluttered area for board meetings and events with outside stakeholders.<br /> <br /> <strong>Implications</strong>: Many suggest that a nonprofit organization being perceived as dysfunctional is not an important issue, as long as mission objectives and impacts are achieved. I argue that more resources for clients could be developed if the perception is not a diminished one. Some can equate dysfunction with being inefficient. In addition, a positive perception might make it easier to attract more qualified board members, management and staff. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 14:25:09 -0500"	"business"
"Fun With Telemarketers"	"After spending five minutes of my life that I'll never get back again trying to politely get rid of a slick-talking dude who'd phoned, intent upon selling me seasons tickets to the opera, I asked my Facebook pals  What's the best way to deal with telemarketers?  <br /> <br /> I got a wide range of responses. <br /> <br /> Many had ideas for dispatching them swiftly:   <br />  <em><br />  Hand a 3-year old the phone and tell them it's Santa<br /> <br />  Just tell them you don't speak English. In English.<br /> <br />  I like to belt out a show tune.  If I Were A Rich Man  is nicely ironic.   <br />  <br />  Modulate your voice and pretend you're an answering machine. <br /> <br />  This is why the Tuba is the best instrument EVER.</em><br />  <em><br />  Start trying to sell them your car. <br /> <br />  Try heavy breathing. <br /> <br />  Say that you're broke, unemployed and being evicted. <br /> <br />  Ask  Where should I send the invoice for this call? I'm a consultant and I bill for my time.  <br /> <br />  I ask them to describe what they're wearing. That usually shuts them down, although I'm not sure why.    <br /> <br />  I always say,  He's here, and I know he'll be very interested in your offer. Hold on a minute while I get him.  Then I put the phone in a drawer.<br /> <br />  Nuke 'em from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.  </em><br /> <br /> Some folks take the opportunity to have a little fun:  <br /> <em><br />  One of our family hobbies is telling whoppers to telemarketers. My son once told a telemarketer that his mother was having a baby and the house was flooded. He said he was talking to her from the roof, and that he needed to get off the phone to call 911.<br /> <br />  I tell them a sob story, then ask them to make a donation to ME. <br /> <br />   Wonderful!,  I tell them.  You've called just in time for our Family Reading Time. Then I read them  Goodnight Moon.  If they stay till the end, I finish with   Goodnight pesky telemarketer.  Click! <br /> <br />  I put my toddler on the phone. She loves to chat and is obsessed with the phone.  Hi! Hi! Hi! What's your name? Hi! Hi! Hi! Did you see Frozen?   <br /> <br />  Say   Congratulations! You're caller number seven and you've won a free trip to the Bahamas. Just give me your full name, address, phone number and credit card information and I'll make all of the necessary arrangements for my vacation... Sorry, I meant YOUR vacation.  <br /> <br />  My mother tells them that they're wasting their time because they've reached an assisted living facility where the average age is 93. Which isn't true, although she herself is 93. Who knows? Perhaps fibbing to telemarketers is helping to keep her brain nimble.    </em><br /> <em><br />  An anthropologist friend turns the tables on them by conducting an ethnographic interview.   That's an interesting accent,  she'll ask.  Where are you from? And how old are you?  She does whatever she can to draw them out and learn as much as she can about their worldview. Her personal best? She kept one guy on the phone for 45 minutes. <br />  <br />  Whenever someone from the Philadelphia Inquirer phones to try to sell me a subscription, I respond with:  My attorney has advised me not to speak to the press. And she's also told me I can beat this rap!  That usually breaks them up.   <br /> <br />  I like to say, in a hushed voice  What's the best way to bury a body in a crawl space?  <br /> </em><br /> Occasionally more than one person gets into the call-deflecting act: <br /> <br /> <em> When telemarketers call my workplace, we put them on hold, then transfer them around the office until they give up. <br /> <br />  One company wouldn't stop calling my cell over and over and over, until my husband took the call and began talking to them in fake German gibberish. I remember one phrase was  up-n-chuck-in and flinger-grabbin.  I never heard from them again.  </em><br /> <br /> Some folks make the encounter short and sweet:  <br /> <br />  <em>Just say no.<br /> <br />  Repeat these magic words:  Take me off your call list.   <br /> <br />  Turn off the phone. No explanation necessary.<br /> <br />  Say  No thanks.  Then hang up and block their number.<br /> </em><br /> Another Surprisingly Popular Response? Being Nice. <br /> <em><br />  How to respond? Reach down and get to your tolerant side and exercise it.<br /> <br />   Thanks for the call, but I'm all set. Have a nice day.   <br /> <br />  If you don't want what they're selling, make it short. Don't waste their time or yours. Someone else might earn them a commission.   <br /> <br />  I once had to sell office supplies over the phone so I try to remember what a soul-sucking job it can be, the way the boss listens in on your calls and the pressure to make a sale. I just say  No thanks  and feel grateful that I never have to do that job again. <br /> <br />  As somebody who did a lot of phone banking when I worked for a state senatorial campaign, I can tell you that these people have the shittiest jobs in the world. The best thing you can do? Just be polite to them.  </em><br /> <br /> All joking aside, here's a response that really got to me: <br /> <em><br />  I was a telemarketer. I am also a human being who was just trying to pay my rent. The best way to be a mensch is to say hello and wish them the best of luck. We telemarketers hate what we do too. Please don't humiliate us.  I witnessed so many emotional breakdowns through the years by people </em>who were just trying to put food in their children's mouths. Enough said.    <br /> <br /> So what do I plan to do going forward? While it's tempting to come up with a sassy putdown or pull out all the stops with a big fat lie, I am, by nature, a  nice, well-mannered person. So here's my script for future encounters: <br /> <br />  Thanks for the call, but I'm not interested. Have a nice day. And please take me off the call list. <br /> <br /> But if they won't take no for an answer, I'm picking up my tuba. <br /> <br /> (First published on <a href= http://www.zestnow.com  target= _hplink >www.zestnow.com</a>) "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 09:56:10 -0500"	"business"
"An 8-Point Guide to Discussions With People Who Support the CIA's Torture Program"	"The Senate Intelligence Committee's recent release of their report on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program (aka<a href= https://www.aclu.org/national-security/senate-torture-report-and-cia-reply-foia  target= _hplink > the CIA Torture Report</a>) has caused quite a public and political stir. And while most reasonable people would agree that torture is categorically immoral, I have been repeatedly amazed (and disheartened) by the vehement support that still rushes to the defense of such a program. <br /> <br /> I have decided to write this piece as a means of confronting various detracting arguments and show their empirical, logical or moral cruxes. I realize that in order to have the most constructive national conversation on this massively important issue, we must take these voices into consideration, even if it is only to better deconstruct and reject them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>1.  The Program Helped Save American Lives/Fight Terror.</strong><br /> <br /> According to the Senate report, this assertion is greatly overstated, at best, and patently false, at worst. Still, there is substantial support for this claim in various political camps and within the CIA community. The extent to which it is true or not will never likely be settled but ultimately, it probably resides somewhere in the middle, although most evidence we have indicates that <a href= http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/torture-it-didnt-work-then-it-doesnt-work-now-9923288.html  target= _hplink >torture is most often quite ineffective</a>.

Number of terror plots allegedly averted aside (<a href= http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/09/politics/cia-torture-report/  target= _hplink >which is quite few if we take the Senate report at its word</a>), as a country of conscious and one that prides itself on moral values, we should never have allowed ourselves to be scared into violating such fundamental principles. Instead of walking ourselves down a Kantian or utilitarian morass of efficacy versus ethical responsibility, we can just stop this discussion at the gate by saying that, regardless of the results, <a href= http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/12/John-Mccain-Speech-Senate-Republican-CIA-Torture-Report/383589/  target= _hplink >torture is wrong</a>. Period. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>2.  The Techniques Used Do Not Legally Constitute Torture.</strong><br /> <br /> The Bush administration was sure to create an extensive legal framework so that at least the semblance of legality (and freedom from indictment, no doubt) accompanied the torture program as it viciously visited itself upon the bodies and minds of detainees. [Note: the use of the word  detainee  versus  prisoner  is one of such legal consideration.  <a href= http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Prisoners+and+Detainees  target= _hplink >Detainees</a>  are individuals who are being held but have not been convicted of a crime.  <a href= https://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/protected-persons/prisoners-war/overview-detainees-protected-persons.htm  target= _hplink >Prisoners</a> , as in prisoners of war, are protected by the Geneva Convention]. This legal framework, however, was contrived and failed to follow international law -- a reality attested to by the number of independent investigations into different aspects of the program by <a href= http://ccrjustice.org/spain-us-torture-case  target= _hplink >Spain</a>, <a href= http://www.ccrjustice.org/case-against-rumsfeld  target= _hplink >France</a>, the <a href= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4996798.stm  target= _hplink >UN</a>, and our own Department of Justice. So the simple technicality that, in fact, a legal umbrella existed in no way changes the nature of the abuses that occurred. <br /> <br /> This is especially relevant when we look at the fact that in many cases, according to the CIA's own information contained within Senate report, <a href= http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/12/cia-senate-torture-report-untrained-agents-made-up-torture-methods  target= _hplink >CIA agents repeatedly exceeded the  acceptable limits </a> of the prescribed enhanced interrogation techniques (EIT). So even this facade of  legality  was ultimately violated, but without recourse.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>3.  Other Countries (Russia, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, etc.) Are Much Worse.</strong><br /> <br /> Personally, this argument is the most frustrating of all. We continually remind ourselves of our exalted status on the world stage, both as a political actor and a moral authority. It is in these moments of tragic moral failure, however, <a href= http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/10/world/senate-report-lister/index.html?hpt=hp_c3  target= _hplink >that we resort to measuring ourselves against the bar set by countries that make no claim to the ethical high-ground</a>. I would agree that, in regards to human rights violations, countries such as Russia, Iran, North Korea and Saudi Arabia are far behind. And yet, when we make a point of condemning their abuses and ignoring our own, the resultant hypocrisy only cedes moral ground in any international efforts to bring them back within the realm of acceptable governance. If, as they say, we are to be measured by the company we keep, this argument does much more to spoil our moral standing than to justify our actions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>4.  The CIA Employees Who Were Involved in This Program Were Patriots, Not Criminals. </strong><br /> <br /> Speaking to this point is tricky. Calling for those  patriots  to be held accountable is wholly taboo. It is hard to make headway against such popular norms without being labeled anti-American, but so it is. While I do not doubt the sincerity of the love that the CIA employees and directors have for their country, I submit that this does not at all exonerate them from responsibility and accountability for their actions.<br /> <br /> This is a textbook example of the crimes that were prosecuted through the <a href= http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/7_1_1950.pdf  target= _hplink >Nuremberg trials</a> against former Nazis. [Disclaimer: I am not comparing complicit members of the CIA to Nazis, just using the analogy to the legal precedent set by the trials that preceded WWII]. These trials made it abundantly clear that  following orders  does not absolve one of responsibility. Patriots they may be, but according to the International Criminal Court (ICC), they are perpetrators of <a href= http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/about%20the%20court/frequently%20asked%20questions/Pages/12.aspx  target= _hplink >crimes against humanity</a> as well -- the two are not mutually exclusive. They are responsible and should be <a href= http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/12/calls-prosecution-after-torture-report-2014121052353558637.html  target= _hplink >held accountable both domestically and internationally</a>. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>5.  The Senate Report on This CIA Program Is Just a Political Ploy.</strong><br /> <br /> The notion that the release of this report was made to coincide with the transition of power in the Senate or any <a href= http://www.mediaite.com/online/conservatives-think-dems-are-releasing-torture-report-to-distract-from-gruber-testimony/  target= _hplink >other politically-charged events</a> is simply juvenile. No matter when this report would have been released, the same challenge would have been raised by the report's detractors. The reality is, there was never a convenient time for us to re-infuse the national conversation with discussion of torture -- that it needed to happen sometime is without doubt.<br /> <br /> Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), addresses the asserted partisanship of the report in his recent <a href= http://news.yahoo.com/ron-wydens-point-point-smackdown-183003336.html  target= _hplink >point-by-point rebuttal to an op-ed written by several former CIA directors</a> who defend the EIT program. He reminds us that,  The Committee initiated this review [the torture report] on a bipartisan 14-1 vote. The Committee's report was approved on a bipartisan 9-6 vote, and the Committee voted to release it on a bipartisan 11-3 vote. <br /> <br /> Additionally, and perhaps even more tellingly, the most damning evidence against the efficacy and ethics of the CIA's program comes from the CIA itself. The extensive internal communications of the CIA paint an explicitly grim and Orwellian picture of what amounts to a state-sanctioned torture program. A common rebuttal to this revelation is that the Senate Intelligence Committee never actually interviewed any of the CIA employees or directors involved in the program, despite the fact that many of them were on the record by means of internal documentation. The absence of their testimony, however, is not an issue of political gamesmanship, but of legality -- many of the program participants were unable or unwilling to go on the record due to <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/obama-justice-department-immunity-bush-cia-torturer  target= _hplink >prior or ongoing criminal investigations</a>. The fact that these individuals were not interviewed is not evidence of a failure by the Senate committee but evidence of the truly comprehensive moral issues with this program.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>6.  We've Already Had This Conversation, No Need to Rehash Old Wounds.</strong><br /> <br /> This issue is not behind us. It is on the tips of the tongues of the international community, especially as we are faced, yet again, with the existential threat of radical fundamentalism in the new and gruesome form of ISIS. In other words, the War on Terror and its subsequent ethical pitfalls are far from over. Additionally, Guantanamo Bay remains alive and well, despite President Obama's campaign promises. It continues to house <a href= http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees  target= _hplink >over a hundred detainees</a>, many of whom have long since been <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/04/25/kafka-at-gitmo-why-86-prisoners-are-cleared-for-release-but-might-never-get-it/  target= _hplink >approved for release and cleared of all charges</a>, existing in a juridical limbo in which no other countries are willing to accept them. In other words, the EIT program might have ended in 2009, but our country is still committing crimes against humanity at this very moment.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>7.  At Least We Are Willing to Confront This Issue.</strong><br /> <br /> I am, admittedly, so thankful that we live in a country with the capacity and freedom to confront such issues in a public and political way. But as our political system is slowly hijacked by corporations, special-interest lobbyists, and the bottomless pockets of an <a href= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=6677116&fileId=S1537592709991770  target= _hplink >increasingly edified elite</a>, I worry that our ability to democratically affect the moral direction of our nation is simultaneously compromised. <br /> <br /> This is a battle being fought and lost in the Supreme Court and on the streets every day, and it is preventing us from bringing necessary change to a vast array of important issues. Is it laudable that this debate is happening? Yes -- although most of these issues seemed rather settled after the 1949 Geneva Convention established prohibitions against torture in any circumstance. Does this debate mean that we will not commit the same egregious moral errors in the future? I worry that this depends more upon what is politically and financially expedient (endless war is incredibly profitable for some) than what we as a nation determine is ethically just. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>8.  <a href= http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/12/fox-host-forget-torture-america-is-awesome.html  target= _hplink >America is AWESOME</a>! Stop trying to make us not awesome :(</strong><br /> <br /> Such emotionally-charged and doubtlessly-genuine epithets are symptomatic of the moral problems we face as a country, not legitimate excuses for them. By creating an atmosphere in which any dissent is automatically dismissed as un-patriotic, anti-American, or otherwise, we simply reinforce the normative attitudes that undermine the power of plurality and diversity in our democratic process. The fervent belief in our own unconditional  awesomeness  is an expression of a dangerous ideology that feeds into notions of our own exceptionalism and unquestionable self-righteousness. Despite what FOX News might have us believe, such blind faith does not  represent greater dedication, but instead the easy way out and the surest path to betray our rights and responsibilities as free citizens. It takes far greater virtue and courage, as a country and as individuals, to critically face our own shortcomings for what they are than to construct a self-reinforcing insulation from them.<br /> <br /> The days after 9/11 were terrifying and confusing indeed.  But it is not in moments of strength, but in those moments of vulnerability that our true resolve and values as a nation stand out. In the sense that such vulnerability led us to defy both international law and our own stated principles, we failed, and in no short order -- so let's try to stop downplaying this whole affair or attempting to justify it along legal or ideological lines. We did not just torture enemy combatants, we <a href= http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/11/opinion/guantanamo-inmate-naji/index.html?iref=allsearch  target= _hplink >tortured fellow human beings</a>, many of whom <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/us/politics/amid-details-on-torture-data-on-26-held-in-error-.html  target= _hplink >later proved innocent</a>. That kind of a stain is hard to remove and rightly so. The longer we try to defend it, the longer it will take us to create meaningful change and move on as a country.

His <a href= http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_prosecutorial_discretion.pdf  target= _hplink >November 20, 2014 memo</a> to ICE, CBP and USCIS specifies three tiered priorities for the  Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants.   At the top, Priority 1 (threats to national security, border security, and public safety) includes:<br /> <br /> - aliens engaged in or suspected of terrorism or espionage, or who otherwise pose a danger to national security;<br /> <br /> - aliens convicted of an offense for which an element was active participation in a criminal street gang;<br /> <br /> - aliens convicted of an offense classified as a felony or an aggravated felony;<br /> <br /> and...wait for it...<br /> <br /> - aliens apprehended at the border or ports of entry while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States.<br /> <br /> So, let me get this straight.  Our top priority for immigration arrests lumps together terrorists, convicted felons, gang bangers and...drywallers, moms and kids?<br /> <br /> To be fair, there is an out for the drywallers, moms and kids:  The removal of these aliens must be prioritized unless they qualify for asylum or another form of relief under our laws, or unless, in the judgment of an ICE Field Office Director, CBP Sector Chief or CBP Director of Field Operations, there are compelling and exceptional factors that clearly indicate the alien is not a threat to national security, border security, or public safety and should not therefore be an enforcement priority. <br /> <br /> But seriously, what should the Border Patrol, or, for that matter, what should any of us, make of Priority 1?  I think the inclusion of drywallers, moms and kids in Priority 1 is a sop to the '<a href= http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/fallacy-enforcement-first  target= _hplink >border enforcement first</a>' crowd, as reflected in the organization of the DHS web page announcing Executive Action, giving Border Security <a href= http://www.dhs.gov/immigration-action  target= _hplink >top billing</a>.<br /> <br /> But, in the end...<br /> <br />  One of these things is not like the others,<br /> One of these things just doesn't belong,<br /> Can you tell which thing is not like the others<br /> By the time I finish my song?<br /> <br /> Did you guess which thing was not like the others?<br /> Did you guess which thing just doesn't belong?<br /> If you guessed this one is not like the others,<br /> Then you're absolutely...right!

"Why Are We Debating the Benefits of Torture?"	"What if <em>Bernie Madoff </em>argued:  Sure I broke the law, but I and a lot of other people benefitted by it!  I am astonished by the amount of time spent and pages included in the recent Senate report on torture devoted to discrediting the <em>CIA</em> claims that their techniques identified terrorists, prevented attacks and saved lives, and that the directors of those practices continue to defend them on that basis. Since when do we test our moral principles, our laws, our Constitution and our international treaties by determining whether or not there is some benefit in violating them? <br /> <br /> <br /> O.K. I recognize the<em> Bernie Madoff </em>analogy is not particularly apt, but for the government to engage in some kind of cost/benefit analysis to justify torture is ludicrous and embarrassing. Think of the precedent it would establish if benefits served to justify violations of the law. Illegal searches in violation of the <em>Fourth Amendment</em> could be justified by gaining evidence of crimes and prosecuting and convicting those who are guilty. Listening in on the content of all conversations could aid in learning of past and future acts of terrorism. The list is endless. We give up something by restricting the government in its fight against terrorism, but that is the price of freedom.<br /> <br /> <br /> The basic furor is over whether or not torture ( enhanced interrogation ) led to locating and killing <em>Osama bin Laden</em>. The answer should be: So what. Yes, there was great benefit and satisfaction in the demise of bin Laden, but it is totally irrelevant in the moral and legal debate over the use of torture. Many Americans, if asked, would probably say that torture would have been justified if it prevented the destruction of the Twin Towers and the deaths that followed. But in getting there we may have tortured persons who were totally innocent, without knowledge or furnished false information.  That is the reality of a torture program. Furthermore, we have signed on to the U.N. Convention Against Torture. It is illegal no matter what the benefit. Calling it by any other name does not change its true character. If we engage in it, we have become no different than our enemies. They see some benefit in threatening and carrying out beheadings. Is that going to be next for us because we envision some benefit to us in doing so? "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 23:18:47 -0500"	"politics"
"What's Left for America's Torture Apologists?"	"For the past several years, America's torture apologists have been telling stories about the CIA's  enhanced interrogation  program. The stories go like this: Following the capture of high-value al Qaeda members, particularly Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the CIA found traditional interrogation techniques inadequate. Facing both the threat of imminent attacks and recalcitrant detainees known to have information about those attacks, the CIA turned to  enhanced interrogation.  Agency interrogators prevented detainees from sleeping by keeping detainees in stress positions, swung detainees into walls, and, in only three cases, waterboarded detainees.  These and other  enhanced  practices underwent rigorous legal review. They were employed with care by trained professionals, who immediately stopped using the techniques when detainees divulged the information that the Agency needed.<br />  <br /> Former-President George W. Bush told this story in September 2006, when he publicly acknowledged the CIA's program. In Congress, some Republicans repeated versions of it. Lamar Smith, a Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, claimed during a December 2007 hearing that  Zubaydah refused to offer any actual intelligence until he was waterboarded for between 30 and 35 seconds  and Mohammed  stayed quiet for months until he was waterboarded for just 90 seconds.  A colleague on the Committee, Trent Franks, made similar claims during a June 2008 hearing:  The CIA waterboarded 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaidah, and Abdul Rahim Nashiri for approximately 1 minute each. The result [sic] ... were of immeasurable benefits to the American people. <br />  <br /> The release of the executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA interrogation program reveals how misleading these stories were. Abu Zubaydah's first waterboarding session took place over a  two-and-a-half hour period,  during which he,  coughed, vomited, and had 'involuntary spasms of the torso and extremities.'  During a later session, Zubaydah  became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth. ... [He] remained unresponsive until medical intervention, when he regained consciousness and expelled 'copious amounts of liquid.' <br />  <br /> Abu Zubaydah was the first detainee that the agency waterboarded. Perhaps, then, these difficulties occurred before the Agency perfected its interrogation program, as John Brennan, the Agency's current director, has implied of most of the problems that the Senate Intelligence report documented. We would expect, then, that CIA interrogators would have perfected waterboaring by the time that they interrogated Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the third detainee who we know suffered the practice. Instead, Mohammed's waterboarding devolved, according to a medic who oversaw it, into  a series of near drownings.  <br />  <br /> No matter a technique's alleged effectiveness, most Americans are reluctant to defend practices that conjure the dark images associated with torture. This explains, in part, the nearly universal condemnation of Abu Ghraib. The photographs were simply too much for most of us, and the tortures that occurred at Abu Ghraib were, rightly, disowned by virtually everyone, conservatives and liberals alike. For advocates of  enhanced interrogation,  Abu Ghraib was especially useful. Disowning it, they could demonstrate that they, too, believe that there are lines that may not be crossed.  Enhanced interrogation  just happens to fall on one side, Abu Ghraib on the other. But now CIA interrogation is looking more and more like Abu Ghraib:  unprofessional, unrestrained, dripping with cruelty, if not sadism.<br />  <br /> So what's left for the country's torture apologists? Continue to claim that the program saved lives and discredit the report for relying too much on the CIA's own emails and cables, rather than interviews. Others will offer a bit of what Stanley Cohen, a South African sociologist who studied denial, called partial acknowledgment. They will recognize some problems with the CIA's program, but excuse these as mistakes or accidents that occurred, as Brennan said, early in the program's development. They may also, though they haven't yet, blame particularly unskilled, unprofessional, or even rogue interrogators for using unauthorized practices, much as the Department of Defense did to defuse Abu Ghraib. Doing so, they'll try to inoculate  enhanced interrogation  against its own excesses. What they likely won't do is admit and defend the version of waterboarding described by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Indeed, so much will depend on suppressing the image of Abu Zubaydah unconscious on the board, water bubbling out of his lungs or stomach.<br />  <br /> Waterboarding cannot bear itself. It never could, which is likely why the CIA destroyed videotapes of the practice's use and supporters have described it in such a misleading way. Now, thanks to the release of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report, we finally know why. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 23:07:29 -0500"	"politics"
"Contrasting Cruz and Warren-Pelosi Budget Battles: Why Democrats Have High Political Ground in 2016"	"Over the last week we have seen played out in the national political spotlight the fundamental reason why Democrats have the high political ground in 2016.  <br /> <br /> Senator Ted Cruz used every procedural move available to block Senate consideration of the  CRomnibus  appropriation bill that he demanded defund President Obama's Immigration Executive Actions. <br /> <br /> Senator Warren and House Leader Nancy Pelosi led campaigns to prevent inclusion of a provision to once again allow a federal bailout of big Wall Street banks that engage in the same kinds of risky investment schemes that precipitated the 2008 financial meltdown and the Great Recession. <br /> <br /> Neither side was successful in the legislative short run.   At the same time,  both sides engaged and motivated the bases of their respective parties with their stands.  <br /> <br /> But the similarities stop there.  These two battles are powerful illustrations of a major emerging fact in American politics.<br /> <br /> It is widely understood that the more GOP candidates for president adopt the priorities of the base of their party -- particularly hard-core opposition to immigration reform -- the more difficult it is for them to win general elections.   That's because hard-core stances against immigration reform, women's reproductive rights, gay rights, etc. alienate huge sections of the electorate that are required to win presidential elections.   That is especially true of socially moderate suburban women swing voters and elements of growing segments of the electorate like young people, single women, Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans and of course LGBT voters.<br /> <br /> What is not so widely understood is that by adopting the populist positions championed by the progressive base of the Democratic Party -- especially when it comes to raising the wages of ordinary Americans, reigning in Wall Street, and ending the widening chasm of income inequality -- Democrats are <em>more</em> likely to win general elections at all levels. <br /> <br /> Political consultant and former Senior Advisor to the President, David Axelrod, was asked Sunday on <em>Meet the Press</em> if the Democratic Party could accommodate both the Clintonites and the Warrenites.  He answered <em>absolutely</em> -- if Hilary Clinton moves to adopt the more populist position of the Warren wing of the party -- because those are the positions that will also increase Democratic chances of winning general elections. <br /> <br /> No one with an ounce of political sense would ever say that it makes Republican candidates more likely to win general elections if they adopt the radical positions of Ted Cruz.<br /> <br /> But the fact is that the core positions of the base of the Democratic Party are widely popular in America: raising the minimum wage, eliminating loopholes that allow employers to escape paying overtime to employees, raising the wages of the middle class, making student loans more affordable, regulating -- and even breaking up big Wall Street banks.   <br /> <br /> Even positions that used to be wedge issues in the Democratic coalition -- universal background checks for all gun purchasers, women's reproductive rights, sanctioning gay marriage, civil and voting rights -- receive overwhelming support among Democratic voters and majority support among swing voters. <br /> <br /> The more the Democratic Party reflects the values, priorities and policies of its progressive base the more likely it is to <em>win</em>.  The more the Republican Party reflects values, priorities and polities of its Tea Party conservative base, the more likely it is to <em>lose</em> -- it's that simple.<br /> <br /> This political reality reflects the basic underlying economic and social reality of 21st century American life.  Most Americans have experienced stagnant incomes for over three decades. Our Gross Domestic Product and productivity per person have gone up about 80 percent, but average incomes didn't go up 80 percent.  Instead nearly all of the increases went to the top two percent  -- and especially to the speculators on Wall Street. <br /> <br /> As a result today -- even after the shock of the Great Recession -- the stock market is at record highs, corporate profits are at record highs, and the share of national income going to wages is at a record low.<br /> <br /> The party who speaks to that fact, will have the support of the American people -- and the populist, progressive base of the Democratic Party does just that. <br /> <br /> There was a time, when many Americans understood that Republicans stood up for the rich and Democrats stood up for the average person.  Now, it is true that many people in the middle class believe that -- where <em>they</em> are concerned -- there isn't much of a difference.   Many understand that the Republicans stick up for the rich alright, but they also think Democrats only stick up for the very poor and their friends on Wall Street -- leaving them -- the people in the middle --  without a champion. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the more the Democratic Party adopts the populist, progressive, anti-Wall Street positions of its base, the more it attracts the middle class swing voters whose votes are critical in a general election. <br /> <br /> And, of course, these are exactly the same messages that motivate the party's progressive base to turn out in large numbers.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the messages that motivate the Republican base to turn out in large numbers do not have that effect on swing voters at all.  Sounding more like Ted Cruz might excite the GOP faithful, but it is frightening  to soccer moms and sounds down right strange to young people.  <br /> <br /> And something else is important to remember.  When swing voters don't believe that one of the two parties is their champion -- when they don't think there is a clear contrast when it comes to who is on their side -- they are much more likely to be open to try the opposition if they don't think things have been going so well for them under the current management. <br /> <br /> If voters don't think there is any more difference between Republicans and Democrats than there is between American and United Airlines, they make a simple and seemingly rational calculation: if my income hasn't gone up much under a Democratic president, might as well try a Republican president.  <br /> <br /> But that calculation changes enormously when they become convinced that one party is truly their champion and the other party is not. <br /> <br /> The populist economic message of Progressive Democrats is a huge winner when it comes to ordinary middle class voters who are just trying to live their lives and don't follow the ins and outs of politics every day.   And it makes them tune in.<br /> <br /> My wife, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, was approached as she was shopping by six ordinary customers at the Jewel Food Store -- and a sales clerk at Carson Pirie Scott Department store on Saturday after she voted with House Leader Pelosi to oppose the new Wall Street bailout that was included in last week's appropriation bill. All of them had been following the battle and thanked her for her vote.  This is not at all what ordinarily happens after a vote in Congress.  <br /> <br /> Washington insiders and pundits can go on until they are blue in the face trying to convince us that there is an equivalency of those who advocate for the values of the Tea Party on the GOP side, and the populist values of the progressive base of the Democrats on the other.  They would do well to get out more. <br /> <br /> <em>Robert Creamer is a long-time political organizer and strategist, and author of the book:  Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can Win, available on <a href= http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Your-Mother-Straight-Progressives/dp/0979585295%3FSubscriptionId%3D0JJEH4PKQM4ZHS8QY102%26tag%3Dthehuffingtop-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0979585295  target= _hplink >Amazon.com.</a> He is a partner in <a href= http://www.democracypartners.com  target= _hplink >Democracy Partners</a> and a Senior Strategist for <a href= http://www.americansunitedforchange.org  target= _hplink >Americans United for Change</a>.

The doors of the pale blue building haven't opened yet, and the new principal is hurriedly buttering toast in the kitchen for the students’ breakfasts. Teachers are scrambling to make last-minute adjustments to their classrooms, while anxious kids, ranging from pre-K students through high schoolers, wait on the porch, their jackets zipped against the chill of the early-morning air. It's all so incredibly normal, you might not know that, just a few years ago, no one thought Shishmaref would be here anymore.<br /> <br /> The remote village of 563 people is located 30 miles south of the Arctic Circle, flanked by the Chukchi Sea to the north and an inlet to the south, and it sits atop rapidly melting permafrost. In the last decades, the island's shores have been eroding into the sea, falling off in giant chunks whenever a big storm hits.<br /> <br /> The residents of Shishmaref, most of whom are Alaska Native Inupiaq people, have tried to counter these problems, moving houses away from the cliffs and constructing barriers along the northern shore to try to turn back the waves. But in July 2002, looking at the long-term reality facing the island, they <a href= http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/072102/ala_072102alapm0020001.shtml  target= _hplink >voted to pack up and move</a> the town elsewhere.<br /> <br /> Relocation has proven much more difficult than that single vote, however. And 12 years later, Shishmaref is still here, ready to begin another school year.<br /> <br /> There are obvious signs that something is amiss, however. One of the first things you see as you arrive in Shishmaref is a small wooden building propped precariously on the edge of the beach. A back corner dangles over the edge of an incline, the water lapping just a few feet away.<br />  <br /> <p>The town is built on a narrow spit of fine, silt-like sand just three miles long and a quarter-mile wide, surrounded on all sides by water. The only way in or out is by boat or plane, an hour-long flight from Nome that costs around $400 round-trip. A single, short paved road on the island starts just outside of town and leads to the airport; the rest of Shishmaref’s streets are sand. Most people get around on ATVs and dirt bikes, or snowmobiles in the winter.</p><br />  <br /> <em><p class= pull-quote  style= width: 90%; margin: 40px 3%; font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center; color: #000000; ><strong>Looking at the long-term reality facing the island, Shishmaref’s residents voted to pack up and move the town elsewhere. Twelve years later, they’re still here.</strong></p></em><br /> <br /> Most houses don't have running water or plumbing, so the town captures rain and snow for reuse, and most residents shower and do their laundry at the public washeteria. Full-time jobs are rare, and even part-time employment is hard to come by. Given the shrinking size of the island, there's not much room for new housing or facilities. In some homes, multiple generations crowd into small, single-story wooden structures. Most families rely on subsistence hunting, fishing and berry-picking to get through the year. The town is known throughout the region for producing seal oil and carvings from bone and ivory, which are sold to visitors and at gift shops in Nome.  <br /> <br /> Everything else on the island -- vehicles, food, construction supplies for houses -- must be shipped in. As a result, fresh food, aside from what they can hunt or pick, is rare, and prices at the general store would be outrageous to anyone from the lower 48 states: $14.76 for a can of Lysol, $21.61 for a package of six Huggies diapers, $7.40 for a box of Raisin Bran. Gasoline and heating oil are also shipped in at a premium, with a year's supply arriving each summer on a barge. A gallon will run you north of $6, and when supplies run out here, there is nothing until the barge returns.<br /> <br /> During my August visit, the island had exhausted the year's gasoline supply, and the next shipment wasn't expected for another week or two. Residents were forced to ration out what they used for their ATVs and motorboats. <br /> <br /> The island’s original name in the native language was “Kigiktaq,” and archaeological evidence of habitation dates back to the 1600s. The island is surrounded by what is now the <a href= http://www.nps.gov/bela/index.htm  target= _hplink >Bering Land Bridge National Preserve</a>, 2.7 million acres set aside as part of the National Park system to preserve the natural and archeological integrity of the entry point for North America’s first human residents. Russian explorers who arrived here in 1816 named the inlet “Shishmarev,” after the Russian navigator Glieb Semenovich Shishmarev, which would become the town’s name. The island opened a post office in 1901, <a href= http://www.kawerak.org/communities/shishmaref.html  target= _hplink >according to local history</a>, but the town wasn’t officially incorporated until 1969. <br /> <br /> Older photos of the island show wide, sandy beaches. Village elders remember playing tag and  Eskimo baseball” on the beach until late into the night, since the sun still shines well past 11 p.m. at the height of summer. <br /> <br />  There was a real big beach down there,  remembers Nora Kuzuguk, 67.  It was our playground. <br />  <br /> <p>Now, those beaches are rapidly disappearing.</p><br /> </div><br /> <br /> <div style= width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px; ><img style= width:100%  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371216/original.jpg  /><div class= feature-caption ><em>Older photos of the island show wide, sandy beaches.

But now climate change is exacerbating the problem considerably. Average temperatures are <a href= http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts-adaptation/alaska.html  target= _hplink >increasing faster in Alaska</a> than they are in the rest of the United States, warming 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years. The higher temperatures are causing the subsurface layer of permanently frozen soil typically found in the Arctic to thaw in some areas. This weaker permafrost is more vulnerable to storms and tidal activity, fueling the loss of Shishmaref's shores.<br /> <br /> Warmer temperatures have also shortened the amount of time the Chukchi Sea stays frozen each year, leaving the coastline exposed to fall and early winter storms. Now, during storms, the sand will  just melt with the water,  said Luci Eningowuk, 65. From 2004 to 2008 Eningowuk served as chair of the Shishmaref Erosion and Relocation Coalition, the group charged with developing and executing a plan for moving the town.  The waves would come and take a whole lot of the land. <br /> <br /> Fourteen houses on Shishmaref’s north side had to be put on skids and dragged down to the opposite end of the island after a major storm in October 1997. Another big storm in October 2001 sloughed off huge chunks of the northern shoreline.<br /> <br /> <p>Based on a comparison of aerial photos, the <a href= http://nome.colorado.edu/HARC/members/Scanned_docs/ArmyCorps_2006_ShishText.pdf  target= _hplink >Army Corps of Engineers estimates</a> that the island is losing between 2.7 and 8.9 feet a year, on average. But measurements in years with big storms have documented land loss of up to 22.6 feet.</p> <br />  <br /> <em><p class= pull-quote  style= width: 90%; margin: 40px 3%; font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center; color: #000000; ><strong> The waves would come and take a whole lot of the land. </strong></p></em><br /> <br /> When its residents voted to relocate, Shishmaref became a poster child for the impact of climate change. A <a href= http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts-adaptation/alaska.html  target= _hplink >webpage for the Environmental Protection Agency</a> describing climate change’s effects in Alaska includes a photo of one of the Shishmaref houses falling off a cliff.  Severe erosion has forced some Alaska Native Villages' populations to relocate in order to protect lives and property,  the website notes. But while Shishmaref and several other villages have tried to move, they've found that the reality of doing so is much more complicated.<br />  <br /> There’s a still too-prevalent idea in the United States that climate change is just a concept, an idea removed from us in  time, distance or economic circumstance. It’s something that might affect future generations or other nations.  Discussions about the current reality of climate change tend to focus on small island nations like Tuvalu, the Maldives or Kiribati, which are so threatened by rising seas that they’ve considered acquiring land on other continents so they can move their entire countries.<br /> <br /> But you don’t have to look elsewhere. Native communities along Alaska’s coast have been trying to tell us for more than a decade that climate change’s effects are already here. <br /> <br /> <p>If you believe the grim predictions of the latest climate science, Shishmaref is just the beginning. Towns in low-lying coastal plains and flood-prone river basins in the lower 48 may be next. A <a href= http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/cvi/  target= _hplink >study from the U.S. Geological Survey</a> warns that 50 percent of the U.S. coastline is at high or very high risk of impacts due to sea level rise; according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, <a href= http://stateofthecoast.noaa.gov/pop100yr/welcome.html  target= _hplink >16.4 million Americans</a> live in the coastal flood plain. If we can't figure out how to save a village with fewer than 600 people from falling into the sea, what hope is there for everyone else?</p> <br />  </div><br /> <br /> <div style= width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px; ><img style= width:100%  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2375072/original.jpg  /><div class= feature-caption ><em>It's obvious that something is wrong in Shishmaref.

Weyiouanna is the president of the board of the Shishmaref Native Corporation, which manages the land and resources allocated to the community under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. When the village first voted to relocate, he was tasked with heading up the effort as the technical staff assistant for the relocation coalition, which included representatives from the city council, the native government and the native corporation. At the time, Weyiouanna was working as the transportation planner for Kawerak, the regional economic and social development association, where he dealt with roads and other public works projects. <br /> <br /> Transportation planning is one thing. Planning to move a town is another.  I was like, 'How the heck am I going to do this?'  remembers Weyiouanna. We're sitting at his kitchen table drinking coffee as he recalls the relocation effort’s early days. He pauses occasionally to check a reindeer roast in the oven, and the smell, rich and earthy, fills the small house. One of his three children lounges on the couch in the adjoining living room, watching television.<br /> <br /> The coalition <a href= http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/climate-change/files/Arctic-Resources/Relocation-Plans/shishmaref%20relocation_plan_final_200211.doc  target= _hplink >put together a detailed action plan</a>, laying out for the community and for state and federal agencies what an “orderly relocation” would entail. Step one was to identify high-potential relocation sites, sizeable enough to accommodate the town’s growing population, with access to land and water and the hunting and fishing grounds on which the residents’ ancestors had relied for generations. The geography, hydrology and environmental suitability of the sites would be studied. The town would determine infrastructure needs for the new community, like an airport, roads, a clinic and a school. Finally, they would salvage what they could from Shishmaref and clean up the island after they left.<br /> <br /> All of this, of course, would require money. An <a href= http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/climate-change/files/Arctic-Resources/Relocation-Plans/USACE%20relocation%20plan_shishmaref%5B1%5D.pdf  target= _hplink >Army Corps of Engineers study</a> in 2004 estimated that relocating Shishmaref to the Alaska mainland would cost $179 million. Weyiouanna and other members of the coalition set about lobbying state and federal agencies for financial support. The town also created a website under the banner  We Are Worth Saving!  that pleaded for donations, technical assistance and grant-writing help from anyone willing to volunteer their time. <br /> <br /> Their efforts were aided by a flood of press attention following the town’s decision to relocate. Weyiouanna estimates that around 65 different news crews visited the island in 2003 and 2004 alone, from all over the lower 48 and the world. “To me they were a major player,” he said. “It was a tool for me to convince somebody from D.C., Juneau, Anchorage, that we needed assistance.”<br /> <br /> <div style= width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px; ><img style= width:100%  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371204/original.jpg  /><div class= feature-caption ><em>Tony Weyiouanna Sr. helped put the town's relocation plan together.  I was like, 'How the heck am I going to do this?'  he remembers. (Photo: Kate Sheppard/The Huffington Post)</em></div></div><br /> <br /> The town identified 11 possible relocation sites on the mainland, and preliminary assessments conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service helped the town narrow the list down to two sites.<br /> <br /> At a public meeting in December 2006, the village selected a site called Tin Creek, across the inlet from Shishmaref and less than 12 miles away, as their new home. The location was close enough that residents could still access their hunting and fishing sites by boat or snowmobile.<br /> <br /> Within a couple of years, however, the plan to move to Tin Creek fell apart. Subsequent feasibility studies revealed problems with the site. It too sits on permafrost -- which, in a melting Arctic, likely means that its days as a suitable location are also numbered. The town had to select a different location.<br /> <br /> Securing additional support from Washington was becoming more difficult, however. Ted Stevens, Alaska's powerful Republican senator and avid earmarker, had been a key player  in getting the town money for its erosion and relocation studies. But Democrats and Republicans in Washington were turning against earmarks -- the village's main source of funding this type of work. And when Stevens lost his re-election bid in 2008 amid a federal corruption trial, Shishmaref lost its greatest champion.<br /> <br /> <p> Stevens was our senator,  said Weyiouanna.  He's the one that set all this funding up for us. </p><br /> </div><br /> <br /> <div style= width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px; ><img style= width:100%  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371212/original.jpg  /><div class= feature-caption ><em>The residents of Shishmaref have moved houses away from the cliffs and constructed barriers, like this one, along the northern shore of the island to try to turn back the waves. (Photo: Kate Sheppard/The Huffington Post)</em></div></div><br /> <br /> <div class= feature-section ><br /> <br /> <span class= feature-dropcap >B</span>y this time, Shishmaref’s enthusiasm for relocation was flagging. The initial relocation plan had aimed to have the town moved by April 30, 2009, but early on it became clear that the process would likely take longer -- probably more like 10 or 15 years. To buy time, the town built a 200-foot-long sea wall to protect the island’s northern shore in 2004. Since then the wall has grown, with additional sections added in 2005 and 2007, extending it to 2,800 feet. <br /> <br /> The sea wall covers only a portion of the island, however, leaving important infrastructure like the airport, dump and a large section of the main road exposed. But Weyiouanna says it has given residents a false sense of security. He says he tried to warn other community leaders that “once we start building these sea walls, the community is going to get real comfortable with the protection of the sea wall, and pretty soon you're going to think that we don't need to relocate.”<br /> <br /> Even as it reinforced the northern shore, however, other parts of Shishmaref continued to wash away. And, having made the case for relocating, it became harder to acquire state or federal funding for projects on the island, like repairing the health clinic or building additional housing. <br /> <br />  It stopped all investment in this community,  said Percy Nayokpuk, owner of the island's general store, of the relocation plan. “There's been a lot of projects lost because of the vote to move. That's about all that's resulted from that vote.” <br /> <br /> City and tribal leaders say the relocation effort is largely dormant, for now. Residents who had been involved in the relocation plan said they just got busy with other things. One woman was diagnosed with cancer and had to take a break. Others said they became wrapped up with family or work, or just got frustrated with the insurmountable nature of the task. <br /> <br /> Weyiouanna, too, stepped down from his official position with the relocation coalition toward the end of 2007.  There was a pretty strong faction of people who were against the relocation project,” he said, including community members and other local leaders.  So it just got miserable for me.  <br /> <br /> Shishmaref had tried to move before, and changed its mind then as well. Two storms in 1973 damaged the island, after which the community decided to relocate to the mainland. But the town later reconsidered, choosing instead to build a wall of sandbags along the northern coast to fortify it against the waves. Nayokpuk worked on the relocation effort the first time around, back when he was a young man just out of college. Marshalling the support and resources to move was a challenge then, too.<br /> <br /> Today the residents of Shishmaref are largely split on whether to move. In 2002, only about 11 percent of the town’s residents voted against the relocation plan, according to local news accounts. Many of the  no  votes were village elders, who felt that staying was important to protecting their way of life. The island’s remoteness has kept it unique, preserving the Inupiaq language and culture. Now Weyiouanna estimates that only about half of the town’s residents want to move, and the other half would prefer to stay as long as they can. <br /> <br />  I voted to move,  said Nora Kuzuguk, 67.  But now -- not really, I don’t want to move away from Shishmaref. It's unique. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tocktoo, 53, the town’s former mayor and another advocate for relocation, says he thinks they could still convince residents to move if they had a destination. “They would, I think, but we don't know where would be a suitable place,” he replied. “We need to find a new site.”<br /> <br /> When I met Kuzuguk’s son, Richard, he was in the mayor’s office, tendering  his official resignation from the city council. In addition to serving on the council, Kuzuguk has been Shishmaref’s environmental coordinator for the last five years, leading recycling efforts from the basement of the church. He has also been involved in the ongoing campaign against Arctic drilling, and was part of the relocation planning committee in its early stages.<br /> <br /> But now Kuzuguk, 51, and his family are packing up and moving out, bound for Nome, where he's been offered a job doing maintenance at the hospital. It's a full-time position, unlike his current post, and offers benefits.<br /> <br /> For Kuzuguk, Nome is a place where he can see a future for his family. I'd met one of his six children, Lydia, on my first day in town. The gregarious 11-year-old introduced herself during movie night in the school gym, volunteering that she was moving to Nome in a few days.<br /> <br />  I have to consider my children's future,  said Kuzuguk.  The best way I can do that right now is to move to Nome, get started there, introduce them to the Western lifestyle. They can always come back and learn the subsistence, traditional lifestyle. <br /> <br /> <p>It's just too complicated to move an entire town, Kuzuguk decided.  For us to teach Congress why we want to ... my opinion is that's an impossible, losing battle,  he said.</p><br /> </div>  <br /> <br /> <div style= width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px; ><img style= width:100%  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2370110/original.jpg  /><div class= feature-caption ><em> I voted to move,  said Nora Kuzuguk, 67.

But it's also Kivalina and Newtok, too, and nine other native villages that, facing  the impacts of warmer temperatures and changing conditions as an immediate threat, have elected to relocate. The Government Accountability Office has found that <a href= http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-551  target= _hplink >most of the 200 Alaska Native villages</a> are experiencing flooding and erosion related to climate change.<br /> <br /> Of these villages, Newtok is the closest to actually moving. They were able to find and agree upon new land, and secure funding from state and federal agencies to start construction. Political disputes in the town, however, have<a href= http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/05/alaska-newtok-climate-change  target= _hplink > put the actual move on indefinite hold</a> there.<br /> <br /> There's no playbook for moving a town. There’s no government agency, at either the state or federal level, that is in charge of such a process. There’s no pool of money set aside to help communities. There are no rules for picking another location, or packing lists for what to take. Each community has been left to come up with its own plan. <br /> <br />  They’re doing all they can on their own,  said Robin Bronen, executive director of the Alaska Immigration Justice Project and perhaps the region's leading researcher of climate-related migration. Bronen has followed several of these communities as they try to navigate this seemingly impossible situation.  I don’t think that folks outside of Alaska understand how incredible it is that these communities with such limited resources have been taking on a Goliath effort to educate people in Congress, in the state about their needs. <br />  <br /> <p>Bronen worries that soon it won't be just Alaska Native villages that are looking to move -- it will be other coastal cities in the U.S.  My mantra is: we need to get a relocation institutional framework in place now,  said Bronen.  This does not bode well for other places in the world that are going to be faced with this issue. </p><br />  <br /> <em><p class= pull-quote  style= width: 90%; margin: 40px 3%; font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center; color: #000000; ><strong> I don’t think that folks outside of Alaska understand how incredible it is that these communities with such limited resources have been taking on a Goliath effort. </strong></p></em><br /> <br /> In November 2013, President Barack Obama <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/01/obama-climate-change_n_4191913.html  target= _hplink >announced a new executive order</a> directing federal agencies to revise programs and policies that hinder climate adaptation, and created a Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience that brings together state, local and tribal leaders to collaborate on strategies for addressing the impacts of climate change.<br /> <br /> Last month, that <a href= http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/task_force_report_0.pdf  target= _hplink >task force recommended</a> that the administration  explore [the] Federal role in addressing climate change-related displacement,  echoing Bronen’s concern that the plight of communities like Shishmaref will spread to “every region of the country and U.S. affiliated jurisdictions.” In short, the task force stated, we need to come up with a way to deal with this problem -- and fast.<br /> <br /> Reggie Joule, the mayor of the Northwest Arctic Borough and a former Alaska state representative representing Shishmaref's district, was the sole Alaska Native representative on the task force. When asked about the task force’s recommendations, Joule acknowledged that simply  exploring  the federal government's role in relocation projects  doesn't go far enough, because our local communities don’t have the capacity to do anything.  But he was, overall, grateful that Shishmaref and other Alaska Native villages finally seem to be on the federal government’s radar. To  be included in the recommendations the way that we are,  said Joule,  is a huge step forward, because we had very little before. <br /> <br />  We're not talking about highly populated areas. So we're easy to overlook,  said Joule.  To people who are 7,000 miles away from where the action is, what they know and what they understand are two different things. You can know that communities are eroding, but do we really understand what that means, the timeline and how vulnerable the communities are? … When you send the pictures and put together a proposal, we're just facts and figures on paper. And is there anybody back there [in Washington] who understands the urgency of the information in front of them? <br /> <br /> The Department of Interior has provided some support for the sea wall project in the past, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. And it is working on an Integrated Arctic Management approach to bridge agency work on Arctic issues. But one of the biggest challenges at the federal level is that many of the programs that could provide assistance to a village like Shishmaref require matching local funds -- which are often nonexistent. Jessica Kershaw, press secretary for the Department of Interior, told HuffPost that the department “has been coordinating with other federal agencies to evaluate the efforts that should be undertaken in situations like those facing Shishmaref” and will  continue working with a broad coalition of stakeholders to identify a path forward.”<br /> <br /> The Army Corps of Engineers, too, has played a key role in conducting early evaluations of relocation options, as well as funding and support for sea wall construction. But the Corps' work is limited to what Congress has authorized and funded, and that work also requires some level of cost-sharing from a local partner. Bruce Sexauer, chief of planning for the Army Corps' Alaska district office, said the corps is currently considering funding for additional relocation or reinforcement studies for Shishmaref as part of its budget request for next year -- but it’s unclear whether they will get it.<br /> <br /> There are federal offices, like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but their role is mostly limited to providing support after disaster strikes.  If you look at the process, I think we're really good at reacting to things. That's why we have FEMA,  said Joule.  But in order to address the things that FEMA may have to deal with, I'm not sure how good we are at planning. <br /> <br /> The Obama administration has also taken strides to address climate change around the globe. In September, the president ordered all federal agencies to  factor climate resilience into the design of their international development programs and investments.  And in November, the administration announced that it was <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/14/obama-green-climate-fund_n_6159136.html  target= _hplink >contributing $3 billion to an international fund</a> designed to help developing nations deal with climate change.<br /> <br /> Officials from the Department of Interior and the White House Office of Management and Budget also traveled to Shishmaref last summer. But the continued lack of major action to help the village has prompted an outcry from Alaska's senior Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski.  At the same time your administration has been unwilling to commit the resources to help a community such as Shishmaref, it is prioritizing funding to assist Vietnam with climate adaptation,  Murkowski <a href= http://www.murkowski.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=8c3f7f81-7732-4cf1-8b72-056974b73fc9  target= _hplink >wrote in a letter to Obama in January</a>.  I ask that you put America first, especially the Alaskans who deal with this reality on a daily basis.”<br /> <br /> Michael Boots, the acting chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, <a href= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BootsMurkowskiletter.pdf  target= _hplink >responded to Murkowski’s letter</a> in May, saying that the office is “looking into how we can best address” the requests from Shishmaref. Boots noted that many of the programs that could provide assistance “may be challenging to access” for the community because of requirements for cost-sharing, but said that the administration is “committed to identifying available options” within existing executive authority. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile in Alaska, villages are starting to wonder whether moving is even a realistic option.  We're working hard to move a community. That's what we're planning for,  said Joule.  Is that even in the cards? Is that an option that somebody has the authority to say, 'Yes, we can do this' and is willing to do that? <br />  <br /> <p> We have taken temporary measures,  he said,  but we're talking about people's lives here. </p><br /> </div><br /> <br /> <div style= width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px; ><img style= width:100%  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2370102/original.jpg  /><div class= feature-caption ><em> I have to consider my children's future,  said Richard Kuzuguk.

His house was one of the ones dragged to the other end of the island after the 1997 storm destroyed the northern coast. He was in his house through the storm.  It was pretty loud,  he remembered.  I could feel the ground shake.  Now 17 years later, he said,  I miss hearing the ocean. <br /> <br /> Howard is Tony's cousin, and Weyiouanna is one of the more common family names in town. When we met in the city council building, Howard expressed optimism about recent investments in the town. After years with little government funding, the town is finally getting new housing thanks to a grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. They're putting the final touches on seven new houses, modest beige buildings with brown trim that, unlike most residences in town, will have running water and flush toilets. His adult daughter, Nellie, and his three grandkids are moving into one of them. The health clinic is also being remodeled, finally.<br /> <br /> But a number of problems still require attention. For one, the city government building isn't up to fire code. And they need a bigger water storage system. Most of the town relies on the reservoir, which collects snow melt, but the population has grown and that's no longer enough. They also need a new washeteria, and larger, stronger bulk storage tanks for the fuel shipped to the island.<br /> <br /> Such upgrades might be interpreted as signs that the community isn’t going anywhere -- at least not anytime soon. But one thing that worries the mayor is the road that leads to the dump, past the airport at the far western end of the island. The island's remoteness means that pretty much everything that comes in, stays in. The dump, located at the farthest end of the island, is filled with remnants of refrigerators, barrels, household trash, an old truck. And since most houses lack indoor plumbing, the dump is also where human waste is deposited in a large lagoon. A storm in November 2013 washed out several big chunks of the road, taking out 50 feet of earth in some places and making the dump nearly inaccessible.<br /> <br /> The town rerouted the road around the washout. But everyone knows it's a temporary solution.  Apparently it is going to breach again,  Weyiouanna said.<br /> <br /> Losing the road to the dump alone would be bad enough, but of more concern is the sea’s encroachment on the end of the runway. More than a place to land planes, it's the town's lifeline, bringing in food, supplies and people. And it's the only way out if there's an evacuation. In previous storms, the water's high point has crept as close as 75 feet from the landing strip. <br /> <br /> <p> With no protection on it, it's going to hit the runway,  said Weyiouanna.</p><br /> <br /> <em><p class= pull-quote  style= width: 90%; margin: 40px 3%; font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center; color: #000000; ><strong>Climate change makes the prospect of a big storm and emergency evacuation more a matter of when, not if.<br /><br />  Once they get evacuated,  said Kuzuguk,  nobody's going to be allowed to come back to the island. </strong></p></em><br /> <br /> Ideally, he says, they'd find more money to extend the sea wall to protect the rest of the northern shore.  It would buy us some time,  he said,  but I can't say for how long. <br /> <br /> Indeed, climate change makes the prospect of a big, dangerous storm -- and emergency evacuation -- more a matter of when, not if. Such a disaster would likely mark the end of Shishmaref as an independent village, Kuzuguk said.<br /> <br />  Once they get evacuated, nobody's going to be allowed to come back to the island,  he said. They would become refugees, in Nome, or Fairbanks or Anchorage.<br /> <br /> That's the one thing many in Shishmaref would like to avoid. The whole point of kicking off a relocation plan, after all, was to ensure that Shishmaref could still be a village -- just somewhere else. By moving together, they hoped, they could safeguard the things that make them unique, like their subsistence lifestyle and customs.<br /> <br /> Kuzuguk isn't optimistic on that point, not anymore.  I don't think there's enough reasonable people that know we have to relocate by choice, rather than being forced to by evacuation. By choice, we could still retain our identity, as a culture, as a community,  he said.  But unless we're willing to do it ourselves, it's not going to happen. <br /> <br /> Tony Weyiouanna Sr., despite his past frustrations with the relocation process, hasn’t given up.  “I still believe in it. I still tell people I think we need to relocate,” he said. “I still think it's important to have some spokesperson to go out there, to keep telling the stories, to pass on your experiences, let people know that the assistance is still needed.”<br /> <br /> He has a new idea, one he pitched to lawmakers, agency heads and White House officials during a trip to Washington earlier this year. Instead of moving the whole town, maybe they could try a pilot relocation project, he said, with  only the group who really wanted to move. <br /> <br /> He’s still trying to figure out exactly how many people would need to volunteer  in order to qualify for state and federal support to build a new health clinic and a new school. But a pilot move like this, he believes, would work out the complicated issues, like finding a viable location, and would provide a road map for other communities as they face the same challenge. And it would cost about half of what they projected a bigger move would cost.<br /> <br />  We just have to do the planning,  he told me.  We just have to start over and do the planning.  <br /> <br /> <p>He thinks they could make it work, maybe in a year or two years.  Everybody else will follow eventually. </p><br /> </div><br /> <br /> <style type= text/css >.articleBody div.feature-section, .entry div.feature-section{width:55%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;} .articleBody span.feature-dropcap, .entry span.feature-dropcap{float:left;font-size:72px;line-height:59px;padding-top:4px;padding-right:8px;padding-left:3px;} div.feature-caption{font-size:90%;margin-top:0px;}</style><br /> <br /> <center><em>Enjoy reading this article?

"The Budget Deal and the Run-Up to 2016"	"In principle, Saturday's vote to keep the government open should be the perfect curtain-raiser for the political debates between now and the 2016 election. As their price for averting a government shutdown, Republicans demanded and got a gutting of one of the most important provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, preventing banks from speculating with government insured money.<br /> <br /> Agencies hated by Republicans such as the Environmental Protection Agency took big cuts, and a rider was inserted permitting  mountaintop removal  coal mining once again. Another extraneous provision demanded by conservatives permits massive increase in individual campaign contributions. <br /> <br /> The IRS enforcement budget lost $345.6 million. This will only increase public deficits, since most IRS enforcement is directed at upper-bracket tax cheats. The IRS collects about seven dollars for every dollar it spends on audits.<br /> <br /> The bill also cuts Pell grants for lower income college students, diverting money to the for-profit companies that function as collection agencies for student loans. And it allows companies to cut pensions for current retirees, even those that are contractually guaranteed.<br /> <br /> This deal was cut by the outgoing Congress, in which Democrats still controlled the Senate. Far worse will be directed at ordinary working families when the new Congress meets in January.<br /> <br /> So a terrific debate is set in motion for the next two years, smoking out which side the Republicans are really on. Right?<br /> <br /> Well, no. <br /> <br /> If only. For in the great budget sellout of December 2014, fully 57 House Democrats voted with the Republicans to narrowly pass this deal. Key Senate Democrats close to Wall Street, such as Chuck Schumer of New York, were its enablers. <br /> <br /> In the end game, President Obama, continuing his signature fighting style, blinked first. He evidently feared that another government shutdown would be blamed more on him than on the Republicans; or that even worse would be in store after January. The Republicans, once again, played chicken and prevailed.<br /> <br /> So we were treated to a spectacle of the Democrats being split several ways, both on ideology and on tactics. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, a progressive, after sending mixed signals earlier in the week, decided that the bill had to be opposed. But President Obama, his chief of staff Denis McDonough, along with Pelosi's more conservative second-in-command, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, actively lobbied Democrats to back the deal. So in the end the 57 House Democrats, about one-third of the Caucus, joined 162 Republicans to narrowly pass the budget.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, over on the Senate side, the Democrats split as well. Only six Democratic progressives led by Elizabeth Warren voted against cloture. Then, once the bill was assured of passing, several Wall Street-friendly Democrats from relatively liberal states cast a crocodile-tears record vote against, such as Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey.<br /> <br /> So, while the Democratic Party should be carrying the banner of working families, making it clear that the rules are rigged against regular people and that Republicans are the riggers-in-chief, the reality is far more blurred. The Democrats not only lost this vote on issues they allegedly care about; they lost their role as a credible opposition. <br /> <br /> As George Orwell wrote in the famous ending of <em>Animal Farm</em>, The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which. <br /> <br /> Well, there is this comfort: At least the Democrats' likely nominee in 2016 stands four square with ordinary Americans against Wall Street... Uh, whoops. The greater likelihood, of course, is that the Clinton-Obama-Rubin dynasty will continue with another Clinton, and the blur will continue.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the drumbeat urging Elizabeth Warren to run for president only grows louder. <br /> <br /> I am often asked if I'd support a third party. I always respond that I'd be thrilled with a second party.<br /> <br /> <em>Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect, a visiting professor at Brandeis University's Heller School, and a senior Fellow at Demos.

"From Torturing to Killing Innocent People: This Is Who We Are"	"Following the long awaited release of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's  Committee Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program,  President Barack Obama proclaimed,  Throughout our history, the United States of America has done more than any other nation to stand up for freedom, democracy, and the inherent dignity and human rights of people around the world. At the same time, some of the actions that were taken were contrary to our values. <br /> <br /> Obama would ultimately conclude,  No nation is perfect.  But one of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better.  Rather than another reason to refight old arguments, I hope that today's report can help us leave these techniques where they belong--in the past.  Today is also a reminder that upholding the values we profess doesn't make us weaker, it makes us stronger and that the United States of America will remain the greatest force for freedom and human dignity that the world has ever known. <br /> <br /> I include these lengthy remarks because this is not an analysis of the findings detailed in the torture report. There are plenty of articles that detail such analysis. Rather, this is a call for an end to the high-minded, sanctimonious rhetoric that we are constantly bombarded with.  I am tired of listening to our officials say things that are simply and obviously in direct contradiction with what we actually do. Enough is enough. It is time to stop pretending we are something that we are not. <br /> <br /> President Obama claimed that some of the actions that were taken (note past tense), were contrary to our values. What seems to be lost on the President is that values are not something one professes; values are established through one's actions. Under the Bush administration, torture was systematic, brutal, widespread, and patently illegal. <br /> <br /> Morally, our professed values would require nothing less than the absolute banishment of every single individual responsible for the torture program. Those responsible should never again be allowed to appear on the Sunday morning political shows to tout their  expertise.   No longer should these individuals be given a soapbox to stand on to profess that they did nothing wrong or that what they did was necessary. <br /> <br /> The only box those responsible for torture should be given is the witness box. Our professed values and our legal obligations require that those responsible for the torture program be prosecuted and, if guilty, punished. The United Nations Convention against Torture requires the prosecution of individuals for torture when there is sufficient evidence for doing so. Clearly, there is no shortage of evidence. <br /> <br /> While sitting before the UN Committee against Torture, Mary McLeod, Principal Deputy Legal Advisor at the Department of State, said,  As President Obama has acknowledged, we crossed the line and we take responsibility for that.  I'm not sure where McLeod gets her definition of  responsibility.  My understanding is that taking responsibility requires more than simply saying the word. Yet, consistent with his previous decision to  look forward, not backwards,  Obama wants to leave all this immorality and criminality  in the past. <br /> <br /> It is almost comical how President Obama pretends that the only actions taken since the tragic attacks on 9/11 that undermine our professed values occurred during President Bush's terms in office. Despite Obama's repeated claims that he  ended  torture, his administration continued to imprison individuals in Afghan detention facilities fully aware of the systematic torture that was taking place at the facilities. There is also the ongoing force-feeding of hunger strikers at Guantanamo Bay. Jon Eisenberg, a human rights attorney who defends one of the prisoners, believes that when combining the varied practices associated with the force-feeding of detainees,  it all adds up to torture.  Obama simultaneously claims that force-feeding is humane and refuses to allow the video footage of force-feeding to be viewed by the public. <br /> <br /> We know from the torture report, innocent people were detained and tortured. We also know that innocent people have been killed by President Obama's drone strike program. Perhaps it was overlooked or maybe it was simply ignored, but the UK-based human rights NGO Reprieve published a report at the end of November. Reprieve investigated the numerous attempts to kill individuals labeled high-value targets. Its findings demonstrate the moral depravity of President Obama's drone strike program.<br /> <br /> According to the report,  In Pakistan, 24 men were reported as killed or targeted multiple times. Missed strikes on these men killed 874 people, including 142 children. In Yemen, 17 men were reported killed or targeted multiple times. Missile strikes on these men killed 273 others and accounted for almost half of all confirmed civilian casualties and 100% of all recorded child deaths. In targeting Ayman al Zawahiri, the CIA killed 76 children and 29 adults....It took the US six attempts to kill Qari Hussain, a Pakistani target. During these attempts, 128 people were killed, including 13 children. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that the drone strike program kills innocent people. Just as the interrogation methods (torture) used by the Bush administration were immoral and illegal, so too are the methods President Obama employs in his drone strike program. The Obama administration has repeatedly attacked first responders and rescuers when they converge on the scene of an initial attack. Those attending funerals have also been attacked. President Obama has personally authorized the use of  signature  strikes, which are strikes launched without first determining whether the person(s)  deserved  to die. In the process, President Obama has violated international humanitarian law and human rights law, and has arbitrarily killed hundreds, if not thousands, of innocents.<br /> <br /> These are our values because our values are defined not by what we say, but by what we do. American exceptionalism, a favored claim of President Obama's, has nothing to do with our  willingness to openly confront our past.  It is a catchall justification for our immoral and illegal actions around the world. We can either accept this reality and stop pretending we are something that we are not or we can be part of a movement that accepts nothing less than bringing our actions in line with our professed values.

"The Detainee Abuse Photos Obama Didn't Want You To See - The Daily Beast"	"The Obama administration is withholding hundreds, perhaps even thousands of photographs showing the U.S. government’s brutal treatment of detainees, meaning that revelations about detainee abuse could well continue, possibly compounding the outrage generated by the Senate “torture report” now in the public eye.

"Sign of the Times: Local Governments Cross the Line With Signage Restrictions"	"In the Chicago suburb of Downers Grove, all signs are limited in size and style.<br /> <br /> They have to be -- <a href= http://www.downers.us/public/docs/code/Chapter28.pdf  target= _hplink >unless</a> they're political. Or government owned. Or highlight real estate, birthdays, or any village-sponsored or approved event or national holiday. <br /> <br /> That's not by accident. In 2005, Downers Grove Village Council passed strict and specific requirements for anyone wishing to display signage within the village.<br />  <br /> Content-based restrictions like the ones that exist in Downers Grove are at issue in the soon-to-be-heard Supreme Court case <a href= http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/reed-v-town-of-gilbert-arizona/  target= _hplink >Reed v. Gilbert</a>, a case out of Gilbert, Arizona, that also stems from city rules on signs. <br /> <br /> Pastor Clyde Reed, the plaintiff in this case, presides over Good News Community Church, which rents temporary spaces for worship services. The church uses roadside signs to advertise service locations, but the town of Gilbert's sign regulations only allow the church to display notices up to 12 hours before, during and one hour after the service ends.   <br /> <br /> That's the rule for all  non-commercial event signs.  Other signs are not treated the same way - for example, <a href= http://www.gilbertaz.gov/home/showdocument?id=1494  target= _hplink >Gilbert's rules</a> allow for political signs to go up 60 days before an election. <br /> <br /> The plaintiffs in the case say the town's rules don't treat all people - and signs - equally. <br /> <br /> The same inequitable treatment is present in Downers Grove, as well.<br /> <br /> Robert Peterson owns Leibundguth Moving & Storage Inc., a business that has been headquartered in Downers Grove for about 80 years. For more than 70 years, the business has boasted a hand-painted sign on the back of its brick building. <br /> <br /> This sign is important because it is visible from BNSF Metra trains, which haul thousands of commuters to and from Chicago each day. Peterson estimates this sign pulls in 12 to 15 customers each month, accounting for about $40,000 to $60,000 in business each year. Downers Grove's rules not only limit the size of signs Peterson is allowed to display, but also makes it illegal to have a sign facing the Metra tracks - the same would not be true if he wanted to display a sign advertising the sale of a property or a political campaign.<br /> <br /> Essentially, the village has given Peterson and other business owners a ridiculous choice: acquiesce to strict advertising restrictions or face steep fines. Leibundguth alone could be hit with fines of $50-$750 daily for as long as its signs aren't in compliance with city law. <br /> <br /> If these sign restrictions don't already strike you as arbitrary, consider this: Peterson's business is just one block away from a different zoning district in which his signs would be legal.<br /> <br /> The gaping flaws in Gilbert and Downers Grove's sign laws don't mean local officials are bad people with malevolent aims -- presumably, they did this with the best intentions. Doug Kozlowski, Downers Grove's director of communications, noted that some of the goals of the ordinance include preserving the value of private property and enhancing the physical appearance of the village. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this is simply not the village's business. These sign rules make local boards seem more like a busybody homeowner's association and less like a local government. <br /> <br /> In Peterson's case, the effect of eliminating his historic sign would mean his mom-and-pop shop would suffer the loss of a huge business generator and therefore a large chunk of income. A handful of businesses, including Best Buy and Kohl's, <a href= http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/downers-grove-darien-westmont-woodridge/ct-sign-ordinance-downers-grove-tl-0807-20140806-story.html  target= _hplink >petitioned</a> to keep their signs. Interestingly, while Peterson's petition to keep his existing sign was denied by village officials, Art Van Furniture, a large Chicago chain, was granted an exemption from the rules. The village also gave the company <a href= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-13/news/ct-tl-downers-grove-art-van-20131113_1_art-van-downers-grove-oks-furniture-store  target= _hplink >hefty tax subsidies</a>. <br /> <br /> These inconsistent and burdensome sign rules are an example of local government grossly overstepping its bounds. Maintaining comely local signage is not a core government service -- it is a way for local officials to impose their tastes and values on the public. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 21:27:13 -0500"	"politics"
"The Ezell Ford Autopsy Report Casts Another Glare on the Autopsy Debate"	"The slaying of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Ezell Ford have one other thing in common other than they were unarmed black males slain by police officers and their killings ignited a national furor. Their autopsies have been the subject of intense scrutiny, debate, controversy and disbelief. Prosecutors and family attorneys heatedly dueled over the two Brown autopsies, one official, and one independent that proved and disproved whether Brown was shot and killed after an in close battle with Darren Wilson or at a distance. The Garner and Rice killings were both ruled a homicide based on their autopsy findings. Yet the ruling and the autopsy findings weren't enough to sway a prosecutor and a grand jury to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo who killed Garner. There's absolutely no guarantee that the autopsy report and ruling in Rice's case will force an indictment of the Cleveland cop that killed him either. <br /> <br /> Now there's Ezell Ford. Virtually the instant the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner completed a preliminary autopsy on the Ford killing the LAPD sought and got an  administrative hold  on the public release of the autopsy's result. This outraged civil rights leaders and Ford family members screamed that the freeze on release was a clumsy attempt to cover-up and whitewash Ford's killing, LAPD officials countered that the hold was simply to prevent  tainting  the investigation with after the fact witness testimony.<br /> <br /> The autopsy is crucial to the case but it is guaranteed to raise as many questions as it seeks to answer. One question is exactly what will the Ford autopsy show? The other is what if it backs the officer's version that Ford was killed after a struggle or it contradicts it and shows as some witness's claim he was on the ground and not resisting? Yet another is will it really prove anything or simply stir more controversy and skepticism about it whichever way it goes?<br /> <br /> The reason for skepticism is probably the easiest to understand. Autopsies are performed by county medical examiners and even with competent and professional medical examiners, police and prosecutors may exert undue influence on their findings by sharing theories of a crime or information about a suspect, which may lead pathologists to tailor their conclusions to fit the theory of law enforcement officials rather than the facts of a case. This was tested to the limit in the Brown slaying. His family believed that the St. Louis County Medical Examiner was so in lock step with police officials that they didn't trust the examiner to objectively present any facts about the cause of Brown's death that would fly in the face of the version given by police. They got a private autopsy and not surprisingly it contradicted the official version of the killing. Then it quickly became a case of dueling autopsies that purported to show different versions of how Brown died at Wilson's hands.<br /> <br /> This points to the problem of what and how an autopsy is conducted. A number of chief medical examiners, even official examiners, have been fiercely critical of the entire autopsy process. Glenn Larkin, a former chief medical examiner in Pennsylvania, quipped that with an autopsy  We're one step removed from God and St. Michael.  His point was that an autopsy even when there is no controversy or charge of bias hardly provides fool proof evidence of how a death occurred.  Autopsy critics point to questionable forensic methodology such as bullet lead comparison, dog scent lineups, bite mark comparison, and even fingerprint and DNA analysis. In other cases, medical examiners apparently have made up their  expert  conclusions, which have no scientific basis.<br /> <br /> Constantine Gatsonis, director of the Center for Statistical Sciences at Brown University and co-chair of the committee that authored a National Academy of Sciences report on flaws in autopsy reporting noted.  Much research is needed not only to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of current forensic methods but also to innovate and develop them further.  <br /> <br /> It makes little difference how erroneous or flawed an autopsy is the likelihood that it will be questioned is slim precisely because is viewed as an incontrovertible scientific medical examination. It ignores the fact that in many cases a pathologist's determination as to how a person died is simply an opinion.  <br /> <br /> A completely unbiased, untainted, factual autopsy that directly brands a death in an officer involved shooting as a homicide becomes a moot exercise if judges, juries and even defense attorneys ignore the findings even when there is clear evidence of improper influence by police or prosecutors.<br /> <br /> The Ezell Ford autopsy may be the paragon of medical scientific accuracy and tell exactly how Ford was killed and support or contradict the LAPD version of the killing. But that will hardly be the end of it. It will simply cast another glare on the autopsy debate.<br /> <br /> --<br /> <br /> <em>Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

"Bush-Cheney Legacy: More War, More Torture, Fewer Jobs?"	"<img alt= 2014-05-05-BothSides_WebsiteBanner_728x90_041421.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-05-BothSides_WebsiteBanner_728x90_041421.jpg  width= 560  /><br /> <br /> <p><strong>LISTEN HERE:</strong><br /> <center><script src= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/include/audio_player.php?audio_file= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/121514.mp3  type= text/javascript ></script></center></p><br /> <br /> By Mark Green<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Frum and Corn agree that the Feinstein Committee documents  torture  and should have been released but they clash on justifications for the torture. Ditto on Bush-Cheney legacy since, argues Frum,  safety is the goal of the state.  Also: why can't Obama get any economic respect? </strong></em><br /> <br /> <strong>On Senate Torture Report. </strong>The Davids -- Corn and Frum -- agree that the Senate Report does document instances of what can be defined as torture. But Frum explains that, like the start of Civil War, Korean War, WW I and II, bad things happen during the early panic of war because of a 'safety first' ethic to protect the country. Corn, however, rejects that the U.S. previously as matter of policy engaged in torture since  the laws of war were still observed  and we prosecuted/executed some Japanese generals for waterboarding. Also: Corn emphasizes that the Army Field Manual explicitly prohibits it; the Senate Report began on a 14-1 bi-partisan vote after the Agency destroyed videotapes of torture and was released with 9-6 vote; the FBI refused to do what CIA did. <br /> <br /> <em>Is the cost to America's reputation not the Report's release but the practice of torture itself? Does the release enhance accountability so that future presidents are unlikely to do this again? </em>Frum agrees that release was appropriate because  people learn lessons about going too far... but the person affected is more likely to be someone in the field than a president.  <br /> <br /> <em>You agree then that it's important to have a strict rule against torture but if there's a one-in-a-million Jack Bauer-like hypothetical horrible, then a president or local interrogator will have to decide whether to violate the rule and accept the consequences?</em> Lincoln said,  do you not amputate the leg to save the body?  when he suspended Habeas during the Civil War. There seems to be an uneasy consensus about an anti-torture rule with a ticking nuc bomb opt-out. (Calling John Grisholm.)<br /> <br /> But there's no consensus on whether this report will now forever tar Bush-Cheney historically as torturers... the way we largely associate Hoover with  Depression  and Nixon with  Watergate Resignation . Corn says,  This is merely another chapter in the narrative of their misguided war that will haunt them,  but Frum, who was a W. speechwriter, adds,  Yes it will be part of the legacy but in the context of how it kept us safer.  He along with a decade of CIA chiefs believe it was effective; a Senate Report of 6000 pages based on 6 million documents, believes that it was not. Concludes Senator Whitehouse,  wrong and not useful is a tough combination. <br /> <br /> <em>Last, does Senate Report show how impossible it is to have congressional oversight over such a secret national security agency?</em> Corn thinks there's an inevitable tension between democracy and secrecy, though Frum argues that this painful Senate oversight document shows that it can work.  This is what a self-correcting system looks like. <br /> <br /> <em>Host: Let's not have historical amnesia here.<br /> <br /> From Gen. George Washington and then through 43 presidents, torture has been regarded as immoral and recently illegal based on the Geneva accords signed by President Ronald Reagan. Now defenders say that this enemy is, what, worse than the Nazis so they deserve a lower standard? That what al Qaeda did on 9/11 is worse than what we did to them (so beheading is now our measure of conduct)? That it was effective (which the Senate report disagrees with, as its  yeah, I robbed the bank but my wife really needed a new car  is a traditional defense)? That drones are worse than torture though the laws of war distinguish between bullets/bombs but not torture of people under your complete control? And if a frightened, unprepared democracy overreacts initially by employing torture, what's Cheney's excuse years later?<br /> <br /> Two other details:<br /> <br /> Strange that Chris Matthews keeps invoking the fantastical Jack Bauer hypothetical. That's like creating a military budget around chance that Putin will explode a suicide vest while at a UN session. Isn't it better to discuss plans for 99.9999 percent likelihoods than amigdola-fueled fiction? Also, I like  wardrobe malfunction  as much as next guy. But don't euphemisms have some limits -- now  torture  becoming  enhanced interrogation  becoming, in Brennan's usage, only  EIT  (wait, isn't that a contraceptive device?). Will we allow word play to squelch debate?</em><br /> <br /> <strong>On Obama Economic Performance.</strong> We listen to a Fox News report on the December jobs report,  The economic news is better, really much better...  Jobs way up after 57 straight months of continuous growth, the stock market nearly tripled since 2009, energy prices are plummeting. <em>So why isn't the country's economic pessimism lifting and Obama getting some credit?</em> Chris Matthews (again) is irate about how a smart political communicator like Reagan would be selling it like hot cakes.<br /> <br /> Frum recalls how the W. White House in 2003-4 was very careful not to excessively boast since things can always go south quickly.  And every person is the world's leading expert on how they're doing so you can't convince them they're doing well if they don't agree. The labor participation rate, especially for men, is at an all-time low and the wealth of families is a fraction of what it was a decade ago. Things are better but... not good. <br /> <br /> Corn explains that the prevailing economic mood is some relief but a lot of uncertainty.

"Dear Mass Media: Allow the Truth to Breathe"	"I was a young teenager, but I recall the Los Angeles <a href= http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/18/us/los-angeles-riots-fast-facts/  target= _hplink >riots</a> that took place in response to the acquittal of the police officers responsible for beating Rodney King in 1992.<br /> <br /> His mistreatment, caught on a <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW1ZDIXiuS4  target= _hplink >VHS</a> tape, was a springboard for the marginalized community to exhale anger over nearly 500 years of unmitigated <a href= http://rt.com/usa/214079-chomsky-america-racist-society/  target= _hplink >racism</a> in this country.<br /> <br /> The furious people and fires raged on, causing $1 billion in damages and costing 55 people their lives. Years after the rebuilding took place and the LAPD was <a href= http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/05/21/bad-cops  target= _hplink >cleansed</a> of most of its blatant corruption, the pressure would continue to build up in persons of color.<br /> <br /> I did not understand it then, and even if I had, I would not have recognized what it truly meant. No, one needs an <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristen-howerton/white-privilege-doesnt-me_b_5296914.html  target= _hplink >education</a> for that, something that is very hard to attain as a <a href= http://www.racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=280:minor0101&catid=15&Itemid=118  target= _hplink >minority</a> of any kind.<br /> <br /> The words 'white <a href= http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/10/16/bill_oreilly_vs_jon_stewart_on_white_privilege.html  target= _hplink >privilege</a>' and 'civil rights' meant little to me as I sat watching the news coverage. Maybe that is because I was a part of an <a href= http://www.racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=280:minor0101&catid=15&Itemid=118  target= _hplink >underprivileged</a> minority and did not know it yet. It would take years of schooling and seeking out the truth to realize that the marginalization of black folks far surpasses that of most others in this country of the free.<br /> <br /> Perhaps it was because I had lived in an African American foster family or that my friends were every shade of the rainbow, but I did not feel racism growing up.  The truth is that the very institutions that America was founded upon were set up to put a foot on the necks of people of color. I too felt most of the pain that people of color did; I lived among them. However there was a fundamental difference in the experience I had growing up.<br /> <br /> It would not be until I was 26 and in college that I took courses that identified the biases and white privilege the country was founded upon. While it does not serve as an excuse for the criminal and social effects it has created in people of color, it serves as an undisputed explanation.<br /> <br /> Fast forward some 22 years later. Rodney King is dead, the Internet has come leaps and bounds, and citizen journalism comes in the form of videophones that have captured all kinds of civil rights violations. Report after report shows police forces issuing instant judgment much like the movie <em>Judge Dredd</em>. Their bullets become the judge, jury and death sentence. <a href= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ad%20hominem  target= _hplink >Ad homonym</a> attacks begin appearing all over the place on the victims of these crimes. Racist remarks are what some get in response to demanding those in power are held accountable, a reminder that we are most definitely not in a post-racial America.<br /> <br /> Some write off the senseless deaths as being the fault of the deceased. In other words, the slavemasters perceive danger and are supported by those who feel their reaction was <a href= http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/the-case-for-police-reforms-is-much-bigger-than-michael-brown/383210/  target= _hplink >justified</a>. Or maybe these black folk deserved what they had coming: if only they had listened to the officers and submitted, even if their rights were being abused.<br /> <br /> Fear grips <a href= http://www.wpr.org/new-effort-aims-ease-tensions-between-police-racial-minorities  target= _hplink >everyone</a>. Law enforcement feels justified and those who shamelessly possess privilege defend their stance, blaming the victims of these horrific crimes. Yes, they might have been punks in some instances, but they, like everyone else, deserve their day in court.<br /> <br /> Those who are the most enlightened among us realize that even  black on black  violence is a product of the hate that has been shown to this minority for such a long time. Pulling oneself up by our bootstraps is not often an option. These souls fill up a large percent of our <a href= http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1143193?uid=3739776&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21105454023553  target= _hplink >prisons</a>; they have historically lacked education and access to jobs. Their ancestors were made to help build this fine country, by force. It is convenient to forget all of this when we go on shaming and justifying the kind of judgment these humans have endured. Hearing others blame the plight of the black woman, man and child on themselves shows that indeed we are a society that is so shamelessly steeped in white privilege that the majority does not look in the mirror and feel humble that they possess the advantage.<br /> <br /> While the media should be focusing on academic and social approaches to these problems, they find it more interesting to cover the most sensational events when one person of color after another have their lives snuffed out by law enforcement officials who should be protecting them. We see two-minute sound bites of those who are showing their solidarity with these victims, from professional athletes to citizens of every major city in the United States.<br /> <br /> In the city of Greensboro, North Carolina, where I live, white privilege is alive and well. However, so is the spirit of the civil rights movement, a reminder of something we who travel through or work downtown know very well. For those involved in the social justice community, we always expect to see the usual suspects: those individuals who have made it their life work to tirelessly fight for the rights of the most underprivileged. Greensboro journalist Eric Ginsburg, an associate editor for <a href= http://triad-city-beat.com/  target= _hplink ><em>The Triad City Beat</em></a>, has covered many protests through his undergraduate writing career at Guilford College and later as a professional writer. These protests, Ginsburg says, are much different from what he's seen in the past.<br /> <br />  I have seen protests this size in Greensboro about police violence before. What's more notable, I think, is that element of civil disobedience. I think we can expect to see more of it in the coming week, too,  Ginsburg said via Facebook.<br /> <br /> Not many protests in the past have seen downtown roads <a href= http://myfox8.com/2014/12/03/protesters-organizing-in-greensboro-following-eric-garner-decision/  target= _hplink >blocked</a> off without a permit, and the events are attracting more young, fresh faces. The news events of the past few weeks have started a revival in the call for better civil rights and accountability.  <br /> <br /> Much like the <a href= http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/commentary/299/entry  target= _hplink >Woolworth</a> lunch counter that has been preserved by the International Civil Rights Museum, a relic of a time not that long ago that black folk were not allowed to sit with the white, <em>Triad City Beat</em> and other independent newspapers across the country are trying to preserve the rhyme and reason behind these organized events.  They provide the coverage needed to begin to build understanding.<br /> <br /> Ginsburg points out,  Well, I think we have a strong interest in helping people understand what is happening and why. We have a different understanding of what's important (such as journalism versus profit) than some outlets. <br /> <br /> Until other outlets begin to strike the <a href= http://triad-city-beat.com/greensboro-protesters-shut-down-streets-after-eric-garner-decision/  target= _hplink >balance</a> that Ginsburg's <a href= http://triad-city-beat.com/coming-to-a-misunderstanding-about-race-and-privilege/  target= _hplink >publication</a> has, the megaphone that is being used to spread the news of the recent protests may do more harm than good to the effected communities.  <br /> <br /> Whether or not the current movement has traction that will last throughout the winter, it is the media's responsibility to show the true faces and explain the real reasons behind what is taking place. <br /> <br /> Anything less is a crime.

"The COP20 Climate Talks Disaster Movie"	"<center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-COP20diein.jpglarge ><img alt= 2014-12-14-COP20diein.jpglarge  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-COP20diein-thumb.jpglarge  width= 570  height= 341  /></a></center><br /> <center><em>A die-in on the last official day of the COP20 climate talks</em></center><br /> <br /> It's late Saturday night in Lima, Peru and the COP20 United Nations climate talks are about to reconvene for another late-night, overtime session. The talks were supposed to wrap up on Friday afternoon -- coming into the talks, the Peruvian environment minister was so optimistic that he suggested the talks would close ahead of schedule. But as the talks have ground on for another day, the same historic divisions that have blocked progress have reemerged, with poorer countries and climate activists making impassioned pleas for action and rich countries urging  compromise.  <br /> <br /> Watching the final debates of COP20, I'm reminded of that scene in every disaster movie where the hero warns those in power that if they don't step outside of the usual protocol and take urgent action the catastrophic (e.g. meteor, monster, aliens) will take place. Those in power nod politely, say they take the concerns seriously, and then sigh as the hero is dragged out of the room kicking and screaming. <br /> <br /> Rich countries here at COP20 say they acknowledge the crisis -- but they don't act like it. They're still stuck in a business-as-usual approach to the problem. You can hear it in their rhetoric. Earlier today, the United States lead negotiator, Todd Stern, urged countries not to support a watered down text that contains almost-nothing in the way of concrete action. Don't let  the perfect be the enemy of the good,  he urged poorer nations who were still fighting for a stronger outcome. Failure to sign could,  undermine the entire process.  <br /> <br /> Of course, far more than the  process  is at stake. Scientists are practically shouting from the rooftops that we're approaching dangerous tipping points, after which catastrophic climate change will be unavoidable. Vulnerable communities, already reeling from the impacts of extreme weather and other climate impacts, are shouting for action -- and increasingly taking matters into their own hands: just a few weeks ago, a group of Pacific Warriors, whose homes are threatened by sea-level rise, took to traditional canoes and blocked a coal export facility in Australia. For them, and the millions more who are on the front lines of the climate crisis, this fight isn't about saving face or a few percentage points of GDP: it's about living or dying. It's about having a country or sinking into the ocean. <br /> <br /> One of the mottos of vulnerable countries here at the climate talks has been,  Survival is not negotiable.  And yet, with few other options, they are forced to negotiate. They are pressured, badgered, threatened, and then called unreasonable. They're worn down, divided, and then forced to compromise -- forced to accept the  good  instead of the necessary. The United Nations is a place of protocol and decorum, but listen to the speeches and pleas at the negotiations, and you can hear our heroes screaming for the world to wake up. They're trying everything they can to shake the powerful out of their stupor. <br /> <br /> In the disaster movie, the powerful usually leap into action at the very last second, just when the alien is at the door or the asteroid is bearing down on Washington. But with climate change, we can't wait for the floodwaters to reach the White House door while we watch millions drown. Ten years ago, people used to say that it would take a major climate disaster hitting the United States to push the country into action. But we've already watched Katrina sink New Orleans, Sandy wipe away parts of New York, drought devastate California, and fires incinerate huge swaths of the Southwest. Yet despite the impacts, climate deniers still rule Congress, and even our supposed champions dig, drill, and burn their way through more and more fossil fuels. They live on, safe in their bubbles, while the poor and the vulnerable bear the impacts of our collective inaction. <br /> <br /> How, then, to shake the powerful into action? How to shock them from business-as-usual and into crisis mode? This is where movements come in. If we can't force politicians to realize the future of the planet is at stake, maybe we can force them to realize that the future of their political careers is at stake. We can be the flood that shows up at their doorstep, the storm that rattles the windows, the drought that dries up votes and support for their corrupt policies. In the race against climate change, we must rise up faster then the seas, burn hotter than the fires, hit harder than the hurricanes.<br /> <br /> The good news is, we too are reaching tipping points. When the Peoples Climate March swept into New York and cities across the planet in September, we reached our own record levels: more than 400,000 in NYC, hundreds of thousands more around the world. Last Wednesday, 20,000 people flooded Lima in the largest climate march in Latin American history. Our calls for climate justice are rattling windows from Delhi to London to Washington. <br /> <br /> It may be too late. Perhaps the asteroid can't be turned around, the monster has grown to big to be defeated. But our movie still isn't over. And until the credits role, I'm holding out hope for our heroes. We may just pull this one out in the end. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 19:01:07 -0500"	"politics"
"Friends Say They Pushed UVA 'Jackie' To Call Cops"	"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Three friends of an alleged victim of a gang rape at a University of Virginia frat house told The Associated Press that a magazine article that used the woman's attack to paint a picture of a culture of sexual violence on college campuses was wrong on a number of key points: most important that they didn't encourage her to report the attack and that they were more concerned about their reputations than her well-being.<br /> <br /> One of the friends, a 20-year-old, third-year student referred to as  Randall  in the Rolling Stone article but whose real name is Ryan Duffin, told the AP that not only did he encourage the alleged victim to go to police, but he started to dial 9-1-1 on his cellphone until she begged off saying she just wanted to go back to her dorm and go to sleep.<br /> <br />  I couldn't help but notice that everything that the article said about me was incorrect,  Duffin said.<br /> <br /> The Rolling Stone article set off an intense debate about sexual violence, alcohol, fraternities, and journalism ethics.<br /> <br /> The Associated Press also spoke with the other two friends portrayed in the article: third-year, 20-year-old U.Va. students Kathryn Hendley and Alex Stock, known as  Cindy  and  Andy  in the article. None of the three friends was contacted by the Rolling Stone's reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, before the article was published; each of them rejected multiple assertions made in the article, which has since been retracted.<br /> <br /> All three say Erdely has since reached out to them, and Hendley told the AP Erdely apologized to her for portraying her the way she did.<br /> <br /> The three friends say they continue to work on correcting the record about what happened that night, and at least one, Duffin, wonders to what extent he believes the victim's own version of what happened — or whether any discrepancies in her story matter.<br /> <br />  People at U.Va. want answers just as much as I do,  Duffin says.  But if anything, the takeaway from all this is that I still don't really care if what's presented in this article is true or not because I think it's far more important that people focus on the issue of sexual assault as a whole. <br /> <br /> Other news media have also interviewed the friends but this is the first time each of them agreed to allow their full names to be used. A lawyer representing the victim, who has been identified only as  Jackie,  has declined several requests by the AP to interview Jackie and did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article; the AP does not typically name alleged victims of sexual assault.<br /> <br /> The Rolling Stone article, published last month, described a culture of sexual violence hiding in plain sight at U.Va. The article has roiled the campus and caused a huge backlash, with U.Va. suspending fraternity activities until January, the Board of Visitors appointing an independent investigator to look into the allegations and the university handing the case over to the Charlottesville police.<br /> <br /> The main focus of the piece is an alleged gang rape that Jackie said happened on Sept. 28, 2012, during her first semester on campus. In the article, she said she had gone out on a date with a classmate named  Drew,  who later that night lured her into a secluded room at a frat house. Once inside the room, she said, she was raped by a group of seven fraternity brothers while her date and one other man watched.<br /> <br /> As described in the Rolling Stone article, a distraught Jackie met her three friends at a picnic table in the shadows of the frat house and tearfully told them what had happened.<br /> <br /> While the article said Duffin suggested they take her to the hospital, it described Stock and Hendley as carrying on a debate about what would happen to her reputation and theirs should word get out.<br /> <br />  The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackie's rape, while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress, wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep, forgetful sleep,  the article said.  Detached, Jackie listened as Cindy prevailed over the group: 'She's gonna be the girl who cried rape, and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again.' <br /> <br /> However, Hendley told the AP that not only did she not say any of that, she had arrived with Stock to the picnic table only to have Jackie say she didn't want her to be part of the conversation. She said she watched from afar while Stock and Duffin talked with Jackie.<br /> <br /> Stock confirmed this account.<br /> <br /> As described by Duffin to the AP, this is what happened: He had returned home from a party when he got a call from Jackie. He left to meet her and she was sitting on the top of a picnic table outside U.Va.'s Tuttle-Dunnington dorm. She was shaking and  it looked like she had been crying,  Duffin said.  Her lip was quivering, her eyes were darting around. And right then, I put two and two together. I knew she had been on this date and people don't usually look like that after a date. <br /> <br /> Jackie eventually told Duffin her version of what she said had happened that night: that she was gang raped at a frat house.<br /> <br />  My first reaction was, 'We need to go to police,'  he said.  I wanted to go to police immediately. I was really forceful on that, actually. And I almost took it to calling (the police) right there.  He said he had his phone out, prepared to call 9-1-1,  but she didn't want to and,  he remembers thinking,  'I can't do that if she doesn't want to do it.' <br /> <br /> Stock corroborated this version of events.<br /> <br />  Jackie's response was, 'I don't want to,'  Stock said.  'I don't want to do that right now. I just want to go to bed.' <br /> <br /> Feeling hamstrung by Jackie's refusal to go to authorities, Duffin said that days later he sought advice from his dorm's resident assistant. Careful not to mention Jackie by name, so the RA wouldn't be obligated to contact police, he said he asked if he should call police even though Jackie didn't want him to. The RA told Duffin that he should encourage Jackie to talk with police, but that Duffin couldn't force her to do so.<br /> <br /> The RA, who asked not to be named, confirmed Duffin's story to the AP.

"Sony Demands News Outlets Stop Publishing Information From Leaked Documents"	"By Lisa Richwine<br /> <br /> LOS ANGELES, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Sony Pictures Entertainment told certain news organizations on Sunday to stop publishing information contained in documents stolen by hackers who attacked the movie studio's computer network last month, three media groups reported.<br /> <br /> The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter and Variety published stories reporting that they had each received a letter from David Boies, an attorney for Sony, demanding that the outlets stop reporting information contained in the documents and immediately destroy them.<br /> <br /> The studio  does not consent to your possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading or making any use  of the information, Boies wrote in the letter, according to the New York Times report.<br /> <br /> A Sony spokesman had no comment on the reports. Representatives for Variety and The Hollywood Reporter could not immediately be reached via email on Sunday.<br /> <br /> New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said:  Any decisions about whether or how to use any of the information will take into account both the significance of the news and the questions of how the information emerged and who has access to it. <br /> <br /> A spokesman for Boies confirmed he sent a letter to certain media outlets on behalf of Sony but declined to discuss details.<br /> <br /> Disclosures from the internal documents have caused turmoil at the studio, a unit of Japan's Sony Corp, and shed light on internal discussions key to the company's future. For instance, the unidentified hackers have released troves of documents that include employee salaries and financial information, marketing plans and contracts with business partners.<br /> <br /> In addition, the documents that have emerged included an exchange in which Co-Chairman Amy Pascal joked about President Barack Obama's race. After media outlets reported that, Pascal subsequently issued a public apology for  insensitive and inappropriate  emails.<br /> <br /> Pascal is scheduled to meet this week with civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, whose spokeswoman says he is weighing whether to call for her resignation. Pascal did not respond to a request for comment, and a Sony spokeswoman declined to comment on Pascal's future.<br /> <br /> Sony, in a memo to staff seen by Reuters on Dec. 2, acknowledged that a large amount of data was stolen by the hackers but has declined to confirm specific documents.<br /> <br /> Over the weekend, a message claiming to be from the Guardians of Peace, a group that says it carried out the cyber attack on Sony, warned of additional disclosures.<br /> <br />  We are preparing for you a Christmas gift,  said the message posted on a site for sharing files called Pastebin.  The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting.  (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Edmund Klamann) "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 00:00:31 -0500"	"technology"
"Joseph Scott Pemberton, U.S. Marine, Charged With Murder Of Transgender Woman In Philippines"	"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A Philippine government prosecutor says a detained U.S. Marine has been charged with murder in the killing of a Filipino transgender.<br /> <br /> Prosecutor Emily de los Santos said Monday there was  probable cause  that Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton killed Jennifer Laude, whose former name was Jeffrey, in a motel room, where  the victim's body was found in October in Olongapo city, northwest of Manila. She had apparently been drowned in a toilet bowl. The emotional case reignited a debate over custody of American military personnel accused of crimes. But the looming irritant between the treaty allies over Pemberton's custody was eased after Washington agreed to move him from a U.S. warship to a Philippine camp, where he remained under American custody with an outer ring of Filipino guards."

"Creativity Key to Peace Dividends in Myanmar"	"YANGON (IRIN) - As Myanmar's nationwide ceasefire negotiations continue, peace in many formerly war-torn regions has allowed state-run lifesaving services to gradually expand. But their provision is intensely politicized, and carefully crafted access strategies are vital, experts warn.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-15-download.jpeg ><img alt= 2014-12-15-download.jpeg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-15-download-thumb.jpeg  width= 490  height= 327  /></a><br /> <em>Steve Sandford/IRIN</em><br /> <br /> Protracted violence combined with what The Asia Foundation (TAF), an international development NGO focused on Asia, called the central government's  extreme deficit in legitimacy  in ethnic regions meant that social services were often designed and implemented directly or indirectly by ethnic groups engaged in hostilities with the Burmese army. <br /> <br /> However, service providers have begun to adjust by  <a href= http://www.christianaid.org.uk/Images/uniting-health-services-in-eastern-myanmar-october-2014%20.pdf  target= _hplink >converging</a>  programmes, or attempting to align and unify the main elements of government and ethnic health organizations' systems - service delivery, governance and leadership, workforce, and information systems - in an effort to increase impact while allowing the peace process to continue.  <br /> <br /> In 2011 President Thein Sein <a href= http://www.irinnews.org/in-depth/95199/96/what-next-for-myanmar  target= _hplink >instituted reforms</a>, stoking unprecedented encouragement from international donors; aid money jumped from US$355 million in 2010 to $504 million in 2012. But ceasefire negotiations with some opposition groups continue, and even peaceful ethnic regions remain mired in deep, complex poverty.  <br /> <br /> A UN Refugee Agency (<a href= http://data.unhcr.org/thailand/download.php?id=294  target= _hplink >UNHCR</a>) report pointed to Myanmar's  new aid paradigm  of  moving towards the approach seen elsewhere in the world, where donors work with the government and fund projects at local level .  <br /> <br /> Nyunt Naing Thein, deputy chief of party for the Project for Local Empowerment, a programme run by the International Rescue Committee in Thailand, told IRIN:  As humanitarians, we are providing crucial services in a politically tense environment, so we have to be very careful with sequencing our own changes so that we don't jump the service provision aspects ahead of the politics.   <br /> <br /> Myanmar's Ministry of Health <a href= http://www.moh.gov.mm/file/World%20Bank/WB/Community%20Engagement%20Planning%20Framework_English.pdf%20  target= _hplink >said</a> that while there is no single national convergence policy  progress has been made... at the local and state levels, for example with training and [the] provision of vaccines and commodities.   <br /> <br /> Experts say it is crucial that everyone from donors to practitioners see convergence as a matter of necessity, but carry out the process with patience. As services are scaled up and formalized in impoverished and isolated corners of the country, survival strategies developed during decades of violence and intimidation continue to be important. <br /> <br /> <strong>Creative strategies </strong><br /> <br /> Healthcare workers have been targeted by the government or army in some locations.  Community health organizations have filled the service gap left by the state, but work has often proved dangerous... The direct targeting of healthcare workers has included kidnappings by the Tatmadaw [Myanmar army], while government restrictions on movement prevented patients and healthcare workers accessing clinics. Individuals who contravened restrictions risked being shot on site by Tatmadaw forces,  said <a href= http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/5258/Footer/Katherine  target= _hplink >Katherine Footer</a>, a research associate at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health in a November 2014 article on violence against healthcare workers in eastern Myanmar.   <br /> <br />  Community health workers have filled the service gap left by the state, but work has proved dangerous   Footer argued that healthcare workers' experiences in tense areas led to the development of important survival tactics:  In the presence of chronic insecurity, development of self-protection strategies by [healthcare workers] and the communities they serve has been essential to maintaining a shadow healthcare system in eastern Burma and ameliorating, if not eliminating, restrictions to access.  <br /> <br /> Myanmar researcher Ashley South argued in a 2010 Chatham House <a href= http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/field/field_document/Executive%20Summary%20Conflict%20and%20Survival%20Self%20Protection%20in%20South-East%20Burma.pdf  target= _hplink >paper </a>that  such local approaches to protection are particularly important in situations where international humanitarian actors have limited access - and especially in cases where the state is one of the main agents threatening vulnerable populations.   <br /> <br /> International agencies supported many such efforts by setting up offices across the border in Thailand which, according to a 2012 article published by the Overseas Development Institute's Humanitarian Practice Network (HPN), forged relationships between aid agencies and opposition organizations. <br /> <br />  As cross-border aid is often the only way to help highly vulnerable communities, agencies working in zones of ongoing armed conflict have little choice but to accept some form of relationship with insurgent groups,  the <a href= http://www.odihpn.org/hpn-resources/network-papers/local-to-global-protection-in-myanmar-burma-sudan-south-sudan-and-zimbabwe  target= _hplink >HPN paper</a> explained, arguing that international agencies should do more to understand local protection strategies these workers used.  <br /> <br />  This will not be a straightforward undertaking in south-east Myanmar, where the humanitarian agenda is highly politicized,  HPN researchers argued, however insisting that  local humanitarian activities can mobilise communities and help to build trust and capacity, and international donors can engage positively with such initiatives.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Vaccinations, for example </strong><br /> <br />  We have to strike a balance,  says Nyunt Naing Thein, pointing to vaccinations as an example of a crucial service that can be expanded through proper convergence. <br /> <br />  Sending government healthcare workers [to administer vaccines] won't make sense because they won't be accepted there by the communities or the ethnic armed groups that still control some territories,  he explained.  Sending ethnic health workers makes more sense, but they are not certified by the central authority or Ministry of Health,  he said, calling it  a situation where we want to get services like vaccinations expanded to people who need them, and we also want to respect the central government's requirements to train and certify people who can administer vaccines.  <br /> <br /> To solve this problem, the Project for Local Empowerment developed an accreditation partnership between a Burmese university and a Thai university. <br /> <br />  The ethnic health workers were much more comfortable accessing the training [in Thailand],  Nyunt Naing Thein told IRIN.  And the fact that the government agreed to do this, signals some respect for the work these people have been doing as humanitarians for decades, and a willingness to engage in supporting people everywhere in the country.  <br /> <br /> Nyunt Naing Thein emphasized that all such processes should be carried out in a way that builds trust among the parties concerned. <br /> <br /> Kim Jolliffe, a researcher who authored the TAF report, warned:  In areas where trust is slowly being built but ceasefires remain fragile, rapid expansion of government presence can damage confidence and must be done with caution and better consultation.  <br /> <br /> Jolliffe told IRIN that social services and peace processes are interdependent:  Convergence of state and ethnic armed organization-linked systems should not be viewed as a strategy that can be pushed through, as it is dependent on the peace transition and will take time.  <br /> <br /> He explained that convergence efforts could have long-term impacts on how government-run social services are shaped and reformed in conflict-affected areas, adding that:  It is crucial that support is maintained to existing structures on which hundreds of thousands people depend, particularly as ceasefires could break.  <br /> <br /> Myanmar was ruled from 1962 to 2011 by a repressive military government that crushed dissent and fought protracted armed conflicts in the country's border regions where ethnic minorities live. Social services in remote and contested areas were provided by everything from local NGOs linked to ethnic opposition groups to cross-border mobile teams - some of whom were known as  <a href= http://www.backpackteam.org/  target= _hplink >Back Pack Medics</a>.  <br /> <br /> This report was originally published by <a href= http://www.irinnews.org/report/100857/creativity-key-to-peace-dividends-in-myanmar  target= _hplink >IRIN Humanitarian News</a>.

"Hostages Held Inside Australian Cafe, Flag Similar To Islamic State's Seen In Window"	"(Reuters) - Australian police locked down the center of the country's biggest city on Monday after an armed assailant walked into a downtown Sydney cafe, took hostages and forced them to display an Islamic flag, igniting fears of a jihadist attack.<br /> <br /> Police said they knew of one armed assailant involved in the incident at the Lindt chocolate cafe in the heart of Sydney's financial district, but there could be more.<br /> <br /> Police, including heavily armed paramilitary officers, cordoned off several blocks around the cafe as negotiators tried to defuse one of the biggest security scares in Australia for decades. Snipers and a SWAT team could be seen taking up positions around the cafe and police helicopters flew overhead.<br /> <br />  <br /> At least five hostages have escaped since the mid-morning siege began. It was not clear how many more hostages remained in the cafe but it was not as high as the 30-40 that had been reported earlier, police said.<br /> <br /> Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who has warned of militant plans to strike Australian targets, said there were indications the hostage situation at the cafe was politically motivated.<br /> <br />  This is a very disturbing incident. I can understand the concerns and anxieties of the Australian people,  Abbott told reporters in Canberra, without providing any information on the siege.<br /> <br /> Australia, a staunch ally of the United States and its escalating action against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, is on high alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East.<br /> <br />  We have moved to a footing that would be consistent with a terrorist event,  Andrew Scipione, police commissioner for the state of New South Wales, told reporters in Sydney.<br /> <br /> The cafe was directly opposite a commercial television studio and footage earlier showed several people inside the cafe standing with their hands pressed against the windows.<br /> <br /> Pictures showed a black and white flag similar to those used by Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria being held up by what appeared to be a staff member and another woman. Local media reports said the flag was the Shahada, a general expression of faith in Islam, a translation of which is:  There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. <br /> <br /> The incident forced the evacuation of nearby buildings in Sydney's central business district and sent shockwaves around a country where many people have started to turn their attention to the approaching Christmas festive season following earlier security scares.<br /> <br /> In September, Australian anti-terrorism police said they had thwarted an imminent threat to behead a random member of the public and days later, a teenager in Melbourne was shot dead after attacking two anti-terrorism officers with a knife.<br /> <br /> EVACUATING BY LADDER<br /> <br /> Dozens of heavily armed police surrounded the cafe in Martin Place after the siege began around 9:45 a.m. local time. The area is home to the Reserve Bank of Australia, commercial banks and close to the New South Wales state parliament.<br /> <br />  I walked up to the door and then everyone was sitting down and the door's locked which is pretty weird because it's never locked and there was one guy walking around with a hat and a beard,  a man who identified himself as Bruno, a worker at the cafe, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp, referring to the suspected assailant. He said he then turned away.<br /> <br /> Several hours into the siege, police led about two dozen people out of a building opposite the cafe and through the cordon. Others were evacuated from the building above the cafe by ladder, television pictures showed.<br /> <br /> Earlier, Lindt Australia Chief Executive Steve Loane told Sky Business there were about 10 staff working at the cafe and  probably 30 customers  although he said that figure was an estimate.<br /> <br /> The Reserve Bank of Australia said staff had been locked down inside the building, and were all safe and accounted for.<br /> <br /> The nearby U.S. consulate was also evacuated, according to an embassy spokeswoman, along with the Sydney Opera House. Tourists were being let back into the world-famous venue by early afternoon.<br /> <br /> BANKS AND SHOPS CLOSE<br /> <br /> Major banks closed their offices in the central business district and people were told to avoid the area. Shops in a four block radius were shut, leaving large parts of the CBD all but deserted by mid-afternoon.<br /> <br /> Traders in currency markets said the hostage news may have contributed to a dip in the Australian dollar, which was already under pressure from global risk aversion as oil prices fell anew.<br /> <br /> Ray Hadley, a popular radio jockey, said he had been contacted by a hostage and could hear the suspected gunman issuing orders in the background. Police declined to comment on Hadley's claim.<br /> <br /> Concerns about an attack in Australia by radical Islamists have been growing for more than a year, with the security agency raising its national terrorism public alert to  high  in September.<br /> <br /> That month, a spokesman for the Islamic State urged supporters in Western nations, including Australia, to attack civilians or military personnel at home.<br /> <br /> (Writing by Lincoln Feast; Additional reporting Swati Pandey, Colin Packham, Wayne Cole and Jason Reed; Editing by Paul Tait and Raju Gopalakrishnan)<br /> <br /> <br /> <blockquote class= twitter-tweet  lang= en ><p>Here's a vine showing the dramatic moment three hostages escaped the <a href= https://twitter.com/hashtag/sydneysiege?src=hash >#sydneysiege</a> <a href= https://t.co/7VWb7IW5hm >https://t.co/7VWb7IW5hm</a></p>— BuzzFeed Australia (@BuzzFeedOz) <a href= https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedOz/status/544361266718846977 >December 15, 2014</a></blockquote><br /> <script async src= //platform.twitter.com/widgets.js  charset= utf-8 ></script> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 19:12:08 -0500"	"world"
"The COP20 Climate Talks Disaster Movie"	"<center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-COP20diein.jpglarge ><img alt= 2014-12-14-COP20diein.jpglarge  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-COP20diein-thumb.jpglarge  width= 570  height= 341  /></a></center><br /> <center><em>A die-in on the last official day of the COP20 climate talks</em></center><br /> <br /> It's late Saturday night in Lima, Peru and the COP20 United Nations climate talks are about to reconvene for another late-night, overtime session. The talks were supposed to wrap up on Friday afternoon -- coming into the talks, the Peruvian environment minister was so optimistic that he suggested the talks would close ahead of schedule. But as the talks have ground on for another day, the same historic divisions that have blocked progress have reemerged, with poorer countries and climate activists making impassioned pleas for action and rich countries urging  compromise.  <br /> <br /> Watching the final debates of COP20, I'm reminded of that scene in every disaster movie where the hero warns those in power that if they don't step outside of the usual protocol and take urgent action the catastrophic (e.g. meteor, monster, aliens) will take place. Those in power nod politely, say they take the concerns seriously, and then sigh as the hero is dragged out of the room kicking and screaming. <br /> <br /> Rich countries here at COP20 say they acknowledge the crisis -- but they don't act like it. They're still stuck in a business-as-usual approach to the problem. You can hear it in their rhetoric. Earlier today, the United States lead negotiator, Todd Stern, urged countries not to support a watered down text that contains almost-nothing in the way of concrete action. Don't let  the perfect be the enemy of the good,  he urged poorer nations who were still fighting for a stronger outcome. Failure to sign could,  undermine the entire process.  <br /> <br /> Of course, far more than the  process  is at stake. Scientists are practically shouting from the rooftops that we're approaching dangerous tipping points, after which catastrophic climate change will be unavoidable. Vulnerable communities, already reeling from the impacts of extreme weather and other climate impacts, are shouting for action -- and increasingly taking matters into their own hands: just a few weeks ago, a group of Pacific Warriors, whose homes are threatened by sea-level rise, took to traditional canoes and blocked a coal export facility in Australia. For them, and the millions more who are on the front lines of the climate crisis, this fight isn't about saving face or a few percentage points of GDP: it's about living or dying. It's about having a country or sinking into the ocean. <br /> <br /> One of the mottos of vulnerable countries here at the climate talks has been,  Survival is not negotiable.  And yet, with few other options, they are forced to negotiate. They are pressured, badgered, threatened, and then called unreasonable. They're worn down, divided, and then forced to compromise -- forced to accept the  good  instead of the necessary. The United Nations is a place of protocol and decorum, but listen to the speeches and pleas at the negotiations, and you can hear our heroes screaming for the world to wake up. They're trying everything they can to shake the powerful out of their stupor. <br /> <br /> In the disaster movie, the powerful usually leap into action at the very last second, just when the alien is at the door or the asteroid is bearing down on Washington. But with climate change, we can't wait for the floodwaters to reach the White House door while we watch millions drown. Ten years ago, people used to say that it would take a major climate disaster hitting the United States to push the country into action. But we've already watched Katrina sink New Orleans, Sandy wipe away parts of New York, drought devastate California, and fires incinerate huge swaths of the Southwest. Yet despite the impacts, climate deniers still rule Congress, and even our supposed champions dig, drill, and burn their way through more and more fossil fuels. They live on, safe in their bubbles, while the poor and the vulnerable bear the impacts of our collective inaction. <br /> <br /> How, then, to shake the powerful into action? How to shock them from business-as-usual and into crisis mode? This is where movements come in. If we can't force politicians to realize the future of the planet is at stake, maybe we can force them to realize that the future of their political careers is at stake. We can be the flood that shows up at their doorstep, the storm that rattles the windows, the drought that dries up votes and support for their corrupt policies. In the race against climate change, we must rise up faster then the seas, burn hotter than the fires, hit harder than the hurricanes.<br /> <br /> The good news is, we too are reaching tipping points. When the Peoples Climate March swept into New York and cities across the planet in September, we reached our own record levels: more than 400,000 in NYC, hundreds of thousands more around the world. Last Wednesday, 20,000 people flooded Lima in the largest climate march in Latin American history. Our calls for climate justice are rattling windows from Delhi to London to Washington. <br /> <br /> It may be too late. Perhaps the asteroid can't be turned around, the monster has grown to big to be defeated. But our movie still isn't over. And until the credits role, I'm holding out hope for our heroes. We may just pull this one out in the end. "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 19:01:07 -0500"	"world"

On the<a href= http://www.hebcal.com/converter/  target= _hplink > Hebrew calendar,</a> the dates are 25 Kislev to 2 Tevet in the year 5775.<br /> <br /> An eight-day celebration, Hanukkah commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in the second century B.C.E. during the Maccabean revolt against oppressive Greek rulers. Jews celebrate the holiday by lighting a nine-branch candelabrum, commonly called a menorah. (Technically,<a href= http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Hanukkah/At_Home/Candlelighting/Hanukkiah.shtml  target= _hplink > the candelabrum for Hanukkah is called a <em>hanukkiah</em></a> to distinguish itself from the seven-branch menorah used in the Temple and described in <a href= http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0225.htm  target= _hplink >Exodus 25</a>.)<br /> <br /> The <a href= http://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/102978/jewish/The-Story-of-Chanukah.htm  target= _hplink >story of Hanukkah</a> is one of revolution and miracles: Greek influence over the Jews in the Land of Israel had become an affront to Jewish culture and ritual. Antiochus, the Greek ruler, forbade Jewish religious practice, so a small group of Jews, the <a href= http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Maccabees.html  target= _hplink >Maccabees</a>, revolted. These Jews eventually prevailed and, as a first order of business, restored the Holy Temple, which had been desecrated. The menorah in the Temple needed to be re-lit because, according to tradition, it should burn continuously. The Temple liberators found one vial of olive oil, enough for one day of light. Miraculously, the oil lasted for eight days.<br /> <br /> Today, Jews everywhere <a href= http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/1701725/jewish/Do-It-Yourself-Chanukah.htm  target= _hplink >light menorahs on each night of Hanukkah</a>. Traditionally, one candle or flame is lit for each night until the eighth night, when all eight lights shine together. The menorah has a ninth  helper  flame -- known as the <em>shamash</em> -- used to light the other candles. This is necessary because in Jewish law the Hanukkah lights' only purpose is to visually proclaim the miracle of the holiday. Jews place the lit menorah in a prominent window in order to fulfill this commandment.<br /> <br /> Gift giving is now a common practice on Hanukkah, and it is therefore a beloved time for many Jewish children.

"Hamas Stages Military Rally To Mark Anniversary"	"GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Islamic militant group Hamas displayed rockets and other heavy weapons Sunday during a rally marking the 27th anniversary of its founding.<br /> <br /> It also launched a drone that prompted Israel to scramble fighter jets in a precautionary measure, the Israeli military said. Several thousand people attended the show of force in Gaza City, a lower turnout than in previous Hamas anniversary rallies.<br /> <br /> The group's leaders watched from a stage, including former Gaza Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, who brandished an assault rifle and flashed a V-for-victory sign.<br /> <br /> Sunday's march came three-and-a-half months after the end of a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. It was the third and bloodiest round of fighting between the two since late 2008, with some 2,200 people killed on the Palestinian side and 72 on the Israeli side.<br /> <br /> Despite claims of victory by both Israel and Hamas, the fighting failed to resolve underlying conflicts that contributed to the summer war.<br /> <br /> Israel says it launched the operation in response to nonstop Hamas rocket fire. Hamas said it was fighting to lift an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade first imposed on Gaza after the Islamic militant group violently seized the territory from forces loyal to the Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007.<br /> <br /> With Sunday's weapons display, Hamas appeared to be sending a message to both Israel and the residents of Gaza that another round of fighting is an option.<br /> <br /> Hamas also released a video with brief narration purported to be from Mohammed Deif, the shadowy leader of the group's military wing and the target of repeated Israeli assassination attempts.<br /> <br /> Israel tried to kill Deif in an August airstrike on a Gaza City home that killed one of his wives and two of the couple's young children. Deif's fate has remained unclear, though Hamas said at the time that he had survived.<br /> <br /> The man in the recording identified as Deif said,  We will return to them (Israelis) with fighters that they cannot fight and will drive them out ...

"Merriam-Webster Names 'Culture' The 2014 Word Of The Year"	"<p>NEW YORK (AP) — A nation, a workplace, an ethnicity, a passion, an outsized personality. The people who comprise these things, who fawn or rail against them, are behind Merriam-Webster's 2014 word of the year: culture.</p><br />               <p>The word joins Oxford Dictionaries'  vape,  a darling of the e-cigarette movement, and  exposure,  declared the year's winner at Dictionary.com during a time of tragedy and fear due to Ebola.</p><br />               <p>Merriam-Webster based its pick and nine runners-up on significant increases in lookups this year over last on Merriam-Webster.com, along with interesting, often culture-driven — if you will — spikes of concentrated interest.</p><br />               <p>In the No. 2 spot is  nostalgia,  during a year of big 50th anniversaries pegged to 1964: the start of the free speech movement, the passage of the Civil Rights Act, the birth of the Ford Mustang and the British Invasion heralded by the landing of the Beatles on U.S. soil for the first time.</p><br />               <p>Nostalgia was followed by insidious, legacy, feminism and a rare multiword phrase that can be looked up in total, in a foreign language at that: the French  je ne sais quoi. </p><br />               <p>The Springfield, Massachusetts-based dictionary giant filters out perennial favorites when picking word of the year, but does that formula leave them chasing language fads?</p><br />               <p> We're simply using the word culture more frequently,  said Peter Sokolowski, editor at large for Merriam-Webster.  It may be a fad. It may not. It may simply be evolution. </p><br />               <p>Sokolowski noted that the reasons words are looked up aren't just about not knowing what they mean. Sometimes, he said, we seek inspiration or a way to check in on ourselves. Of an estimated 100 million lookups on the website each year and a similar number on the company's app, culture enjoyed a 15 percent year-over-year increase.</p><br />               <p>Percentage-wise, it doesn't sound like much, but the raw number in that stratosphere is large, Sokolowski said. He wouldn't disclose actual numbers, though, citing the proprietary nature of that data for a company still privately held.</p><br />               <p>Sokolowski is a lexicographer, not a mind reader, so his observations about why any single word takes off in terms of lookups is well-informed but theoretical.</p><br />               <p> The word culture's got a cultural story. We have noticed for years that culture has a cyclical spike every year at around Labor Day. That is to say back to school time during the month of September, so we've been watching this word spike at that time for years,  he said by telephone from Springfield.  In recent years we've seen similar spikes at the end of semesters during finals. </p><br />               <p>But traffic throughout the year indicates that culture is a  chameleon,  Sokolowski said.  When you put it next to another word it means something very different. For example, 'consumer culture' or 'rape culture,' which we've been reading about lately. </p><br />               <p>There's the  culture of transparency  in government and business, and  celebrity culture,  and the  culture of winning  in sports, he noted.  It's a word that can be very specific, like 'test prep culture,' or it can be very, very broad, like 'coffee culture.' </p><br />               <p>One standout reference that caught Sokolowski's eye in The New Yorker's December issue is from a new book,  How Google Works,  which includes a description of a software fix by a few engineers that made ads more relevant on the search engine:</p><br />               <p> It wasn't Google's culture that turned those five engineers into problem-solving ninjas who changed the course of the company over the weekend,  wrote the authors, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and former head of product development Jonathan Rosenberg.</p><br />               <p> Rather it was the culture that attracted the ninjas to the company in the first place. </p><br />               <p>Before the word culture exploded, Sokolowski said,  we used to talk about 'society' a lot. Certain groups are taking 'society' out of their names now. It seems to be receding. Part of that seems to be because it's elitist. We're using the word culture more frequently in that place. </p><br />               <p>Not all lookup spikes are quite that complex. The reason  je ne sais quoi  landed at No. 6, for instance, is  dead simple,  he said.</p><br />               <p>The fast-food drive-in chain Sonic, known for TV spots featuring two goofy dudes eating in a car, had them munching on boneless chicken wings in September.</p><br />               <p> I've finally found myself a wingman,  goofy guy No. 1 says of the wings he hopes will make him a chick magnet.</p><br />               <p> Oh right,  sneers goofy guy No. 2,  gonna give you that certain je ne sais quoi. </p><br />               <p>Responds No. 1:  Jenna said what? </p><br />               <p>They mine the word play a couple more times, but you get the picture.</p><br />               <p> Since September when this ad came out this word has been close to the Top 10 or in the Top 10 of our lookups almost every single day,  Sokolowski said.</p><br />               <p>Fast-food aside, he called this year's list a relatively sober one.</p><br />               <p>Insidious, for example, received a bump early in the year when a new trailer was released for  Insidious: Chapter 3,  a prequel in the horror film franchise  Insidious,  out in June. The word surfaced in a big way again, on Oct. 8, when a Texas hospital released a statement on the death of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first confirmed Ebola patient in the United States.</p><br />               <p>The statement spoke of his courageous battle and the hospital's profound sadness when he  succumbed to an insidious disease, Ebola. </p><br />               <p>Rounding out the Top 10 are innovation, surreptitious, autonomy and morbidity.</p><br />               <p> This is a fairly sober list. It was a fairly sober year,  he concluded.</p><br />               <p>___</p><br />               <p>Follow Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie</p> "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 03:25:32 -0500"	"arts"
"The 'Father Of Modern Baseball Cards' Has Died"	"Even most non-sports fans know what a baseball card looks like. There's a color photo on the front, along with a player's name, team and position. Many have a copy of the player's autograph as well as the team logo. On the back is printed the player's stats along with his height, weight and maybe a fact or two. <br /> <br /> It's been that way since 1952, when a Topps salesman named Seymour P. “Sy” Berger redesigned baseball cards for his company, coming up with the new format at his kitchen table in Brooklyn with artist Woody Gelman. <br /> <br />  We wanted to make something attractive that would catch the eye,  Berger told The Associated Press in 2002.  <a href= http://www.chron.com/news/article/Sy-Berger-father-of-modern-baseball-card-dies-5956752.php  target= _hplink >And we gave you six cards and a slice of gum for a nickel</a>. <br /> <br /> Berger died of natural causes on Sunday at his Long Island home at the age of 91, more than 60 years after reinventing what would become almost as much of an American pastime as the sport itself. <br /> <br />  <a href= http://www.newsday.com/long-island/obituaries/sy-berger-dead-creator-of-modern-day-baseball-card-was-91-1.9714097  target= _hplink >Before the days of ESPN and social media, everybody's connection to the players were through the cards</a>,  Marty Appel, former spokesman for the New York Yankees and Topps and a close family friend, told Newsday.  It seemed like every kid in America that liked baseball saved the cards, played with them. What he did at his kitchen table became an important American cultural icon. <br /> <br /> The 1952 Topps cards were produced in two sets, the second of which proved so unpopular at the time that Berger couldn't give them away.<br /> <br />  Around 1959 or so, I went around to carnivals and offered them for a penny a piece, <a href= http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/12027167/sy-berger-father-modern-day-baseball-cards-dies-age-91  target= _hplink >and it got so bad I offered them at 10 for a penny</a>,  Berger told Sports Collectors Digest, as quoted by ESPN.  They would say, 'We don't want them.' <br /> <br /> Years later, with the cards taking up storage space, <a href= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1674457-thousands-of-mickey-mantles-first-topps-cards-were-dumped-into-ocean  target= _hplink >Berger had hundreds of cases dumped at sea</a>, as Bleacher Report retells it. <br /> <br /> Today, the Mickey Mantle card in that set routinely sells for six figures, <a href= http://www.psacard.com/Articles/ArticleView/3093/1952-topps-mickey-mantle-brings-275-000  target= _hplink >including one that fetched $275,000 in a 2001 auction</a>. <br /> <br /> But Berger's career was about more than just the cards. He also forged friendships with the players as he signed them to contracts for Topps -- including what would become a lifelong bond with Hall of Famer Willie Mays. <br /> <br />  What can I say about Sy Berger? He was my longtime friend. He helped me from my first days in the majors. I never could have made it without him,  Mays told Newsday.  He always knew the right thing to say or the right thing to do. We worked together. We laughed together. We grew up together. <br /> <br /> Along with ballplayers, Berger also signed a contract with Brian Epstein, then manager of the Beatles, for Topps to produce cards of the Fab Four in 1964 and 1965.  <br /> <br /> “<a href= http://tbo.com/sports/blogs/sports-bookie/bergers-creativity-hustle-defined-topps-success-20141214/  target= _hplink >He flew to London where Brian Epstein had set up a licensing office, and he greeted Epstein in Yiddish</a>. Then, he made a deal,  Appel told Tampa Bay Online. “Those Beatles cards are valuable today, too.”<br /> <br /> Berger retired from Topps in 1997 but remained with the company as a consultant until 2002, Newsday reports. He is survived by his wife of nearly 70 years, three children, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 04:58:18 -0500"	"sports"

"J.K. Rowling Posts New Stories About Potions And Cauldrons On Pottermore"	"J.K. Rowling posted a new riddle on Pottermore yesterday, the next in a promised series of 12 pre-Christmas clues that, when unlocked, will lead to new material including writing about the world of Harry Potter.<br /> <br /> <strong>Here’s the quiz:</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt= potionsriddle  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2392722/thumbs/o-POTIONSRIDDLE-570.jpg?5  /><br /> <br /> Those who answer correctly unlock a scene in Harry’s sixth year Potions class, where new writing on potions and cauldrons can be uncovered. <br /> <br /> In the newly released backstory, Rowling reveals that Harry’s nemesis Professor Snape’s position as Potions master was chosen due to a rather prosaic motivation -- her own dislike for Chemistry, the subject she believed was most closely approximated at Hogwarts by Potions. Nonetheless, she admits, she grew to be fascinated by the subject and loved researching potion ingredients for the books. She also fills us in on whether Muggles can make potions. (Sorry, <strike>they</strike> we can’t.)<br /> <br /> Rowling also digs into the history of cauldrons, explaining that cauldrons remain essential tools for witches and wizards due to the need for an open flame for potion-making. Helga Hufflepuff’s hallow was almost a cauldron, reveals Rowling, but she ultimately decided that all the Horcruxes needed to be small enough for easy carrying. “There was something slightly comical and incongruous about having such a large and heavy Horcrux,” she writes. Horcruxes, of course, should be anything but comical.<br /> <br /> Earlier in this series of pre-Christmas reveals, Rowling posted new pieces about <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/12/jk-rowling-story-pottermore-1_n_6315646.html?utm_hp_ref=books  target= _hplink >Cokeworth, Lily Potter and Severus Snape’s hometown</a>, and about <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/13/jk-rowling-pottermore-story_n_6320142.html?utm_hp_ref=books  target= _hplink >the Leaky Cauldron and Florean Fortescue</a>. <br /> <br /> This isn’t the first time Rowling has weighed in on her process and the backgrounds of her globally beloved characters, of course. Check out earlier writings on <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/08/harry-potter-new-story-jk-rowling_n_5566633.html  target= _hplink >tabloid reporter Rita Skeeter</a> and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/31/jk-rowling-releases-dolores-umbridge-story_n_6082204.html  target= _hplink >dictatorial Dolores Umbridge</a> as well.<br /> <br /> Today brought another riddle from Rowling, this one set to reveal a new Moment from <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em>.<br /> <br /> <strong>Here's the clue:</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt= opalnecklace  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2392738/thumbs/o-OPALNECKLACE-570.jpg?5  /><br /> <br /> Solving this riddle will unlock the scene in which Harry's Quidditch teammate Katie Bell encounters a cursed necklace.

"Black Ties, Boleyns and News Boys: Three Shows in Four Days"	"The challenge was simple: Three wildly different shows in four days. My 68-year-old mother joined me and provided her input. Here's the recap: <br /> <br /> <strong>Living the History -- 125 Years of the Auditorium Theatre</strong><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-125.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-125.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-125-thumb.jpg  width= 500  height= 375  /></a><br /> <br /> Chicago's historic landmark performance venue, the Auditorium Theatre, received a classy and compact 125th birthday celebration on Dec. 9. Following an introduction by emcee John Mahoney, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel offered a few words on the importance of the venue in delivering world-class art to the city. And then, performers representing the wide range of the Auditorium's programming entertained the mostly black-tie and befurred audience. <br /> <br /> Highlights included performances by Chicago Symphony Orchestra's brass ensemble, performances by dancers from Alvin Ailey and Joffrey Ballet, and the star of the night, Broadway powerhouse Patti LuPone, whose grand grand-aunt, soprano Adelina Patti, performed at the venue when it opened in 1889. The only misstep in this glorious evening was the inclusion of a random rock band to represent the various rock concerts the venue has hosted since the '60s. <br /> <br /> But all was forgiven when, during the finale, the legendary theatre's side panels flanking the proscenium flew up into the rafters revealing the backstage, stage hands and technical crew. It took my breath away. A very fitting tribute to an army of people who make the art: it's more than just the performers on the stage -- it's the team behind the curtain who make it happen.  <br /> <br /> Mom rating:  Beautiful evening and amazing acoustics, but that rock band was loud. <br /> <br /> <strong><a href= http://www.lyricopera.org/bolena/  target= _blank ><em>Anna Bolena</em>; Lyric Opera</a></strong> <br /> Now through January 16<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-anna.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-14-anna.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-anna-thumb.jpg  width= 500  height= 333  /></a><br /> <em>Sondra Radvanovsky in Lyric Opera's  Anna Bolena </em><br /> <br /> Ok, so I'm not an opera buff. But every now and then I challenge myself to dust off my suit and spend a few hours getting my fancy culture on. And <em>Anna Bolena</em>, the final in the Tudor Queen trilogy by 19th century Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti, seemed like as good a reason as any to visit Chicago's Lyric Opera, given Queen Anne Boleyn, who was married to King Henry VIII only to be beheaded after she failed to bear him a successor, is somehow vaguely related to our family -- the Bullens. Also, I'd heard good things about the lead, American Soprano Sondra Radvanovsky.<br /> <br /> The good news is Radvanovsky simply blazes as the doomed Queen. With a voice reminiscent of Maria Callas, the regal Radvanovsky mines all she can from this thinly plotted and overly bloated opera (stick around for her heartbreaking mad scene late in the second act). The rest of the cast delivers Donizetti's score with courage and skill, but the material is about as flimsy as the production design, which features essentially one costume for both Anne and her confidant-cum-conspirator Jane Seymour (the impressive Jamie Barton) and a ceiling that occasionally reveals a few interesting backdrops. Indeed, it seems the budget cuts suffered by the Lyric have extended into the Royal Court. <br /> <br /> Mom rating:  Nice to hear a full orchestra but they oversimplified the history.

Everything you want in a family musical comedy is here: great tunes (by Alan Menken) that follow you as you hum your way home, a talented cast, an engaging storyline featuring a hero, a villain and a love story, and the dancing. The dancing! This athletic cast certainly has their work cut out for them, effortlessly executing Christopher Gattelli's rough-and-tumble choreography that ranges from deftly staged fist fights to split kicks to gymnastic tumbles to tap. <br /> <br /> In the Bale role, Dan DeLuca finds the right balance between the charismatic leader who initiates the strike and the forlorn young man who'd rather run away from his problems than deal with them head-on. As the smart young reporter who breaks the Newsie strike story while capturing the heart of the new-found union's leader, the spirited Stephanie Styles wins us over with her delightful first act number. <br /> <br /> Based on the opening night audience's enthusiastic ovation, this certainly will become a hot ticket this holiday season.<br /> <br /> Mom rating:  Those boys certainly can dance! It makes my knees hurt just thinking about it. Also: $9 for a glass of wine?  "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 10:26:25 -0500"	"arts"
"Jon Hamm Is Not Interested In Playing A Superhero"	"According to a recent interview with the <a href= http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-12/mad-mens-jon-hamm-i-am-old-and-irrelevant  target= _hplink >Radio Times</a>, Jon Hamm has  been in contention for quite a few  superhero parts in Hollywood blockbusters, but feels confident about his decision to stay out of the arena. <br /> <br />  For me to sign on now to do a superhero movie would mean I would be working until I am 50 as that particular superhero,  Hamm said, noting that the contracts actors often sign to star in superhero films are  Draconian.   It's a lot of work at one thing which is not necessarily the reason I got into the business which is to do many things. If you want to spend all day pressing the same key that ... seems an odd choice. <br /> <br /> Back in 2012, Hamm made similar comments about superhero movies and his place outside of that genre.<br /> <br />  My name has come up in a lot of superhero discussions,  <a href= http://www.ifc.com/fix/2012/03/jon-hamm-superhero-movies-friends-with-kids-superman  target= _hplink >Hamm said to IFC</a>.  It's a tough thing, you know? It's a tough game to get into. I have mad, crazy respect for the people that can pull it off because it's something that can be done poorly so easily. But, you know, it's a big commitment and it's probably something that, unless it's the right thing, it's probably not so much my jam. <br /> <br /> While not working as Don Draper, his iconic  Mad Men  role, Hamm has indeed taken to more niche types of projects. This week, he will appear in  White Christmas,  the holiday special of acclaimed U.K. sci-fi show  Black Mirror.  The star recently <a href= http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/interviews/a616435/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-jon-hamm-on-the-dark-side-of-yuletide.html#~oYwCaKAB7HcNDd  target= _hplink >opened up</a> to Digital spy about what drew him to the show.<br /> <br />  I'd seen both previous series and absolutely loved it,  he said.

"Artists Explore The Influence And History Of Ebony And Jet Magazines"	" Think about the fact that since the 1940s, Ebony has been published, every month, and continues to be,  explained Lauren Hayes, curator at the Studio Museum in Harlem, in an interview with The Huffington Post.  It's about taking stock of this moment, thinking about what that says and if it says anything at all, really. <br /> <br /> Hayes curated the ongoing exhibition  <a href= http://www.studiomuseum.org/exhibition/speaking-people-emebonyem-emjetem-and-contemporary-art  target= _hplink >Speaking of People: Ebony, Jet and Contemporary Art</a>,  an inter-generational, multidisciplinary look at the influence of these two long-running black publications on the consciousness of contemporary artists. <br /> <br />  <a href= http://www.artnews.com/2014/11/11/ebony-and-jet-at-the-studio-museum-in-harlem/  target= _hplink >They were the first magazines of their kind</a>,  Linda Johnson Rice, chairman of the Johnson Publishing Company, told ArtNews. The Johnson Publishing Company began publishing Ebony in November of 1945 and, after selling out their initial run in under a month, haven't stopped since. Six years later a sister publication, Jet, was added to the agenda. <br /> <br /> <img alt= jet  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386872/thumbs/o-JET-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>Godfried Donkor, Ebony Accra edition, 2014 Collage on paper 27 1⁄2 × 39 9/25 in. Courtesy the artist</small></center><br /> <br />  The magazines were born out of a need that my parents saw, that there were no magazines that really spoke to black people. Ebony wrote about architects and artists, the share cropper who sent his nine kids to college, real African Americans at a time when everyone else only covered them as entertainers and athletes. <br /> <br /> Around 70 years after the magazines' beginnings, Hayes noticed the immense impact the printed publications were having on artists of all different ages and backgrounds.  About two years ago, we noticed there were a lot of artists thinking about and using materials from the magazine, particularly around the time of an exhibition here at the museum called  <a href= http://www.studiomuseum.org/exhibition/david-hartt-stray-light  target= _hplink >The Stray Light</a>,  featuring work by photographer David Hartt, who had access to the Johnson's old publishing building.<br /> <br /> <img alt= eg  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386878/thumbs/o-EG-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>Ellen Gallagher , DeLuxe, 2004–5 Portfolio of sixty etchings with photogravure, spitbite, collage, laser-cutting, screenprint, offset lithography, hand painting and Plasticine</small></center><br /> <br />  It became what felt like a really great moment to look and explore and see how many artists -- which artists and what artists were doing with these materials. Particularly works like Ellen Gallagher's 'Delux' which is in the museum's collection and we've shown other times, but wanting to bring out this particular aspect of it.  <br /> <br /> The exhibition features work from 16 artists including Hank Willis Thomas, Godfried Donkor, Glenn Ligon, Kerry James Marshall and Martine Syms. While some created work especially for the show, all had previously explored either thematic or material elements of Ebony and Jet in some way prior to the exhibition. Some artists incorporate physical elements of the magazine into their work, while others operate on a more conceptual plane, exploring the space opened up by these two periodicals. <br /> <br /> <img alt= hw  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386888/thumbs/o-HW-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>Hank Willis Thomas, Jet People, 2010 Gouache acrylic on canvas 20 × 40 in. Courtesy the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York © Hank Willis Thomas</small></center><br /> <br /> The diversity of the artists on view speaks to the diversity of the black experience.  There's a wide range of artists working in different materials, different ways,  said Hayes.  What was really exciting to me was to have a common source material but it wasn't just, <em>Oh, all artists are in this time or this place or working in a certain material.</em> There was a range and a wide array of artists using the materials. Just the breadth that Ebony and Jet have had and continue to have. <br /> <br /> The exhibition also touches on the precarious status print media holds in the quickly digitizing culture around us. Jet stopped its print publication earlier this year.  I think this is one of those interesting moments in the conversation that happens so often around print media and magazines -- if it's dying, if everything is moving digital, what it means?  <br /> <br /> <img alt= pp  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386894/thumbs/o-PP-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>Ellen Gallagher, Hare, 2013 Ink, watercolor, oil, pencil and cut paper on paper 44 4/5 × 46 3/5 in.

"Lorna Luft On Her Legacy, The Holidays And Her New Show At New York's 54 Below"	"Lorna Loft loves a good Christmas celebration, and for good reason. She's been associated with the holiday season since she was 11 years old, when she made her show business debut performing alongside her mother, Judy Garland, on <a href= http://www.christmastvhistory.com/2013/12/judy-garland-christmas-show-1963.html  target= _hplink >the 1963 Christmas episode</a> of  The Judy Garland Show.  <br /> <br /> Luft, now 62, has come a long way since her days of singing  Santa Claus is Coming to Town  on the now-iconic TV special. The singer-actress has been seen in the movies, on Broadway and on concert stages around the world. But she couldn't be happier about returning to Manhattan for the holidays, and says her three forthcoming cabaret performances at <a href= http://54below.com/artist/lorna-luft/  target= _hplink >New York's 54 Below</a> on Dec. 17 and 18, will have their own personal significance. <br /> <br />  In my opinion, New York City is the only place to be for Christmas,  the show business veteran, who currently lives in Palm Springs, California, told The Huffington Post in an interview.  It's the excitement, it's the tradition, it's Radio City, it's the hustle and the bustle and the craziness of the streets.  <br /> <br /> <iframe width= 570  height= 428  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/oBn9SqfA9tI  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe><br /> <center><em>Luft performs on  The Judy Garland Show  in 1963.</em></center><br /> <br /> Luft said audiences can expect a number of holiday songs in her new act, as well as a selection of show tunes and standards that she's carefully curated so that  every single song has a personal meaning.  Featured in the set is a loving tribute to composer Johnny Mercer as well as  <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yudgy30Dd68  target= _hplink >Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</a>,  which Garland introduced in 1944's  <a href= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037059/?ref_=nv_sr_1  target= _hplink >Meet Me In St. Louis</a>.  <br /> <br />  I think being able to sing a Christmas classic that was written for a member of your family is pretty amazing,  she said.  There are very few of us who can have that gift … like 'Over The Rainbow,' it's a such a huge, timeless classic, and to know I have that as part of my legacy is very, very cool.  <br /> <br /> 54 Below, she added, was a natural choice for her shows given the club's location in the basement of the former Studio 54, one of her former hangouts. <br /> <br /> <img alt= lorna luft oscars  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2390926/thumbs/o-LORNA-LUFT-OSCARS-570.jpg  /><br /> <center><em>Luft attended the 2014 Oscars, which honored the 75th anniversary of  The Wizard of Oz  starring Garland, with brother Joey Luft and half-sister Liza Minnelli. </em></center><br /> <br />  I spent a lot of time at Studio 54 in the '80s, and they tell me I had a good time,  Luft quipped with a laugh.  It was a period of time that was so fantasic -- yes, it was decadent; yes, it was over the top -- and I was lucky to have been a part of that. I've in that basement, but it sure as hell didn't look like that nightclub.  <br /> <br /> Joking aside, Luft has had other struggles and milestones in recent years. In 2013, she <a href= http://www.today.com/klgandhoda/lorna-luft-battles-cancer-i-was-terrified-chemo-8C11418983  target= _hplink >underwent treatment for breast cancer</a>, which she previously described as  <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/01/lorna-luft-pink-party_n_3902502.html  target= _hplink >being punched in the face by Muhammad Ali</a>, George Foreman and Mike Tyson all at once.  On a brighter note, she welcomed her first granddaughter, <a href= http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2014/liz-smith-a-treasure-has-been-lost  target= _hplink >Jordan Eloise Richards</a>, earlier this year. <br /> <br /> Luft, who is now cancer-free, said both experiences have taught her to  live in the moment  and have helped shape the message of her new show. <br /> <br />  Treasure your past, but live in the moment, and appreciate every single thing you have today,  she said.  If you constantly live for what's coming up in three weeks, you will be disappointed. If you live in the moment, you're never disappointed.  <br /> <br /> <em>Lorna Luft plays New York's 54 Below on Dec. 17 and 18. <a href= http://54below.com/artist/lorna-luft/  target= _hplink >Head here for more information</a>. </em> "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 09:56:24 -0500"	"arts"
"Fleshy Stilettos Made With Human Hair Question The 'Sexiness' Of High Heels"	"Artist <a href= http://www.zhutian.co.uk/about/  target= _hplink >Zhu Tian</a> crafts high heels. Only instead of creating footwear from leather, plastic or suede, she uses a far more unconventional medium: human flesh. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's rubber, but the China-born, London-based artist yields such a realistic looking specimen we'd surely believe the grotesque pumps were made of the same stuff as the feet squeezed inside them. The wiry human hairs on top -- which, to be clear, are <em>actually</em> human -- finish off the fleshy fashion statement.<br /> <br /> <center><img alt= artist  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2392682/original.jpg  /></center><br /> <br />  This work was a special project commissioned by ELLE China for their 25th anniversary,  the artist explained to HuffPost.  ELLE invited me to create a work using a pair of Dior’s stilettos. I was trying to question and challenge the 'sexy' image of high heels in contemporary culture. Are they inherently sexy? Or are we ‘told' they are sexy? <br /> <br /> To question our immediate associations between stilettos and sex, Zhu constructs forms at once viscerally attractive and repulsive, pinning our contradictory learned reactions against each other.  By creating this stiletto-shaped sculpture from an ambiguous combination of flesh-like texture and human hair, the intention was to deconstruct the stereotype of the femininity of high heels,  she continued.  Hopefully, the new possibility of a more individual and objective reading is revealed as a result. <br /> <br /> To top off the jumble of flesh and fashion, Zhu hangs some of her sculptures from string and chains, associating them both with BDSM and the binds of consumer desire.  <a href= http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/995181/elles-shoe-fetish-show-art-that-heels-opens-at-v-art-center  target= _hplink >Zhu’s work makes the sexual connotations of high heels explicit</a>, both as ‘lust-worthy’ commodities and as accessories that mechanically increase sexual attractiveness by lengthening legs and raising buttocks,  Sam Gaskin wrote in ArtInfo.

"Raw Photos Depict The Magic Of Motherhood, From A Father's Perspective"	" Drei  is the third segment in photographer's <a href= http://fredhuening.de/  target= _hplink >Fred Huening</a>'s visual trilogy. The earlier portions,  Einer  and  Zwei,  followed Huening as he fell in love with his girlfriend and later, more tragically, as the two gave birth to a still born child. The final installment captures life after the birth of his healthy son, documenting the beginning of his family of three. <br /> <br /> For those who don't speak German, the series titles translate to  One,   Two  and  Three.  <br /> <br /> <img alt= laugh  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2372322/thumbs/o-LAUGH-900.jpg  /><br /> <br /> The final chapter in Huening's visual story revolves around  motherhood, motherly love and the mystery of childhood,  the artist explained to The Huffington Post. The images chronicle those small yet miraculous early days of parenthood, the magic of every swim, every lunch, every round of dress-up, every nap. <br /> <br />  I hope that the viewer will get a notion of the lost or forgotten mysteries and wonders of childhood,  Huening explained.  I want them to feel or react the way I did, when I became a father at the age of almost 40. Before that happened I never planned to have a child. And my memories of my own childhood were lost and hidden in my mind. When I saw my son growing up I rediscovered my own childhood through him and this was magic. <br /> <br /> <img alt= love  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2372318/thumbs/o-LOVE-900.jpg  /><br /> <br /> Huening's images aren't, however, purely sentimental and blissful. While some are filled with joy and light, others radiate with ambivalence -- alluding to the family's broken past and changing future.  When my son was born my girlfriend turned from a lover into a mother,  Huening explained.  Her love and attention concentrated (of course) on my son. So I felt sometimes like an outsider observing the 'inner circle' of mother and son. I had ambivalent feelings and so I took my camera to express my emotions. <br /> <br /> In its entirety, however, Huening's portrait is one of raw and staggering beauty. The intimate depiction of motherhood and family may not depict the entire story, but it surely captures some intimate aspect of reality.  <a href= http://lucidamagazine.com/?p=2653  target= _hplink >My goal was to say something universal and deeply human</a>,  the artist told Lucida Magazine.

"This Is The Beautiful Result Of Shocking Polaroids With 15,000 Volts"	"Once upon a time, a Brooklyn-based artist named <a href= http://phillipstearns.wordpress.com/  target= _hplink >Phillip Stearns</a> stumbled upon a collection of instant color Fujifilm. Sadly, without the requisite camera, he couldn't produce the spur-of-the-moment, four-by-five gems Polaroid fans love. Instead, he decided to just shock the hell out of the film, with around 15,000 volts from a neon transformer. Because, why not?<br /> <br /> <img alt= blue  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2382636/thumbs/o-BLUE-900.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> His clever experiment, conducted with two electrodes and a copper plate, was a success. So much so that his methods got even weirder. He introduced chemicals (bleach, window cleaner) and pantry items (salt, baking soda) to this electric process, eventually adding in pigments and silver halide. All of these elements blend with light during the development stages to create strangely celestial portraits. He has some control over the images that burst forth, he explained in an <a href= http://motherboard.vice.com/read/high-voltage-how-to-take-psychedelic-fractal-photos-with-lightning  target= _hplink >interview with Motherboard</a>, but the rest is left up to chemical spontaneity. <br /> <br />  These treatments approach the film technology as a recording media, capable of creating images from physical, electrical, and chemical transformations,  Stearns wrote on his past <a href= https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phillipstearns/high-voltage-image-making  target= _hplink >Kickstarter page</a>. There he also cites artists like Man Ray, Pierre Cordier, Marco Breuer, Chris McCaw and Hiroshi Sugimoto as inspiration.

"Cavafy's Cultural Politics and the Poetics of Liminality"	"Probing the work of C. P. Cavafy has been intriguing for me, not only because he is one of the most influential figures in twentieth-century European aesthetic culture, but also for another reason: as Cavafy records in his diary of his first trip to Greece in 1901 (written in English), he was positively predisposed toward the work of Georgios Roilos, an influential late nineteenth-early twentieth-century Greek painter, among the first to introduce impressionism in Greece, a professor and mentor of, among other artists, Giorgio de Chirico. In his diary entry for June 28, 1901, Cavafy reports that he visited Roilos in his studio and enjoyed his painting  The Battle of Pharsala :  At 4:30 I took the direction of the Polytechneion. The first person I met in the Odos Patision was Tsocopoulo [sic], who accompanied me to the Polytechneion and conducted me to the painter Roilos's study to see this artist's great picture 'The Battle of Pharsala.'  That encounter of the poet with the painter is one of the stories often narrated at home when I was a child -- stories that later determined my scholarly attachment to cultural history and art. <br /> <br /> Cavafy was born (in 1863) and spent most of his life in the periphery of the Greek-speaking world, in Alexandria, Egypt, where he died in 1933. Although a fervent patriot and lover of all things Greek, his cosmopolitan experiences (he spent some years of his childhood in England and of his late adolescence in Constantinople) and especially his diasporic mentality contributed to his critical approach to aspects of the cultural and political life of mainland Greece. His stance toward cultural matters, history, and morality was greatly influenced, on the one hand, by his multicultural open-mindedness, and, on the other, by his own marked (geographical but, more crucially, I believe, socio-aesthetic) liminality. <br /> <br /> Cavafy's diasporic experience contributed to the formation of his overall cultural politics, which continues to inspire an exceptionally large number of readers, poets, scholars, intellectuals, and activists throughout the world. The everlasting appeal of his discourse to contemporary readership was evocatively demonstrated and celebrated at an event I organized at Harvard last year to celebrate the end of the so-called Cavafy Year: at that event, in which no less than 27 Harvard colleagues and graduate students participated as readers, one of his most famous poems,  Ithaca,  was recited in 27 different languages! <br /> <br /> In general, cultural politics is to be understood as a two-way process: it refers, on the one hand, to the impact of political ideologies and practices on the production and consumption of cultural commodities; and, on the other, to the intricate ways in which the latter respond to, and even shape, aspects of the former. Cultural politics and Cavafy can be explored from many different, but, essentially, complementary perspectives. For instance, it can address the following questions: how his work is received by agents of politically determined or at least politically informed ideological discourses and practices (nationalism, postcolonialism, gender and queer studies, etc.); or how specific poems may reflect specific political and social concerns in his contemporary Alexandrian or wider Greek contexts; or, how the content of his mature work (produced and published from the late 1890s onward but especially after 1911) as well as his stylistic choices, especially the gradual development of a poetic discourse that was, at least according to the established criteria of poeticity of the time, closer to prose than to poetry (and as such, an inherently liminal discourse), undermined dominant socio-aesthetic premises. My emphasis in this piece is on these last aspects of the complex topic  Cavafy and cultural politics,  which may be relevant to broader debates in related intellectual and scholarly fields as well.  <br /> <br /> Cavafy, who had famously declared that, if he were not a poet he would have most happily been a historian, demonstrates an astute historical, political, and, of course, aesthetic sensitivity throughout his (published and unpublished) work, especially from the middle of (what I have called) his allegorical period (1890s) onward. By contrast to cultural and ideological paradigms dominating his contemporary Greek and broader European intellectual production, Cavafy was particularly attracted not so much to the achievements of the famous classical past as, rather, to transitional periods of ancient and medieval Greek history: the era following Alexander the Great's expeditions to the East and the establishment of the Hellenistic kingdoms; late antiquity; Byzantium. <br /> <br /> Not unlike betwixt-and-between phases -- more often than not ritually negotiated -- in an individual's or a community's life, such periods frequently bear the symptoms of ambivalent liminality: to a great extent determined by critical, potentially both destructive and creative,  risky  and reinvigorating, tensions between opposing conceptual, ideological, and broader sociocultural categories (familiar/unfamiliar; foreign/domestic; us/others; past/present;), liminal eras in history, at least as perceived and approached by Cavafy, are, to a lesser or greater degree, marked by open-endedness, inclusiveness (syncretism), and what I prefer to call amphoteroglossic ( double-tongued,  i.e. ambivalent) fluidity.  <br /> <br /> Cavafy's subversion of moral and gender hierarchies, too, as this was powerfully manifested through his outspoken celebration of homoerotic desire mainly in his mature years, decisively contributed to the liminality of his overall cultural politics and poetic revolution. His highly original, often  secularized  redefinition of aspects of the aesthetics and ethics of the so-called  Hellenic love,  as these had been developed especially in Western European (notably British) aestheticism, was based on a radical destabilization of ethical, cultural, and even economic principles of post-industrialist European societies. As I have argued elsewhere, his celebration of both homoerotic desire and poetic creativity were conceptualized and articulated in terms of what I call an  anti-economy of jouissance,  a kind of  economy  that prioritizes excess, consumption, and (self-)expenditure at the expense of the dominant economic principles of profit and utility. <br /> <br /> For Cavafy, poetry constitutes a daring exemplification of such an anti-economy, since it often involves creation through (self-)expenditure and loss -- or, in terms of ritual poetics, through self-sacrifice. His conceptualization of poetic creativity as an instantiation of a broader economico-erotic liminality is eloquently expressed in a poem that bears the characteristically ritualistic title  Passage,  in which initiation into the  world  of poetry is described as a rite of passage indeed. That poem, which was written in 1914 and published in 1917, reads as follows (in my rather literal translation):<br /> <br /> <em><br /> Those things that as a student he coyly imagined are opened,<br /> revealed before him. And he keeps roaming and staying up at night,<br /> and being led astray. And as is (for our art) right,<br /> hedonic pleasure enjoys <br /> his blood, fresh and warm. An unlawful <br /> erotic intoxication defeats his body; and his youthful <br /> limbs succumb to it.<br />  And thus, a simple youth<br /> becomes worthy for us to see, and though the Sublime<br /> World of Poetry he, too, one moment passes--<br /> the aesthetic youth with blood fresh and warm. </em> "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 09:26:43 -0500"	"arts"
"An Illustrated Guide to Feminism"	"I posted an article on my <a href= http://iambeggingmymothernottoreadthisblog.com/2014/11/14/literally-i-cant/  target= _hplink >personal blog</a> recently that received feedback in the comments section. It questioned my definition of feminism as  simplistic.  I had cribbed mine from Merriam-Webster and Google: <br /> <br /> <em>Feminism (n): advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.  </em><br /> <br />  Of course I used a simple definition,  I wanted to argue.  No one will understand me if it's complicated. You have to crawl before you can walk.  <br /> <br /> I thought for awhile about how best to respond. I thought for awhile about why I believe in the power of simple definitions. I thought for awhile about how the word  feminism  has a really bad reputation, and about how a major source of negative stereotypes seems to stem from a lack of understanding about the meaning of the word. <br /> <br /> And then, I drew some pictures. <br /> <br /> ... OK, I drew some admittedly terrible pictures. Using that old standby of artists' mediums, the paintbrush tool on Microsoft Paint. (Hey, I only said I was a blogger. I never claimed to be an artist). <br /> <br /> I don't know that much. Frankly, I'm not sure if I even got it right. I'm not a feminist scholar. I'm just a blogger who cares. <br /> <br /> But it is a start. A definition is a very good place to start. <br /> <br /> I hope it will help. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-01iamafeminist.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-01iamafeminist.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-01iamafeminist-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-02iamafeminist.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-02iamafeminist.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-02iamafeminist-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-03assumptions.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-03assumptions.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-03assumptions-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-04angryfeminist.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-04angryfeminist.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-04angryfeminist-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-updated1.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-updated1.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-updated1-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-new05aboutme1.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-new05aboutme1.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-new05aboutme1-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-donthatemen1.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-donthatemen1.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-donthatemen1-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-lemonface1.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-lemonface1.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-lemonface1-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-2evilfeminism.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-2evilfeminism.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-2evilfeminism-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-3beyonce.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-3beyonce.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-3beyonce-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-definitiondictionary.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-definitiondictionary.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-definitiondictionary-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-thatsit.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-thatsit.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-thatsit-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-bellhooks.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-bellhooks.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-bellhooks-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-feminismchange1.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-feminismchange1.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-feminismchange1-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-complicated.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-complicated.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-complicated-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-iknow.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-iknow.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-iknow-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-someofyou.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-someofyou.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-someofyou-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-feminist1.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-22-feminist1.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-22-feminist1-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <strong>ALSO ON HUFFPOST:</strong><br /> <HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--363220--HH> "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 09:21:58 -0500"	"arts"

As a collection, these portraits explore how the latest generation of contemporary artists operate in their relative intersections, navigate New York's dynamic art scene and adopt hybrid forms of visual expression.

Around us: quasi-floor-to-ceiling paintings on gessoed wooden panels -- two unfinished, all looming overhead like a congregation of sacred idols. It's been years since he's touched them.<br /> <br /> But according to Echahly, these works haven't been put out to pasture just yet.  They're not done,  he explains,  I'll get around to finishing them. <br /> <br /> Until then, he's on the frontier of a relatively new method of painting, and he's using an apparatus that he characterizes as an extension of his mind. With deep fondness (and an equally deep voice), he tells me its utility translates his ideas with the speed and precision that his imagination demands. By the same token, he's uncovering inventive ways to manipulate the medium, subsequently pushing its boundaries.<br /> <br /> Behold: symbiosis at its finest.<br /> <br /> But before the big reveal, let's circle back to the start.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-EchahlyOldStudioUpload.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-07-EchahlyOldStudioUpload.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-EchahlyOldStudioUpload-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> Echahly in his South Slope studio<br /> <br /> We first meet in Chelsea. <br /> <br /> The neighborhood is familiar stomping grounds for the artist, who spent his formative years growing up in downtown Manhattan -- a detail he reveals as we walk the length of the pier leading down to the Jane Hotel. Inside: a hidden lounge-cafe complete with posh, low-seated sofas and mismatched chandeliers has just opened its doors.<br /> <br /> Our conversation eventually turns to his occasional tendency to drop off the grid -- a habit he's working to correct. Even those close under the vest are often left in the dark for periods of time.  I'll just disappear for a while. I don't answer texts, phone calls, or Facebook messages. It's sad.  For an artist who values connectivity, it's a consequence that he's actively taking steps to prevent.<br /> <br /> But the question stands: what does he do during these spells?<br /> <br /> I ask him. He's hesitant to answer.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-AdamStudioUpload.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-07-AdamStudioUpload.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-AdamStudioUpload-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> Echahly at the Jane Hotel<br /> <br /> Then again, he's also hesitant to share anything on his social feed or to unveil his work. It's a reservation that stems from a deep respect for everyone's (yes, everyone's) time and opinion.  I try to be responsible with what I put out in the world,  he admits. It's a value system that makes him responsible in all the ways that count.<br /> <br /> At length, with intervals of silence between us, his answer arrives. He recalls late nights ambling around the deserted warehouse district of South Slope; working odd jobs; and long, insightful conversations with Ali, a writer and his primary confidant. Together, they've cultivated a delicate and private space where honesty is the only criterion for peer review. Their conversations have and continue to hold import in much of Echahly's artistic growth.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-AdamAllieUpload.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-07-AdamAllieUpload.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-AdamAllieUpload-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 379  /></a><br /> Echahly and Ali<br /> <br /> We wrap up at the Jane and make moves for Brooklyn.<br /> <br /> The subject of his undergraduate experience comes up during the commute. From his first year at the Art Institute of Chicago, to his dalliance with the School of Visual Arts, and now, his enrollment at Parsons, Echahly relays his reasons for embarking on an art-school blitz.<br /> <br /> Echahly sees formal instruction in the arts as an increasingly commodified product. Schools devise distinct identities and package them for mass consumption. Though it's a sentiment that arguably applies to higher education at large, its presence pervades the realm of visual art in a very specific way.  You can tell when someone studied at Chicago, or Cooper. They're stamped with this specific aesthetic.  They're brands that Echahly would rather do without -- exclusively, at least. <br /> <br /> Guided by a curatorial approach, Echahly is interested in the creation of images using disparate sources and influences -- a process he describes as kin to  completing a jigsaw puzzle.  At galleries, on walks, during train rides, Echahly's eyes are scanning around the clock for a leg or an eye or a pattern that fits into his paintings. And once he finds it, the real work begins. <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-AdamSculptureUpload.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-07-AdamSculptureUpload.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-AdamSculptureUpload-thumb.jpg  width= 380  height= 570  /></a></center><br /> Echahly with previous works (painting and furniture/sculpture)<br /> <br /> Collage-work was Echahly's natural starting point, but once he discovered the magic of Photoshop and digital painting, he's been predisposed to eschew traditional mediums. <br /> <br /> Well-versed as he is with acrylics and oils, their limitations render them unsuitable vehicles for his vision. Take, for example, the time-consuming process of mixing colors or stretching a canvas. As far as Echahly sees it, he'd rather be experimenting with entire compositions on Photoshop in the time it would've taken him to batter up some alizarin-red. So these days, Echahly's been spending the crux of his time working in a portable studio: his MacBook (or any computer for that matter).<br /> <br /> Here, in this virtual studio, the artist maximizes on time and space. Within seconds, every color, texture, and scale is at the artist's disposal, and the impulse to generate hundreds of pieces is readily supported by a 16  x 9  storage unit. <br /> <br /> It's undoubtedly a radical statement, challenging popular notions of an artist's studio space. But in a market where even the cheapest brands of supplies and materials are expensive commodities, it's a protest to the financial inaccessibility of painting that ought to be expressed more often.<br /> <br /> Besides, the appeal of making art on a Brooklyn rooftop doesn't hurt.<br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-AdamStudioSpaceUpload.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-07-AdamStudioSpaceUpload.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-AdamStudioSpaceUpload-thumb.jpg  width= 441  height= 570  /></a></center><br /> (Top) Echahly at work (Bottom) Echahly's studio <br /> <br /> Technology's incorporation into the broader language of visual art, while still largely undefined, is a transition that Echahly's interested in exploring -- digital painting being the overlap of his choice. In 100, even 200 layers, Echahly creates virtual compositions that allow him to trace his growth and return to earlier stages -- both of which are privileges that physical painting can't afford its artists.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-Thinking.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-07-Thinking.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-Thinking-thumb.jpg  width= 519  height= 570  /></a><br /> Echahly, Adam.

New York.<br /> <br /> It's a little after 3AM and we're sitting in his South Slope studio.<br /> <br /> Offhandedly, eyes fixed on his Macbook, he invites me for a walk, which for him is a surefire source of inspiration. Come Indian summer or polar vortex, Echahly will walk undeterred. But with a number of plans laying in wait beyond graduation, these invitations will be all the rarer.<br /> <br /> Among them (and what he hopes will happen in the immediate future): a trip to Morocco, his homeland, as well as excursions to peripheral states where Echahly intends to exchange ideas with the locals. At once an immersion in his heritage and an exposure to new methods of artistic thought, the trip is sure to yield him powerful material to integrate into his own work. For an artist who readily embraces the experiences and opinions of others, what he'll learn from the region is certain to leave an indelible mark.<br /> <br /> But until then he'll be in New York, and if you happen to be in his neck of the woods, feel free to reach out to him: He'll invite you for a walk.<br /> <br /> <iframe width= 560  height= 315  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/CRcrUJdLNGs  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe> "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 09:20:22 -0500"	"arts"
"Heroic Donors"	"I have written a great deal about the various approaches that help troubled arts organizations reestablish financial stability. Developing a turnaround plan that reveals longer-term artistic plans, aggressive institutional marketing campaigns and proposes a restructured board is one key approach that I have found to be useful. Without such a plan, every interested party tries to implement their favorite strategy, often at odds with the strategies of other interested parties, and little good is accomplished. A turnaround requires concerted, focused action.<br /> <br /> But I have never written about one important element in most turnarounds: the role of the heroic donor.<br /> <br /> I am not talking about a mega-millionaire who gives a life-sustaining gift. If not accompanied by more fundamental changes like the ones mentioned above, a one-time cash infusion may prolong life but not ensure it.<br /> <br /> I am referring to those few donors who recognize that after the turnaround plan has been developed, there is a lag time before most of the strategies bear fruit. I believe fervently that those organizations that create and implement strong turnaround plans can be saved -- arts organizations rarely can get terribly sick because no one is willing to lend us very much money! But it takes time for new, exciting programming to be developed, for marketing campaigns to be formulated, for potent new board members to be engaged and for the funding community to trust that these changes will have a substantial impact.<br /> <br /> Since most troubled arts institutions are cash-strapped, how can they survive while their new strategies take root? The answer is, of course, that we must rely on a few of our best friends who are so passionate about the organization and who are excited by the future plans and who are willing to contribute when others are reticent.<br /> <br /> These are the heroic donors who are so critical to the turnaround.  These are the people who must be honored and celebrated for their willingness to give courageously in the face of extreme pessimism from all sides.<br /> <br /> While there certainly is an element of luck involved when searching for these heroic few, the organizations that have built a cadre of dedicated supporters almost always have a few who simply cannot imagine the organization going away and are willing to put their resources where their passion resides.<br /> <br /> I have benefitted greatly over my career from these heroic donors who have allowed me to pursue the turnaround strategies that seemed most apt for each institution with which I have worked. I know that none of these strategies would have had a chance to blossom had I not received the support from these loyal and generous supporters, each of whom retains a very special place in my heart.<br /> <br /> And I would be lying if I did not admit that even when I ran healthy institutions, I was combing the list of donors, deciding which ones would be my  go-to  heroes in case of a sudden downturn in our fortunes. They did not know they were on my target list, but I went out of my way to engage them in our work; they were my insurance policies for a rainy day. "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 09:12:39 -0500"	"arts"
"'Selma' Cast & Director Wear 'I Can't Breathe' Shirts At Premiere"	" Selma  had its New York City premiere on Sunday, the day after the <a href= https://www.facebook.com/events/959630214065046/  target= _hplink >Millions March</a>, a civil rights protest in which at least 25,000 people walked through Manhattan demanding justice following the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Akai Gurley.<br /> <br /> While celebrating the film, director Ava DuVernay and the cast -- David Oyelowo, E. Roger Mitchell, Wendell Pierce, Omar Dorsey, John Lavelle, Stephan James, Kent Faulcon, Lorraine Toussaint, Andre Holland, Tessa Thompson and Colman Domingo -- stood on the steps of the New York Public Library, wearing shirts that read  I Can't Breathe.

Oyelowo, who plays Dr. Martin Luther King in the film, said at the premiere,  <a href= http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/selma-stars-poignancy-parallels-movie-27600400  target= _hplink >We couldn't have predicted what would happen in terms of what's going on, race relations-wise</a>.

And I was hooked. I wouldn’t call it love -- it was more of a rush of excitement. Six months later, it's midway through our senior year of high school -- and the last six months together were the happiest I had ever been in my life. He was still intoxicating, he gave me butterflies and he had more control over me than he’d ever know, then I’d ever known. <br /> <br /> Well, December, over our winter break, I decided it was time for sex. But little did I know it was not my choice at all. I was not explicitly pressured, but internally pressured. He was my first REAL boyfriend, the person I thought I loved (I’ll explain why I said “thought”). I thought it was just the next step. He wanted to and I wanted him to be happy.<br /> <br /> See, “love” is just a release of oxytocin and drop of serotonin that makes us do crazy things. It makes our hearts race and gives us butterflies, and makes us irrational. It's a drug, really. And it SHOULDN’T be this feeling. It should be a choice -- not to commit to another person, but to commit to yourself first. I didn’t love myself enough to hold onto my belief of waiting, so how could I say loved him? If I loved myself, and if I loved him, I would have waited. I regret not waiting. And like I said earlier, it's a drug and I’m hooked. So even a year later, we still have awkward, funny, amazing and exhausting sex, and at that moment, when I’m on that high, I’m on top of the world. But when the high comes back down, I realize I still don’t love myself, and I regret not loving myself enough to walk away from my Temptation, my Little Drug. To me, the word “sex” means you better love yourself first, before you try loving anyone else.<br /> <br /> I was 17. I was a senior in high school. I had top grades and an amazing boyfriend. I got into some of the best colleges in the country. But underneath it all, I didn’t love myself. Sex means knowing yourself first before trying to trust another person, trusting you are mature enough to handle it, and if you are the slightest bit unsure, just wait. I wish I knew myself that night on Christmas Eve. Now I’m 18 and in college, and I have to admit I still don’t know myself. I’m still with the same guy, but after we have sex, I think back to that night and wish I waited.<br /> <br /> <em>Follow HuffPost Teen on <a href= https://twitter.com/HuffPostTeen ><img src=

"Homeless Kids' Letters To Santa Remind Us Not Everyone Will Have A Happy Holiday (How To Help)"	"Not every child will wake up on Dec. 25 to a mound of presents under the Christmas tree. Some won't even wake up with a permanent roof over their head.<br /> <br /> Youth homelessness in the U.S. has reached unprecedented levels. According to a report released last month by the National Center on Family Homelessness, nearly <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/17/child-homelessless-us_n_6169994.html  target= _hplink >2.5 million</a> American children were without stable shelter at some point in 2013 -- an all-time high.<br /> <br />  While losing one’s home is difficult for anyone, <a href= http://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/event/2014-holiday-toy-drive/  target= _hplink >it is devastating for a child</a>,  the <a href= http://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/event/2014-holiday-toy-drive/  target= _hplink >Coalition For The Homeless</a> claims, noting kids must cope with losing friends, prized possessions and the comforts of familiar surroundings when they become homeless.<br /> <br /> The New York City-based organization, which provides various services for those experiencing homelessness, received letters from children living in local family shelters.

"Is It Really Bad To Order Sushi On A Monday?"	"<a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daffnee-cohen/monday_b_5669462.html  target= _hplink >Mondays are the pits</a>. After a restorative weekend, you're forced back into reality and you feel like a lab rat stuck in a cubicle, studied for the effects fluorescent light has on skin. So after a <em>looonnggg</em> day at the office, all you want to do is unwind and get some <a href= http://sushiwithmygirls.com/  target= _hplink >sushi with your girls</a> and weep into a tall glass of sake. <br /> <br /> You <em>might</em> want to reconsider where you host this much-needed happy hour -- depending on where you tend to dine. Though sushi is delicious, and in some cases packed <a href= http://www.livestrong.com/article/501233-what-are-the-benefits-of-sushi/  target= _hplink >with healthy fats and fiber</a>, sushi and other fish <em>may</em> not be at its freshest on the first day of the workweek. Since most fresh fish markets are closed on Sundays, many assume that Monday's seafood dinner is, well, a little fishy.  <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some contradicting opinions about eating fish and sushi on Mondays. In his book,  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Adventures-Underbelly/dp/0060899220/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1418411318&sr=1-1&keywords=confidential+kitchen  target= _hplink >Kitchen Confidential</a>,  published in 2000, the ever-abrasive chef <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/anthony-bourdain/  target= _hplink >Anthony Bourdain</a> writes that seafood served on Monday is  about four to five days old,  and that he'd never eat it unless he knew the restaurant well. But, he redacts his statement in  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/Medium-Raw-Bloody-Valentine-People/dp/0061718947  target= _hplink >Medium Raw</a>,  published in 2010, <a href= https://books.google.com/books?id=5nkJydCGqFsC&lpg=PT768&ots=GDMR_otiVM&dq=%E2%80%9CEat%20the%20fucking%20fish%20on%20Monday%20already.%E2%80%9D&pg=PT768#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CEat%20the%20fucking%20fish%20on%20Monday%20already.%E2%80%9D&f=false  target= _hplink >in which he writes</a>,  But <em>eat</em> the fucking fish on Monday already. Okay? I wrote those immortal words about <em>not</em> going for the Monday fish, the ones that'll haunt me long after I'm crumbs in a can, knowing nothing other than New York City. And times, to be fair, have changed. <br /> <br /> Still, Bourdain enforces that <em>where</em> you order your fish matters, and the dive bar isn't really the best spot to do so -- especially on a Monday. When it comes to eating seafood, your geographic location is something to consider. “If you're dining near the coast or at a restaurant known for outstanding seafood, you probably don't need to pay attention to the calendar,  <a href= http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/menus/avoid-fish-on-mondays1.htm  target= _hplink >writes Cristen Conger for How Stuff Works.</a>  But if, let's say, you're in Kansas City or Reno, saltwater fish must be shipped to the restaurant. Most fresh fish wholesalers can ship fish overnight, but that usually isn't going to happen on a Sunday.” This makes sense. For this reason, it's important to be cautious of fish  specials  or discounted sushi offered on Sundays or Mondays. The restaurant may be trying to rid their kitchens of fish on its last <strike>legs</strike> fins, while trying to make a profit. <br /> <br /> Beyond a nausea-inducing stinky smell, there are health risks associated with eating fish that's past its prime. Raw fish may host parasites and bacteria that may lead to moderate illnesses with some uncomfortable side effects (think vomiting). The <a href= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/UCM252393.pdf  target= _hplink >FDA enforces specific freezing procedures for most food establishments</a> that serve fish raw. This process <a href= http://www.pbs.org/food/fresh-tastes/myth-sushi-grade/  target= _hplink >can help kill off</a> some of the threatening parasites. So, if you're dining out at a restaurant that knows the rules and wants its patrons to enjoy their meal, you really have nothing to worry about -- no matter the day of the week. <br /> <br /> <b><em>Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

"NFL's Personal Conduct Policy: A Step in the Right Direction"	"This fall, our nation watched in shock and horror as the surveillance video of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then fiancée, Janay Palmer, looped in seemingly endless rotation on thousands of platforms in our modern media era.<br /> <br /> That single video conveyed a deeply painful moment for one family and a deeply powerful image for us all. And yet, as someone who has spent an entire career working on domestic violence and sexual assault, it is amazing to me that the nation was so mesmerized by one video documenting one act when this type of violence is so common in households and relationships across this country. The reality is that nearly every minute in the United States, 20 people suffer intimate partner violence. That adds up to more than 12 million women and men over the course of a year--a shame on our society that we all bear.<br /> <br /> There is no question that the NFL mishandled the Rice matter. As Commissioner Roger Goodell said himself, they made mistakes. But in acknowledging those mistakes and addressing the issues inside the organization, the league is working to be part of the solution. <br /> <br /> And while it took a terrible act caught on tape to do it, there is good emerging from that disturbing video and the missteps of the NFL this summer and fall.<br /> <br /> Last week the NFL released its new Personal Conduct Policy. It details an expanded list of infractions compared to the 2007 policy, including actual or threatened physical violence against another person and assault or battery, including sexual assault and stalking, harassment or similar forms of intimidation. The disciplinary process, which was criticized for being vague and seemingly arbitrary in the 2007 policy, now explicitly details both the investigative procedures and the consequences for such infractions. For example, the policy sets a baseline suspension of six games without pay for violations involving assault, battery, domestic violence or sexual assault and states that certain aggravating circumstances could send that penalty higher.<br /> <br /> The policy also includes a multitude of new services for survivors who are going through this, giving families the resources needed to be safe, to get counseling and to heal. Not only that, but league-funded counseling and treatment services are provided to the alleged perpetrator, giving that individual a possible path back through rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> What this tells me, as an expert in this field, is that the NFL takes this problem seriously and has developed a response protocol that is not only tough, but also allows for all the complexities--including intense safety and financial fears--that make draconian, cookie-cutter, one-strike-and-you're-out responses to this violence seem appropriate, while they are in fact often counterproductive to reporting and physically dangerous to those being abused. And then there's the ongoing education process with all teams and NFL employees, through a required and powerful session on domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse, addressing basic definitions, warning signs, resources for help and how as collective bystanders we can all intervene. <br /> <br /> The NFL is making a strong commitment to change their culture. And for an organization that commands the attention of nearly 65 percent of Americans each week, making such a step is a potential game changer--especially in a country where 65 percent of companies sadly have no formal workplace domestic violence prevention policy. <br /> <br /> So, while it's easy to criticize the NFL, perhaps the rest of us should look within ourselves. These player incidents have thrust domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse issues into the national spotlight in an unprecedented way, but these incidents are hardly the beginning and end of the problem. Domestic violence and sexual assault permeate all strata of society. Can we all say that our own workplaces and communities are doing everything possible to prevent and respond to these issues effectively (or at all)?<br /> <br /> The NFL's updated conduct policy is by no means a cure-all. But it is a step in the right direction. It clearly articulates consequences. It shows support for and provides resources to survivors. It tells the fan base that domestic violence and sexual assault are not ok under any circumstances--in the NFL or frankly in society at-large. <br /> <br /> Let's all use this moment to drive broader change ourselves. The 20 people each minute who are suffering in the shadows, outside the glare of cameras, deserve no less. "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 11:10:56 -0500"	"sports"
"Game-Changing Plays from Week 15 in the NFL"	"To highlight the Live ScoreCaster, we will take our in-game technology, Live ScoreCaster, to the next level to review the game-changing plays from the NFL and what the game would have looked like if the plays had turned out differently. <br />  <br /> Click the header for each game to view the Game Breakdown for each matchup.<br />  <br /> <strong><u><a href= http://www.predictionmachine.com/Live/IndividualGame.aspx?lgid=12567  target= _hplink >Giants vs. Redskins</a></u></strong><br /> <br /> Odell Beckham Jr. caught three touchdowns as the New York Giants took advantage of an overturned touchdown at the end of the first half to beat the Washington Redskins 24-13. <br /> <br /> The game-defining play, the overturned touchdown at the end of the first half, occurred as time expired in the second quarter. Robert Griffin III scrambled for an eight yard touchdown but replay officials ruled that Griffin had lost possession of the football when he dove for the end zone and as a result the play was reversed.<br /> <br /> The Redskins led the Giants 10-7 at the half and were 52 percent likely to win. Had Griffin's touchdown stood, Washington leading 17-7 at the half, the Redskins' expected win probability increases to 70 percent.<br /> <br /> Adding insult to injury, the Redskins players, <a href= https://vine.co/v/O69PTdJ6OWF  target= _hplink >specifically Santana Moss</a>, were so upset by the ruling on the field at the end of the first half that they drew unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. The penalties were assessed on the second half kickoff. <br /> <br /> The penalties allowed the Giants to kick off from the Redskins 35-yard line. New York, because of the field position, decided to try an onside kick. The Giants successfully recovered the onside kick and became 66 percent likely to win. <br /> <br /> To recap, Washington saw the team's expected win probability swing from 70 percent (if Griffin's touchdown stands) to 34 percent following the Giants onside kick, which was set up by unsportsmanlike conduct penalties related to the Griffin touchdown not counting. <br /> <br /> For additional GameChanging notes from this game <strong><a href= http://www.predictionmachine.com/Live/IndividualGame.aspx?lgid=12567  target= _hplink >click here</a></strong>.<br /> <br /> <strong><u><a href= http://www.predictionmachine.com/Live/IndividualGame.aspx?lgid=12566  target= _hplink >Patriots vs. Dolphins</a></u></strong><br /> <br /> New England defeated Miami 41-13 to secure the Patriots sixth straight AFC East title. The Pats jumped on the Dolphins early when Jamie Collins blocked Caleb Sturgis' 41-yard field goal attempt on Miami's first possession and Kyle Arrington returned the ball 62 yards for a touchdown.<br /> <br /> The <a href= https://vine.co/v/O69atdzzrJa  target= _hplink >touchdown on a blocked field goal</a> made New England 85 percent likely to win. <br /> <br /> Had Miami converted the field goal attempt, the Dolphins expected win probability increases from 15 percent to 35 percent. <br /> <br /> For additional GameChanging notes from this game <strong><a href= http://www.predictionmachine.com/Live/IndividualGame.aspx?lgid=12566  target= _hplink >click here</a></strong>.<br /> <br /> <strong><u><a href= http://www.predictionmachine.com/Live/IndividualGame.aspx?lgid=12568  target= _hplink >Bengals vs. Browns</a></u></strong><br /> <br /> The Johnny Manziel era in Cleveland started with a 30-0 thrashing at the hands of rival Cincinnati. The Bengals dominated Johnny Football in his first career start. Manziel was 10-of-18 for 80 yards, two interceptions and was sacked three times. <br /> <br /> Pacman Jones intercepted Manziel and then did the <a href= https://vine.co/v/O69QXbT2xri  target= _hplink > money  sign</a>.

"Kobe Bryant Passes Michael Jordan For 3rd On NBA's All-Time Scoring List"	"<p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Kobe Bryant has reached rarefied air.</p><br />               <p>The Los Angeles Lakers star passed Michael Jordan for third on the NBA's career scoring list Sunday night in a 100-94 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.</p><br />               <p>Bryant entered the game needing nine points to pass the icon with whom he is often compared. He got the mark with two free throws with 5:24 to play in the second quarter.</p><br />               <p> I'm just honored to be here, man, to still be playing,  Bryant said.  I appreciate being able to play this long. Careers normally don't last this long. I really appreciate the opportunity to still be out there playing and performing and doing what I do. </p><br />               <p>Now only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone have scored more points than Bryant.</p><br />               <p> I congratulate Kobe on reaching this milestone,  Jordan, the owner of the Charlotte Hornets, said in a statement released to The Associated Press.  He's obviously a great player, with a strong work ethic and has an equally strong passion for the game of basketball.  I've enjoyed watching his game evolve over the years, and I look forward to seeing what he accomplishes next. </p><br />               <p>Bryant didn't break a record Sunday night. Abdul-Jabbar is still more than 6,000 points ahead of him and in no danger of being caught. But moving past Jordan was cause for celebration.</p><br />               <p>The two players have been linked for years and Bryant often mimicked Jordan from his earliest days in the league, from the way he pumped his fist after big shots to adopting the fade-away jumper as his career has progressed and even sprinkling in a little tongue-wagging on his drives to the bucket as a youth.</p><br />               <p> He knows how much I've learned from him,  Bryant said.  From the other legends, but him in particular. </p><br />               <p>The Timberwolves stopped the game, and a Lakers-heavy crowd gave Bryant a standing ovation as Wolves owner Glen Taylor — the NBA's chairman of the board — presented him with the game ball.</p><br />               <p>With a big smile on his face, Bryant received hugs from teammates and the Timberwolves, and waved to the crowd during the brief stoppage.</p><br />               <p>Bryant has been chasing Jordan for almost two decades now. He's still one title short of the six Jordan won with the Bulls, but has now caught Jordan in the game's defining individual statistic.</p><br />               <p>Bryant had 32,284 points when he took the floor against a Timberwolves team that includes 19-year-old rookies Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine, two players who were barely born when Bryant made his NBA debut in 1996.</p><br />               <p>He missed four of his first five field goals, but knocked down a 3-pointer midway through the second quarter to pull within two points. He nearly passed Jordan with one of his patented fall-away jumpers from the baseline, but it rimmed out and with 5:24 to play and 24 seconds on the shot clock, No. 24 stepped to the line and calmly swished two freebies to do it. He finished the night with 26 points and 32,310 for his career.</p><br />               <p>It took Bryant 1,269 games to reach the NBA's career scoring podium. Jordan amassed his 32,292 points in 1,039 regular-season games.</p><br />               <p>Jordan moved into third place in 2003, and the top of the NBA's scoring mountain had remained unchanged for nearly 12 years. Ever since Bryant really started to hit his stride as an elite scorer beginning with his fourth year in the league, he was widely considered the one to the record books would have to reserve a spot for.</p><br />               <p> Just like we've never seen another player like Michael Jordan, we will never see another player like Kobe Bryant!  Lakers Hall of Famer Magic Johnson tweeted.</p><br />               <p>Jordan retired and came back twice, giving up prime years that cost him a shot at Abdul-Jabbar's record. Jordan also played three years of college while Bryant jumped straight to the pros and started racking up the points, albeit at a gradual rate.</p><br />               <p>But Bryant endured his own hardship as he rose up the ranks.  His aggressive climb up the scoring ladder was stunted as he dealt with major injuries to his Achilles tendon and knee that limited him to six games last season. He has returned this season as ferocious as ever, but has struggled with efficiency while shooting a ghastly 38.7 percent.</p><br />               <p>Moving any further up the list will be a challenge. Malone (36,928) is more than 4,500 points ahead of the 36-year-old Bryant for second place and Abdul-Jabbar (38,387) is on top of the mountain by a healthy margin.</p><br />               <p>If Bryant couldn't surpass Jordan at home, and he couldn't do it against the long-time rival Celtics in Boston, what better place than Minneapolis, the birth place of the Lakers franchise. The famed  Laker Nation  is as strong here as it is in any road venue, with thousands of fans wearing purple and gold every time they come through town.</p><br />               <p>Bryant's first career game came against the Timberwolves as an 18-year-old in 1996, when he went scoreless in six minutes.</p><br />               <p>The vast majority of the fans who come to Target Center in Lakers gear weren't around when uprooted and moved to Los Angeles after the 1959-60 season. They come not to see a team that brought five championships to the city between 1948 and 1954.</p><br />               <p>They come to see Kobe, and he gave them all a little history to remember on Sunday night.</p><br />               <p> I think it puts him in the conversation of who is the greatest,  Lakers coach Byron Scott said.  I think his name's going to be mentioned when it's all said and done. His goal is still to win another championship or two, so we'll have to wait until the book is completed, but as I said at the beginning of the season, he still has a lot left in the tank. </p> "	"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 19:53:34 -0500"	"sports"
"New PBS Special 'Extreme Realities' Explores Security Threat From Climate Change"	"What kind of new realities will climate change bring this century? The latest episode in the PBS series  <a href= http://www.pbs.org/journeytoplanetearth/home/  target= _hplink >Journey to Planet Earth</a>  explores the rising threat of extreme weather and the effects climate change is already having on the geopolitical landscape around the world.<br /> <br /> Narrated by Matt Damon,  Extreme Realities: Severe Weather, Climate Change and Our National Security  also features  World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, former EPA Administrator Carol Browner, journalist Thomas Friedman and others.<br /> <br /> In the clip above, viewers are introduced to the rising tensions on the border between Bangladesh and India.

Climate change, along with economic hardship and other factors, may force an even greater number of Bangladeshis to seek refuge in India. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this problem isn't limited to the region. It would be  perhaps possible for the international community to deal with  this if it were an isolated incident, Former Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell explains in the video.

"This Is The Beautiful Result Of Shocking Polaroids With 15,000 Volts"	"Once upon a time, a Brooklyn-based artist named <a href= http://phillipstearns.wordpress.com/  target= _hplink >Phillip Stearns</a> stumbled upon a collection of instant color Fujifilm. Sadly, without the requisite camera, he couldn't produce the spur-of-the-moment, four-by-five gems Polaroid fans love. Instead, he decided to just shock the hell out of the film, with around 15,000 volts from a neon transformer. Because, why not?<br /> <br /> <img alt= blue  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2382636/thumbs/o-BLUE-900.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> His clever experiment, conducted with two electrodes and a copper plate, was a success. So much so that his methods got even weirder. He introduced chemicals (bleach, window cleaner) and pantry items (salt, baking soda) to this electric process, eventually adding in pigments and silver halide. All of these elements blend with light during the development stages to create strangely celestial portraits. He has some control over the images that burst forth, he explained in an <a href= http://motherboard.vice.com/read/high-voltage-how-to-take-psychedelic-fractal-photos-with-lightning  target= _hplink >interview with Motherboard</a>, but the rest is left up to chemical spontaneity. <br /> <br />  These treatments approach the film technology as a recording media, capable of creating images from physical, electrical, and chemical transformations,  Stearns wrote on his past <a href= https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phillipstearns/high-voltage-image-making  target= _hplink >Kickstarter page</a>. There he also cites artists like Man Ray, Pierre Cordier, Marco Breuer, Chris McCaw and Hiroshi Sugimoto as inspiration. It's true, his wild landscapes combine aspects of photograms and chemigrams, producing bursts of color that look at times like a blurry Basquiat painting or a rainbow neuron explosion. <br /> <br /> Stearns' show  <a href= http://transfergallery.com/exhibitions/2014/11/evident-material/  target= _hplink >Evident Material</a>  closes this week at New York's Transfer Gallery.

"Book Gift Guide 2014"	"The holidays are inching ever closer, and you still haven't finished your gift shopping! (Don't lie; we can see you.) Books make the perfect gift in many ways, most practically in that you can enter a Barnes & Noble and leave with your entire shopping list completed within an hour, if you really try. There's a book for nearly everyone, and until the local bookstore closes on Christmas Eve, it's never too late to find the perfect one to put under the tree for your aunt/brother/sister's boyfriend of three months who is staying for the holidays for some reason. <br /> <br /> Of course, books can be a risky gift, <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/08/the-best-nonbook-gifts_n_6271288.html?utm_hp_ref=books  target= _hplink >as we've noted in the past</a> -- for a prolific reader, the concern that the giftee may already have the book looms large; for the reading-averse, the carefully chosen book may languish forgotten under their bed forever.

"Beads Found In Danish Grave Linked To King Tut's Death Mask"	"After taking a new look at a pair of ancient cobalt beads, archaeologists now believe these Bronze Age artifacts may have been manufactured in the <a href= http://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/glass-beads-link-king-tutankhamun-and-bronze-age-nordic-women-002450  target= _hplink >same workshop as the blue glass on King Tut’s death mask</a>.<br /> <br /> If that’s the case, an extensive trade network likely ran from ancient Denmark to Egypt and Mesopotamia around 3,400 years ago, the researchers say.<br /> <br /> For the research, an international team of Danish and French archaeologists used a technique called plasma-mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical composition of 23 glass beads dating back to between 1400 and 1100 B.C. The set of <a href= http://sciencenordic.com/danish-bronze-age-glass-beads-traced-egypt  target= _hplink >beads was unearthed from Danish graves</a> in the late 19th century. <br /> <br /> The analysis revealed that two cobalt beads in the set contained the same trace elements as glass made in Egypt around the same time, which suggests they came from the same region. In fact, the researchers say the new discovery is the first Egyptian cobalt glass that has been found outside the Mediterranean area.<br /> <br /> <img alt= king tut bead  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2391168/thumbs/o-KING-TUT-BEAD-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <em>A grave excavated in 1880. Next to the woman's left arm was a blue glass bead (from Egypt), two amber beads, and two small bronze spirals.</em><br /> <br /> According to Jeanette Varberg, curator at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark who participated in the research, it’s “highly probable” the beads came from the same workshop as the death mask’s glass. But until researchers conduct a similar  chemical analysis of the glass in the mask we cannot be absolutely sure,” she told The Huffington Post in an email. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the beads' connection to King Tut, Varberg said the discovery reveals new information about ancient trade routes.<br /> <br /> “It is a significant research result with broad impact on history that will change our perceptions of how far the commodities of Egypt and Mesopotamia travelled in the 2nd millennium B.C.,” Varberg said in the email. “The movement of people, trade goods and initial ideas were much more essential in the past than we thought.”<br /> <br /> The research was <a href= http://www.skalk.dk/  target= _hplink >published in the October issue of the Danish journal</a> SKALK.

"How Being An Extravert May Give Your Immune System A Boost"	"Sure, you've probably heard that your personality is linked to many things -- from <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/night-owl-morning-person-asapscience_n_6236918.html  target= _hplink >your sleep schedule</a> even to <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/03/personality-psychology_n_6254974.html  target= _hplink >your longevity</a>. And now, researchers say your personality may even play a role in your ability to ward off infection.<br /> <br /> According to a new study, key personality traits--like being extraverted and conscientious--are intimately connected to the strength of your immune system.<br /> <br /> For the study, an ethnically diverse group of 121 healthy men and women was asked to complete a personality test to determine whether they were  extraverts  or  introverts,  and how conscientious they were. <br /> <br /> The subjects also provided researchers with blood samples so that two groups of genes that regulate the immune system could be examined: one involving the body's pro-inflammatory immune response, and another involving antiviral responses and antibodies.  <br /> <br /> What did the researchers find? <br /> <br /> The  extraverts  in the group were significantly associated with an increase in the expression of the genes that regulate the body's pro-inflammatory response, while  conscientiousness  was linked to a reduced expression of those genes -- so the  extraverts  appeared to have immune systems that seemed better able to respond to infection.<br /> <br />  In other words, individuals who we would expect to be exposed to more infections as a result of their <a href= http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2014/december/study-sheds-new-light-on-relationship-between-personality-and-health.aspx  target= _hplink >socially orientated nature (i.e., extraverts) appear to have immune systems</a> that we would expect can deal effectively with infection. While individuals who may be less exposed to infections because of their cautious/conscientious dispositions have immune systems that may respond less well,  Dr. Kavita Vedhara, a health psychologist at The University of Nottingham’s School of Medicine in England, said in a written statement.  We can’t, however, say which came first. Is this our biology determining our psychology or our psychology determining our biology?”<br /> <br /> This new study was published online in <a href= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453014004168  target= _hplink >the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology</a> on November 11, 2014.<br /> <br /> <strong><em>What else does your personality say about you?

Thus, overall, the comet would look rather gray to the human eye, as seen here. <br /> <br /> If there was any ice on the surface, the comet would have some blue spots. But ESA says the comet is covered in a dark dust, and that one of the spacecraft's upcoming missions will include trying to determine just what that dust is made of by using other combinations of the 25 OSIRIS filters.

"The Best Way To Handle Your Family Dysfunction (VIDEO)"	"For many of us, our most dysfunctional relationships are with the people we love most, our family members.  Progressive spiritual leader Rob Bell, bestselling author of <em>Love Wins,</em> discusses how to handle the destructive skeletons hiding in your family's closet in this exclusive clip from the premiere of  The Rob Bell Show  on OWN.<br /> <br />  Families always have a bunch of rules about how things are operated,  Bell says.  But here's the problem with families: no one ever writes the rules down. Correct? So all we know is there's a bunch of rules about what we can say and what we can't say, what's permissible and what's not. But no one ever wrote down how the thing works. <br /> <br /> As a kid, you just pick up on these unspoken rules, he says. But as an adult, you may no longer agree.  This is my blood, this is my tribe, this is my family -- yeah, but they're all crazy,  Bell says.  I love them, but there is dysfunction. <br /> <br /> Once you recognize that you're in an unhealthy situation, Bell says it's time to start creating boundaries.  And what's really hard sometimes for people is to hold in one hand, 'these are my family, this is my tribe, I love them,' but there's also toxic, destructive things here that I can't participate in.  The key, he says, is to balance both.<br /> <br /> So this holiday season, when you're find yourself smack in the middle of family drama, remember: you can love your family while keeping your distance, too. <br /> <em><br /> <a href= http://www.oprah.com/app/the-rob-bell-show.html  target= _hplink > The Rob Bell Show </a> airs Sunday, Dec. 21 at 8 p.m. ET on <a href= http://www.oprah.com/channel_finder.html  target= _hplink >OWN</a>.</em><br /> <br /> <style type= text/css >@media only screen and (min-width : 500px) {.ethanmobile { display: none; }<br /> }</style><br /> <br /> <center><a href= https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostOWN ><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/FBLOGO_0.png ></a> <a href= https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostOWN  target= _hplink >Like Us On Facebook</a> | <br class= ethanmobile  /> <a href= https://twitter.com/HuffPostOWN ><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/TWITTERBIRD.png ></a> <a href= https://twitter.com/HuffPostOWN  target= _hplink >Follow Us On Twitter</a></center><br />  "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 10:50:08 -0500"	"religion"
"Are Christian Podcasts Replacing Church?"	"In 1921, Scientific American published a story titled “A New Era in Wireless,” reporting that radio was no longer just for experts and tinkerers, but had spread to the masses. In Pittsburgh, the magazine reported, Calvary Episcopal Church was broadcasting a full church service every Sunday. “Think what this means to many people: the invalid, unable to go to church can enjoy its benefits without leaving his bed or wheel chair; the farmer, too far from town to go to church has the service brought to him; and the sick in the hospital are encouraged to get well by the wonderful words of the preacher,” the reporter gushed. “One can almost imagine being in church.”<br /> <br /> Today, Christians who want to “imagine being in church” have more options than ever. In particular, they have podcasts. Whatever your theology, your denomination, your interests, or your appetite for cursing, there’s a Christian podcast for you in 2014.

"Do Bacteria Go to Heaven?"	"<center>Pope Francis has hinted that all creatures go to heaven.<br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-15-popelamb717x450.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-15-popelamb717x450.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-15-popelamb717x450-thumb.jpg  width= 470  height= 294  /></a></center><br /> <br />  The Holy Scriptures teach us that the realization of this wonderful plan covers all that is around us, and that came out of the thought and the heart of God,  Pope Francis said, as quoted by Italian news site Resapubblica. The Pope added that  heaven is open to all creatures...  <br />  <br /> Pet owners are rejoicing, and indeed even a nonbeliever like me finds it charming. Still, I worry:  does His Holiness include bacteria?<br /> <br /> He had better, because bacteria are part of who we are -- a big part. The microbiome within us makes our survival possible. There are roughly 10 times as many bacteria as human cells in each of us, and without them we could not digest our food or ward off deadly invaders.<br /> <br /> But we've <a href= http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2014/08/116526/do-gut-bacteria-rule-our-minds  target= _hplink >recently discovered</a> that they are not just passive partners. Bacteria influence our minds. They actively guide our appetites and food choices. Without them, we might just sit around in heaven joylessly munching on cardboard.<br /> <br /> But we would have to anyway, if animals didn't go to heaven, where would we get our steaks, and pot roasts and hamburgers, for heaven's sake? Even if all humans in heaven went vegetarian -- which would make a lot of us Americans miserable -- dogs don't have that choice. Kittens, either. They're carnivores; they're not  designed  to run on soy patties and wheatgrass. <br /> <br /> Then again, if we're going to have any plants in heaven, it's absolutely vital to have bacteria. Without them, <a href= http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_a/A129/  target= _hplink >plants can't make use of nitrogen</a>, and without nitrogen none of us can make the proteins we rely on for life.<br /> <br /> Come to think of it, though, the entire web of life, from bacteria to megafauna, ourselves included, depends on everything else. So, along with puppies and kittens in heaven, we'll have to put up with mosquitoes, flies, ticks, and cockroaches; snakes, rats, and bats; sharks, jellyfish, and piranhas; and worst of all, Fox News commentators.<br /> <br /> But if all of creation goes to heaven, what's the difference? Suffering will abound, just as it does on Earth. Either the fox will terrorize the henhouse and take home a chicken dinner for its offspring, or it will fail and the baby foxes will starve. People would either be disgruntled vegetarians, (excepting those who already are), or pigs, chickens, and cows would continue to be force-fed and then slaughtered. Meantime, plants would continue <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3493419/  target= _hplink >their never-ending war</a> against one another and the animals that feed on them. <br /> <br /> Of course, some would say that only the souls of creatures go to heaven, leaving all that's venal, carnal, or mundane behind. At first blush, that's an attractive idea. Unfortunately, the concept of a soul as the metaphysical, permanent self driving the body is both incoherent and contrary to observable facts. <br /> <br /> It is incoherent in the sense that if you take away everything bodily, you are left with a blank sheet, a Caspar-the-Ghost without even Caspar's milquetoast personality. The notion of a permanent soul is contradicted by experience. None of us is unchanging, or even consistent. Some of us, <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_Murdoch  target= _hplink >like novelist Iris Murdoch</a>, are brilliant early in life and end our days in the blank fog of dementia. Some, <a href= http://www.history.co.uk/biographies/andrew-carnegie  target= _hplink >like Robber Baron Andrew Carnegie</a>, start out in life as ruthless predators become philanthropists. When is the  real  self?<br /> <br /> We're a tangle of rolling contradictions, whose behavior is hard to predict except in relation to the most worldly of instincts. Consider just the Bill of Wrongs: Bill Bennett, Bill Clinton, and Bill Cosby. (Next up, Bing Crosby.)<br /> <br /> In truth, whether there are plants, animals, or microbes in heaven doesn't worry me. As an atheist and humanist, I haven't the least expectation of an afterlife, and that leaves me free to try to be the best person I can in the limited time I've got.

"How One Jewish Environmental Activist Found Inspiration In The Hanukkah Miracle"	"The Hanukkah story is an account of a religious miracle, but in it lies another important message -- one that is inspiring some Jewish activists in their work for the environment.<br /> <br /> Liya Rechtman, an Eisendrath Legislative Assistant at the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, is using the Jewish month of Kislev, which runs  Nov. 23 - Dec. 22, to do a  <a href= http://www.reformjudaism.org/blog/2014/12/03/green-kislev-hanukkah-conservation-challenge?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=Rechtman&utm_campaign=Hanukkah  target= _hplink >Hanukkah Conservation Challenge</a>,  during which she will replace all of her incandescent light bulbs with energy efficient compact fluorescent bulbs. <br /> <br /> The challenge is light-specific to highlight the miracle at the core of the <a href= http://www.jewishhistory.org/the-miracle-of-chanukah/  target= _hplink >Hanukkah story</a>. After years of battle between the Jewish Maccabees and the Syrian-Greek army, the Maccabees finally defeated the last fortress and returned to the Second Temple in Jerusalem. They had only enough oil to light the temple for one day -- but it miraculously lasted for eight.<br /> <br /> Rechtman <a href= http://www.reformjudaism.org/blog/2014/12/03/green-kislev-hanukkah-conservation-challenge?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=Rechtman&utm_campaign=Hanukkah  target= _hplink >writes</a> in an article about her conservation challenge:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>Hanukkah, which begins on 25 Kislev, puts light at the core of our celebration, reminding us on cold and dark winter days how integral light is in our Jewish tradition. By replacing our light bulbs, we can minimize the damage done to our earth when we use unnecessary energy to light our homes and uphold our Jewish obligation not to destroy our earth and not to waste its resources, bal taslich (Deuteronomy 20:19).</blockquote><br /> <br /> HuffPost Religion spoke with Rechtman to hear more about the Hanukkah Conservation Challenge and how others can get involved:<br /> <br /> <strong>What inspired you to take on this challenge?</strong><br />  <br /> We were inspired to create the Monthly Green Challenge this year because it’s important to realize the ways that by slightly altering your lifestyle and daily routines one person can make a real impact on energy conservation. Our hope for the series is that others will join the challenge! So far I’ve gotten positive feedback from several readers.<br />  <br /> <strong>How can the Hanukkah miracle translate into conservation work for Jews today?</strong><br />  <br /> The celebration of Hanukah connects well to themes of conservation. In the Hanukah story, the Maccabees have oil only enough for one day and are miraculously able to make it last for eight days. As helpful as a miraculous solution to the challenges of climate change would be, we can create our own miracle by reducing our use of non-renewable energy sources, specifically oil.  We need to increase our usage of wind, solar and other cleaner energies if we are to save ourselves from the devastation of the climate change crisis.  <br />  <br /> <strong>Have you seen any synagogues or Jewish group taking on this challenge or doing other environmental work?</strong> <br />  <br /> Many Reform Jewish synagogues and affiliated organizations, like our summer camps and youth groups, are doing environmental work. The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism is partnering with an organization called GreenFaith to support our congregations in doing energy audits, making congregational spaces more energy efficient, and educating our community on environmental issues through worship services and programming. Some, like Temple Jeremiah in Chicago, are working on GreenFaith certification right now. In Boise Idaho, Congregation Ahavat Beth Israel runs a community garden for the local refugee congregations. Community gardens have become very popular among our congregations and summer camps, many of them donate the food they grow, working to protect the vulnerable within their communities at the same time that they are working to protect the earth.<br /> <br /> <strong>What stories, lessons or rhetoric do they use to inspire their congregations?</strong><br />  <br /> Congregations talk about environmental issues and Jewish values through a couple of different lenses. One of our central values is to pass on our tradition from one generation to another, from parents to children. In our text this is call l’dor v’dor, from one generation to the next. In the same way that we are taught to pass on our tradition, we also believe that we must pass on a heritable, viable earth to the next generation. We also often talk about the command to be environmental stewards, citing genesis 2:15, in which God tells Adam to “till and tend” the Garden of Eden. In the same way that Adam is commanded to till and tend the earth, we believe in protecting our earth.<br />  <br /> <strong>Will you continue the challenge beyond this month?</strong><br />  <br /> The Monthly Green Challenge is actually something I have been writing every month, with challenges specifically related to that month. I wrote one for the month of Tishrei about recycling grocery bags (<a href= http://blogs.rj.org/rac/2014/09/29/green-tishrei-challenge-byo-grocery-bags/  target= _hplink >here</a>) and one in Cheshvan about turning down your thermostat (<a href= http://blogs.rj.org/rac/2014/11/05/green-cheshvan-challenge-turn-down-your-thermostat/  target= _hplink >here</a>). So yes, the challenges will definitely continue past Kislev throughout the Jewish year!

"Black Churches Pray In Protest Of Police Brutality"	"NEW YORK (AP) — Congregants in African-American churches across the country wore black to Sunday services and prayed over the men in attendance in a symbolic stand against fatal police shootings of unarmed black men.<br /> <br /> Bishop T.D. Jakes told worshippers at The Potter's House Church in Dallas that black men should not be  tried on the sidewalk.  At Ebenezer AME Church in Fort Washington, Maryland, choir members sang  We Shall Overcome  for worshippers wearing T-shirts that read  Black Lives Matter  and  I Can't Breathe.  Men at the West Angeles Church of God in Christ in Los Angeles stood more than four rows deep around the altar for a special blessing and message from the pastor, Presiding Bishop Charles E. Blake.  Police forces are charged with protecting all our citizens,  said Blake, leader of the national Church of God in Christ, the largest black Pentecostal group in the U.S.  In a very special way, they are to abide by the laws they are called to enforce. They should not bring fear to our citizens, but rather confidence. <br /> <br /> The churches were responding to a call from several historically African-American denominations for what they called  Black Lives Matter  Sunday, in response to the recent police slayings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York. The church actions came a day after marches and demonstrations by civil rights and other groups around the country pressing for changes to the criminal justice system.<br /> <br />  It is a time to hear God calling us to be relevant and responsive to the needs of people with us and around us,  wrote Senior Bishop Lawrence Reddick of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, an organizer of Sunday's church action.<br /> <br /> At morning services, the Rev. Lee P. Washington, pastor at Reid Temple AME Church in Glenn Dale, Maryland, called black clothing  serious dress for serious times.  He said those who contend that the black men who were killed by officers  deserve what they got  for disobeying police, or whose deaths were nothing more than an  unfortunate tragedy,  should think about the impact of the deaths on grieving families.<br /> <br />  In our minds, black lives do matter,  Washington said.<br /> <br /> Several pastors sought blessings for law enforcement officials and noted many do their jobs with integrity, but they said officers guilty of wrongdoing should be held accountable.

"Court Reconsiders Removal Of 'Innocence of Muslims,' Anti-Islam, Film On YouTube"	"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal appeals court will reconsider a decision to order YouTube to take down an anti-Muslim film clip that sparked violence in the Middle East and death threats to the actors from those who considered it blasphemous to the Prophet Muhammad.<br /> <br /> An 11-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena will hear arguments Monday by Google, which owns YouTube, disputing the court's decision to remove  Innocence of Muslims  from the popular video sharing service. A divided three-judge panel ruled in February that actress Cindy Lee Garcia had a copyright claim to the 2012 video because she believed she was acting in a much different production than the one that appeared.<br /> <br /> Garcia was paid $500 for a movie called  Desert Warrior  she believed had nothing to do with religion, but ended up in a five-second scene in which her voice was dubbed over so her character asked if Muhammad was a child molester.<br /> <br />  These, of course, are fighting words to many faithful Muslims and, after the film aired on Egyptian television, there were protests that generated worldwide news coverage,  Judge Alex Kozinski wrote in the 2-1 opinion.  While answering a casting call for a low-budget amateur film doesn't often lead to stardom, it also rarely turns an aspiring actress into the subject of a fatwa. <br /> <br /> Google argued that the copyright was owned by filmmaker Mark Basseley Youssef, who wrote the script, managed the production and dubbed over Garcia's dialogue.<br /> <br /> A dissenting judge said Garcia played no creative role that would give her ownership rights.<br /> <br /> Until the court order, YouTube had rejected calls by President Barack Obama and other world leaders to pull the video, arguing that it would amount to government censorship and violate free speech protections.<br /> <br /> Google is supported in its appeal by an unusual alliance that includes filmmakers, Internet rivals such as Yahoo and prominent news media companies such as The New York Times that don't want the court to infringe on First Amendment rights.<br /> <br /> Garcia has support from the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Musicians.<br /> <br /> If the court upholds the smaller panel's ruling, YouTube and other Internet companies could face takedown notices from others in minor video roles.<br /> <br /> Alex Lawrence, a copyright and intellectual property lawyer in New York not connected with the case, said he thinks the court will reverse the earlier ruling because the judges reached a decision to give Garcia some relief on thinly grounded law.<br /> <br />  There's a lot of sympathy for Miss Garcia,  Lawrence said.  She got paid $500 and received death threats. Everyone feels sympathy for her, but using copyright in this way is a real problem for a lot of industries. <br /> <br /> The film drew the attention of federal prosecutors, who discovered that Youssef had used several false names in violation of probation from a 2010 check fraud case. He was sent back to prison in 2012 and was released on probation in September 2013."	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 09:17:29 -0500"	"religion"

"On Being Asked to Change 'Black Lives Matter' to 'All Lives Matter'"	"As a<a href= http://buxmontuu.org/  target= _hplink > Unitarian Universalist</a> minister, it is sometimes my role to answer correspondence that comes to our congregation from members of the community.  Last night, I received this brief note in my inbox:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>Good Evening:<br /> <br /> I am very upset at the signage that is outside of your church stating that  Black Lives Matter.  Since when has God chosen to see us by the color of our skin. The sign should be taken down and replaced with ALL LIVES MATTER. How will this nation of ours ever join together if we are constantly looking at everyone by their race. Unless you were actually there in Ferguson or in New York or Cleveland, you do not have all the facts.<br /> <br /> A Bucks County Resident</blockquote><br /> <br /> It's a sentiment I'd heard before, and I gave a great deal of thought before sending the following response:<br /> <br />  Dear [name],<br /> <br /> Thank you for writing with your concern. Of course all lives matter. Central to Unitarian Universalism is the affirmation of the inherent worth and dignity of every person. Sadly, our society has a long history of treating some people as less valuable than others. Study after study has confirmed that in equivalent situations, African Americans and Latinos are treated with deadly force far more often than White people, and authorities held less accountable. Unfortunately, racial bias continues to exist even when it is no longer conscious -- this too is confirmed by multiple studies. A lack of accountability in the use of force combined with unconscious bias is too often a deadly combination -- and one that could place police officers, as well as the public, in great danger.<br /> <br /> To say that Black lives matter is not to say that other lives do not; indeed, it is quite the reverse -- it is to recognize that all lives do matter, and to acknowledge that African Americans are often targeted unfairly (witness the number of African Americans accosted daily for no reason other than walking through a White neighborhood -- including some, like young Trayvon Martin, who lost their lives) and that our society is not yet so advanced as to have become truly color blind. This means that many people of goodwill face the hard task of recognizing that these societal ills continue to exist, and that White privilege continues to exist, even though we wish it didn't and would not have asked for it. I certainly agree that no loving God would judge anyone by skin color.<br /> <br /> As a White man, I have never been followed by security in a department store, or been stopped by police for driving through a neighborhood in which I didn't live. My African American friends have, almost to a person, had these experiences. Some have been through incidents that were far worse. I owe it to the ideal that we share, the ideal that all lives matter, to take their experiences seriously and listen to what they are saying. To deny the truth of these experiences because they make me uncomfortable would be to place my comfort above the safety of others, and I cannot do that.<br /> <br /> I very much appreciate you writing to me, and am glad that we share the goal of coming to a day when people will not be judged, consciously or unconsciously, on the basis of their race. I believe that day is possible, too, but that it will take a great deal of work to get there. That work begins by listening to one another, and listening especially to the voices of those who have the least power in society. If nothing else is clear from the past few weeks, it is painfully evident that a great many people do not believe that they are treated fairly. Healing begins by listening to those voices and stories.<br /> <br /> Thank you again for writing me.<br /> <br /> In faith,<br /> Rev. Dan Schatz, Minister<br /> BuxMont Unitarian Universalist Fellowship <br /> <br /> <em>This post originally appeared on <a href= http://songandthesigh.com/2014/12/04/on-being-asked-to-change-black-lives-matter-to-all-lives-matter/  target= _hplink >The Song and the Sigh</a>.</em> "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 08:50:09 -0500"	"religion"

"The Most Racist Thing About Serial Podcast: Mail Kimp"	"I, like many people, have become completely obsessed with <em>Serial</em>, however, there is one thing about the podcast that always makes me cringe. It's not the way the podcast deals with race, how Sarah Koening's white privilege creeps in, or the way she perpetuates the myth of the model minority, as scrutinized in <a href= http://www.salon.com/2014/11/17/from_the_greatest_podcast_ever_made_to_shamelessly_exploitative_an_introduction_to_the_serial_backlash/  target= _hplink >other blogs</a>. In fact, I love the podcast and eagerly await this week's final episode. The part about <em>Serial</em> that bothers me most is the advertisement for <a href= http://mailchimp.com/  target= _hplink >Mail Chimp</a> that airs at the beginning of every episode. <br /> <br /> According to what I read <a href= http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/now-nprs-serial-podcast-runaway-hit-mailchimp-reaping-rewards-161642  target= _hplink >online</a>, Serial reporter Dana Chavvis is asking people on the street to say  Mail Chimp , the name of an email mailing service. The third person stumbles, mispronounces  chimp , saying  kimp  and then finally says  chimp . I cringed the first time I heard it. Maybe I'm more attuned to this because I am Korean American and I have grown up hearing people with strong Korean accents. I am 95 person sure the person is an Asian female who does not speak English as her first language. I do not think the person is a child, as proposed on <a href= http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2lhg5b/new_evidence_mail_kimp/  target= _hplink >reddit</a> or on <a href= http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/now-nprs-serial-podcast-runaway-hit-mailchimp-reaping-rewards-161642  target= _hplink >Adweek</a>. Neither did the people I played it for today. If I'm wrong, I'll be the first to apologize.<br /> <br />  Mail Kimp  has caught on, as many things online have, and morphed into it's own thing. It has it's own hashtag and it's become a <a href= http://www.wired.com/2014/11/wtf-is-mailkimp-meme/  target= _hplink >joke</a> between <em>Serial</em> listeners. Mail Kimp even has it's own <a href= https://twitter.com/MailKimp  target= _hplink >twitter</a>, <a href= http://www.tumblr.com/search/mail+kimp  target= _hplink >tumblr</a> and a catchy <a href= https://soundcloud.com/kpffkl/mail-kimp-remix#t=1:06  target= _hplink >Soundcloud</a> remix that makes me want jam for a second until I realize I feel sick. And, if you go to <a href= http://mailkimp.com  target= _hplink >www.mailkimp.com</a> you're redirected to Mail Chimp.<br /> <br /> In fact just today, we were discussing the benefits of using Mail Chimp in regard to our organization, the <a href= http://ensj.weebly.com/  target= _hplink >Educators' Network for Social Justice</a>, email blasts and I started to feel my palms get sweaty and my heart beat faster. Anxious anxiety was boiling up inside me. It's a reaction that I only feel when something really racist has happened to me, akin to Bell Hook's  killing rage .<br /> <br /> Why did Mail Chimp decide to use this audio byte of the woman mispronouncing their name? I guess maybe they thought it was cute or endearing. I find it completely offensive and when I hear it I have a visceral reaction. I can't talk about <em>Serial</em> without mentioning the way the advertisement makes me feel. In fact, now that the advertisement has played 11 times (once for each episode) I cannot disassociate the company with the offensive audio byte, which is why I reacted the way I did during the discussion about Mail Chimp at my meeting. <br /> <br /> I don't find anything cute about second language learners mispronouncing words, and the fact that so many people are giggling, laughing, or just plain making fun of this Asian woman. It is troubling. What does it say about people? It's okay to make fun of people who don't speak English as their first language? How old are we? Why hasn't anyone else written about this online yet? Am I really the only person who thought this was an obvious racist <a href= http://www.microaggressions.com/  target= _hplink >microaggression</a>?

"Farewell, Colbert Nation (And Why Is Conservative Comedy Still Unfunny?)"	"After nine years at the helm of <em>The Colbert Report</em>, where he turned his brilliant right-wing persona into a sprawling marketing empire (see your grocery's freezer section), <a href= http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/06/02/colbert-report-taught-viewers-more-about-super-pacs-than-cable-news  target= _hplink >explained</a> super PACs to everyday Americans, enlightened us about divinity, and added   <a href= http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/09/truthiness_research_cognitive_biases_for_simple_clear_conservative_messages.html  target= _hplink >truthiness</a>  to the nation's vocabulary, Stephen Colbert says his farewell to the Colbert Nation this week to become CBS's new <em>Late Night</em> host. (Sans persona.)<br /> <br /> For nearly ten years and more than 1,400 episodes, Colbert remained a constantly amusing and insightful part of our national dialogue.  Fans of the show and its indomitable host (only now defeated by the real-life lure of late-night respectability) have good reason to mourn,  noted <em>The New Yorker</em> earlier this year, while <em>Salon</em> recently crowned Colbert  one of the most important figures in U.S. political comedy of all time. <br /> <br /> By embracing the absurd and truly embodying it, Colbert has made politics and public policy uproariously funny, while providing much-needed bouts of sanity for devoted news junkies.<br /> <br /> His satirical voice won't be gone completely, of course. Colbert's late-night colleague Jon Stewart continues to soldier on with <em>The Daily Show</em>, that show's alumni John Oliver is doing fine work at HBO, while another, Larry Wilmore, readies his turn to take over Colbert's late-night Comedy Central slot.<br /> <br /> But there's no denying Colbert's exit from Comedy Central marks a cultural and political milestone of sorts. The exit is disheartening not only because the genuine laughs will be missed, but because Colbert's satirical work has been instrumental in spearheading progressive arguments and critiques for years.<br /> <br /> Colbert's departure also reminds us how hollow <a href= http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/conservative-comedians-2014-5/#print  target= _hplink >conservative comedic efforts</a> have been, as they fail to play catch-up in the cultural war of political satire. Humor remains a rhetorical weapon that American conservatives simply cannot harness.<br /> <br /> Maybe that's because political comedy usually doesn't work well when it's anchored in seething hatred or even casual contempt, the type that conservatives hold for President Obama. Political satire works best when it's fueled by curiosity, bewilderment, annoyance, and with a dash of self-righteousness mixed in. And for nine years, Colbert has been deftly mixing that cocktail on The Colbert Report.<br /> <br /> Indeed, over the last decade Stewart and Colbert emerged as the Mantle and Maris of political satire, revolutionizing the way viewers, especially young ones, consume news. They're two giants whose staffs added DVRs to the liberal arsenal, catching their favorite target, Fox News, in an array of uproarious bouts of <a href= http://www.alternet.org/media/watch-stephen-colbert-skewers-fox-blatant-benghazi-hypocrisy  target= _hplink >hypocrisy</a>, while puncturing their endless bouts of Obama Derangement Syndrome.<br /> <br /> Colbert once described his character as a  well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot.  One reason the on-air Colbert has resonated nationwide, of course, is that Fox News is currently filled with closed-minded millionaire hosts who perfectly mirror the buffoonery Colbert projects every week. Colbert has been blessed with cable news doppelgangers (Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Steve Doocy, etc.) who make The Colbert Report laughs entirely authentic. And for liberals, they're who make the guffaws all the more appreciated. (i.e. If you don't laugh, you'll cry.)  <br /> <br /> It was just over a decade ago that the laughs arrived, and just in time. That's when Stewart's incarnation of The Daily Show helped restore bits of progressive sanity, especially in 2002 and 2003, as America launched its misguided invasion of Iraq. At a time when so much of the Beltway press <a href= http://www.salon.com/2006/05/04/lapdogs/  target= _hplink >laid down for the Bush administration</a>, Stewart pushed back. And he got big laughs. Yes he was on basic cable, and no he didn't have an especially large national following at the time. But this was obviously prior to the advent of Facebook, Twitter and the explosion of social media. Back then, Stewart, with Colbert later at his side, proved to be a pioneer.<br /> <br /> This was a time when there were very few high-profile media voices that progressives could point to and say, 'That's exactly how I feel about the war and about the mainstream media's utter capitulation to the Republican war culture.'<br /> <br /> Against all odds, late-night Comedy Central became that voice.<br /> <br /> If you've forgotten how oppressive the Bush era was in terms Beltway media critiques, simply recall Colbert's star-making turn as the featured performer at the 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner. Holding court just a few feet away from Bush and before a sea of assembled journalists, Colbert skewered both targets with gleeful abandon; the satire layered on thick.<br /> <br />  Over the last five years, you people were so good -- over tax cuts, WMD intelligence, the effect of global warming. We Americans didn't want to know, and you had the courtesy not to try to find out,  chided Colbert.<br /> <br /> Then he lowered the boom:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>    Here's how it works: The president makes decisions. He's the decider. The press secretary announces those decisions, and you people of the press type those decisions down. Make, announce, type. Just put 'em through a spell check and go home. Get to know your family again. Make love to your wife. Write that novel you got kicking around in your head. You know, the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration. You know--fiction!</blockquote><br /> <br /> The media response to the epic truth-telling? First they mostly ignored him. Then they said he just wasn't funny.<br /> <br /> The <em>Washington Post</em>, the longtime guardian of acceptable of Beltway behavior, seemed especially humorless about Colbert's now-classic performance.  The consensus is that President Bush and Bush impersonator Steve Bridges stole Saturday's show -- and Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert's cutting satire fell flat,  wrote the <em>Post's </em>Amy Argetsinger and Roxanne Roberts.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/05/03/dobbs-suggested-that-liberal-bias-kept-the-medi/135574  target= _hplink >According </a>to Dana Milbank, Colbert  wasn't terribly funny.   And<em> Post c</em>olumnist Richard Cohen was utterly aghast at how  rude  Colbert had been to Bush. It was the comedian's rudeness that utterly rendered his act  not funny  and why he   failed dismally. <br /> <br /> For the record, Cohen represented a prime example of a D.C. pundit who not only bought Bush's bogus tale of WMD's in Iraq, but who actively pushed the fabrication in his column. But I'm sure that had nothing to do with Cohen's disdain for Colbert's biting performance, right?<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, can you imagine a conservative comedian rattling the Beltway the way Colbert did at that dinner, and the way he's been doing it for nearly a decade? Neither can I. Comedy Central's satirical juggernaut must be driving conservatives to distraction, especially the ones worried about losing the larger pop culture war.<br /> <br />  The right's anger over being comically challenged is made worse by that fact that they so desperately want to be funny,  comedian Dean Obeidallah <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/13/why-the-gop-can-t-take-a-joke.html  target= _hplink >wrote</a> on Daily Beast this year, when humorless Fox News anchors spent days lamenting President Obama's very funny appearance on the Zach Galifianakis web series,  Between Two Ferns.  ( Tragic,   Gross,   Dreadful,   Unbearable  was how the unsmiling pundits lambasted Obama's extended bit.)<br /> <br /> I doubt we'll ever see a conservative comic, or one of any partisan stripes, deliver the kind of satirical brilliance and insights that Colbert has for the last decade.<br /> <br /> Nation, farewell.<br /> <br /> <em><a href= http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/12/15/farewell-colbert-nation/201881  target= _hplink >Crossposted</a> at Media Matters for America</em>.

"Artists Explore The Influence And History Of Ebony And Jet Magazines"	" Think about the fact that since the 1940s, Ebony has been published, every month, and continues to be,  explained Lauren Hayes, curator at the Studio Museum in Harlem, in an interview with The Huffington Post.  It's about taking stock of this moment, thinking about what that says and if it says anything at all, really. <br /> <br /> Hayes curated the ongoing exhibition  <a href= http://www.studiomuseum.org/exhibition/speaking-people-emebonyem-emjetem-and-contemporary-art  target= _hplink >Speaking of People: Ebony, Jet and Contemporary Art</a>,  an inter-generational, multidisciplinary look at the influence of these two long-running black publications on the consciousness of contemporary artists. <br /> <br />  <a href= http://www.artnews.com/2014/11/11/ebony-and-jet-at-the-studio-museum-in-harlem/  target= _hplink >They were the first magazines of their kind</a>,  Linda Johnson Rice, chairman of the Johnson Publishing Company, told ArtNews. The Johnson Publishing Company began publishing Ebony in November of 1945 and, after selling out their initial run in under a month, haven't stopped since. Six years later a sister publication, Jet, was added to the agenda. <br /> <br /> <img alt= jet  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386872/thumbs/o-JET-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>Godfried Donkor, Ebony Accra edition, 2014 Collage on paper 27 1⁄2 × 39 9/25 in. Courtesy the artist</small></center><br /> <br />  The magazines were born out of a need that my parents saw, that there were no magazines that really spoke to black people. Ebony wrote about architects and artists, the share cropper who sent his nine kids to college, real African Americans at a time when everyone else only covered them as entertainers and athletes. <br /> <br /> Around 70 years after the magazines' beginnings, Hayes noticed the immense impact the printed publications were having on artists of all different ages and backgrounds.  About two years ago, we noticed there were a lot of artists thinking about and using materials from the magazine, particularly around the time of an exhibition here at the museum called  <a href= http://www.studiomuseum.org/exhibition/david-hartt-stray-light  target= _hplink >The Stray Light</a>,  featuring work by photographer David Hartt, who had access to the Johnson's old publishing building.<br /> <br /> <img alt= eg  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386878/thumbs/o-EG-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>Ellen Gallagher , DeLuxe, 2004–5 Portfolio of sixty etchings with photogravure, spitbite, collage, laser-cutting, screenprint, offset lithography, hand painting and Plasticine</small></center><br /> <br />  It became what felt like a really great moment to look and explore and see how many artists -- which artists and what artists were doing with these materials. Particularly works like Ellen Gallagher's 'Delux' which is in the museum's collection and we've shown other times, but wanting to bring out this particular aspect of it.  <br /> <br /> The exhibition features work from 16 artists including Hank Willis Thomas, Godfried Donkor, Glenn Ligon, Kerry James Marshall and Martine Syms. While some created work especially for the show, all had previously explored either thematic or material elements of Ebony and Jet in some way prior to the exhibition. Some artists incorporate physical elements of the magazine into their work, while others operate on a more conceptual plane, exploring the space opened up by these two periodicals. <br /> <br /> <img alt= hw  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386888/thumbs/o-HW-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>Hank Willis Thomas, Jet People, 2010 Gouache acrylic on canvas 20 × 40 in. Courtesy the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York © Hank Willis Thomas</small></center><br /> <br /> The diversity of the artists on view speaks to the diversity of the black experience.  There's a wide range of artists working in different materials, different ways,  said Hayes.  What was really exciting to me was to have a common source material but it wasn't just, <em>Oh, all artists are in this time or this place or working in a certain material.</em> There was a range and a wide array of artists using the materials. Just the breadth that Ebony and Jet have had and continue to have. <br /> <br /> The exhibition also touches on the precarious status print media holds in the quickly digitizing culture around us. Jet stopped its print publication earlier this year.  I think this is one of those interesting moments in the conversation that happens so often around print media and magazines -- if it's dying, if everything is moving digital, what it means?  <br /> <br /> <img alt= pp  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386894/thumbs/o-PP-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>Ellen Gallagher, Hare, 2013 Ink, watercolor, oil, pencil and cut paper on paper 44 4/5 × 46 3/5 in.

"Court Reconsiders Removal Of 'Innocence of Muslims,' Anti-Islam, Film On YouTube"	"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal appeals court will reconsider a decision to order YouTube to take down an anti-Muslim film clip that sparked violence in the Middle East and death threats to the actors from those who considered it blasphemous to the Prophet Muhammad.<br /> <br /> An 11-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena will hear arguments Monday by Google, which owns YouTube, disputing the court's decision to remove  Innocence of Muslims  from the popular video sharing service. A divided three-judge panel ruled in February that actress Cindy Lee Garcia had a copyright claim to the 2012 video because she believed she was acting in a much different production than the one that appeared.<br /> <br /> Garcia was paid $500 for a movie called  Desert Warrior  she believed had nothing to do with religion, but ended up in a five-second scene in which her voice was dubbed over so her character asked if Muhammad was a child molester.<br /> <br />  These, of course, are fighting words to many faithful Muslims and, after the film aired on Egyptian television, there were protests that generated worldwide news coverage,  Judge Alex Kozinski wrote in the 2-1 opinion.  While answering a casting call for a low-budget amateur film doesn't often lead to stardom, it also rarely turns an aspiring actress into the subject of a fatwa. <br /> <br /> Google argued that the copyright was owned by filmmaker Mark Basseley Youssef, who wrote the script, managed the production and dubbed over Garcia's dialogue.<br /> <br /> A dissenting judge said Garcia played no creative role that would give her ownership rights.<br /> <br /> Until the court order, YouTube had rejected calls by President Barack Obama and other world leaders to pull the video, arguing that it would amount to government censorship and violate free speech protections.<br /> <br /> Google is supported in its appeal by an unusual alliance that includes filmmakers, Internet rivals such as Yahoo and prominent news media companies such as The New York Times that don't want the court to infringe on First Amendment rights.<br /> <br /> Garcia has support from the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Musicians.<br /> <br /> If the court upholds the smaller panel's ruling, YouTube and other Internet companies could face takedown notices from others in minor video roles.<br /> <br /> Alex Lawrence, a copyright and intellectual property lawyer in New York not connected with the case, said he thinks the court will reverse the earlier ruling because the judges reached a decision to give Garcia some relief on thinly grounded law.<br /> <br />  There's a lot of sympathy for Miss Garcia,  Lawrence said.  She got paid $500 and received death threats. Everyone feels sympathy for her, but using copyright in this way is a real problem for a lot of industries. <br /> <br /> The film drew the attention of federal prosecutors, who discovered that Youssef had used several false names in violation of probation from a 2010 check fraud case. He was sent back to prison in 2012 and was released on probation in September 2013."	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 09:17:29 -0500"	"media"
"Aaron Sorkin Slams Media In Op-Ed About Sony Hack"	"In an op-ed published by the New York Times on Sunday, <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/opinion/aaron-sorkin-journalists-shouldnt-help-the-sony-hackers.html  target= _hplink >Oscar-winning writer Aaron Sorkin slammed news outlets</a> for covering information leaked online in the wake of a massive cyber attack against Sony Pictures.<br /> <br />  As a screenwriter in Hollywood who's only two generations removed from probably being blacklisted, I'm not crazy about Americans calling other Americans un-American, so let's just say that every news outlet that did the bidding of the Guardians of Peace [the group claiming responsibility for the hack] is morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable,  Sorkin wrote.<br /> <br /> Multiple news outlets, including <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/11/sony-hack-hollywood-ignorance-diversity-_n_6310436.html  target= _hplink >The Huffington Post</a>, <a href= http://pagesix.com/2014/12/11/producer-blasts-angelina-in-hacked-sony-e-mails/  target= _hplink >The New York Post</a>, <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/12/shocking-new-reveals-from-sony-hack-j-law-pitt-clooney-and-comparing-fincher-to-hitler.html  target= _hplink >The Daily Beast</a> and <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/business/media/emails-from-hacking-reveal-sonys-dirty-laundry.html  target= _hplink >The New York Times</a> have written stories about the hacked emails.

Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended. <br /> <br /> Sorkin himself was at the center of a leaked thread about his Steve Jobs movie.

"American Torture -- Past, Present, and... Future?"	"<span style= font-size: x-large; ><strong>Beyond the Senate Torture Report</strong> </span><br /> <br /> <em><strong>Cross-posted with <a href= http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175934/  target= _hplink >TomDispatch.com</a></strong></em><br /> <br /> <p>It&rsquo;s the political story of the week in Washington. At long last,  after the endless stalling and foot-shuffling, the arguments about  redaction and <a href= http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/cia-admits-it-improperly-hacking-senate-computers-20140731 >CIA computer hacking</a>, the <a href= http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/08/cia-torture-report-senate-intelligence-committee/20087371/ >claims</a> that its release might stoke others out there in the Muslim world to violence and &ldquo;<a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/us/politics/bush-and-cia-ex-officials-rebut-torture-report.html >throw</a> the C.I.A. to the wolves,&rdquo; the report -- you know which one -- is out.&nbsp;  Or at least, the redacted executive summary of it is available to be  read and, as Senator Mark Udall <a href= http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/mark-udall-0115 >said</a> before its release, &ldquo;When this report is declassified, people will  abhor what they read. They&rsquo;re gonna be disgusted. They&rsquo;re gonna be  appalled. They&rsquo;re gonna be shocked at what we did.&rdquo;</p><br /> <p>So now we can <a href= http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/study2014/sscistudy1.pdf >finally consider</a> the partial release of the long-awaited report from the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence about the gruesome CIA interrogation methods  used during the Bush administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;Global War on Terror.&rdquo; But here&rsquo;s  one important thing to keep in mind: this report addresses only the  past practices of a single agency. Its narrow focus encourages us to  believe that, whatever the CIA may have once done, that whole sorry  torture chapter is now behind us.</p><br /> <p>In other words, the moment we get to read it, it&rsquo;s already time to turn the page. So be shocked, be disgusted, be appalled, but don&rsquo;t be fooled. The Senate torture report, so many years and obstacles in the making, should only be the starting point for a discussion, not the final word on U.S. torture. Here&rsquo;s why.</p><br /> <p>Mainstream coverage of U.S. torture in general, and of this new report in particular, rests on three false assumptions:</p><br /> <p>1. The most important question is whether torture &ldquo;worked.&rdquo;</p><br /> <p>2. U.S. torture ended when George W. Bush left office.</p><br /> <p>3. The only kind of torture that really &ldquo;counts&rdquo; happens in foreign war zones.</p><br /> <p>Let&rsquo;s look at each of these in order.</p><br /> <p><strong>False Assumption #1: The only question is &ldquo;Did it work?&rdquo;</strong></p><br /> <p>Maybe torture &ldquo;worked&rdquo; on occasion. Probably it didn&rsquo;t. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter because torture is illegal under U.S. and international law, and it&rsquo;s a moral abomination.</p><br /> <p><a href= http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199336431/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20 ><img src= http://www.tomdispatch.com/images/managed/mainstreamtorture.jpg  alt=   hspace= 6  align= left  /></a>The Senate report&rsquo;s first finding -- and the one that much of a highly predictable debate will focus on -- is that the CIA&rsquo;s &ldquo;enhanced interrogation techniques&rdquo; were &ldquo;ineffective&rdquo; in identifying the perpetrators of 9/11, producing actionable intelligence, or preventing terrorist attacks. In response, the rhetoric is already flying. The Republicans (except for <a href= http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/john-mccain-cia-report-proves-what-i-know-experience-n264806 >Senator John McCain</a>) are <a href= http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/republicans-dismiss-senate-torture-report-ahead-release >jumping up and down</a> shouting &ldquo;It <em>did</em> work! It <em>did</em>!&rdquo; The president&rsquo;s own CIA director, John Brennan, has issued his denunciation of the report. While <a href= http://www.businessinsider.com/cia-responds-to-horrifying-torture-report-2014-12 >acknowledging</a> that &ldquo;the Agency made mistakes,&rdquo; he, too, insisted that torture &ldquo;worked.&rdquo; (A couple of days later, he backtracked, suggesting instead that the answer to this question was actually  <a href= http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/12/11/370106597/do-not-publish-cia-chief-brennan-says-senate-s-torture-report-xxx >unknowable</a>. ) Other former officials of the Agency are <a href= http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/exclusive-former-cia-director-michael-hayden-torture-report-n265031 >chiming in</a> big time.</p><br /> <p>In the end, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the CIA&rsquo;s methods -- including waterboarding (which McCain <a href= http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/09/john-mccain-statement-cia-terror-report/20144015/ >calls</a> &ldquo;mock execution&rdquo; and &ldquo;an exquisite form of torture&rdquo;); inflicting week-long sleep deprivation; repeated beatings; hanging people by their wrists for days, bombarding them with unbearable sound and light or keeping them in total darkness; threatening to sexually abuse their mothers or harm their children; or, in possibly <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/senate-report-uncooperative-terrorism-suspects-faced-rectal-rehydration-feeding/2014/12/09/fcffb1ec-7fb8-11e4-8882-03cf08410beb_story.html >five cases</a>, shoving a tube up someone&rsquo;s rectum and filling it with water (supposedly for &ldquo;<a href= http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/cia-torture-report/rectal-hydration-inside-cias-interrogation-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-n265016 >rectal rehydration</a>&rdquo;) -- were effective. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether these methods led the Navy Seals to Osama bin Laden. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether these methods <a href= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2009/04/waterbored.html >prevented</a> an al-Qaeda attack on the Library Tower in Los Angeles. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they saved American (and only American!) lives. In fact, for those who read the report, the Senate committee is remarkably convincing on a subject about which we already have much information: torture notoriously does not produce useful information. It produces a tangled mess of truths, half-truths, lies, wild invention and confabulation, psychotic ravings, and desperate attempts to say whatever the victim thinks the torturers want to hear.</p><br /> <p>But none of this matters. Nor does it matter how frightened we are. The situation isn&rsquo;t complicated. We are not allowed to torture people, because we have passed laws against it and signed treaties saying we won&rsquo;t do it. The U.N. Convention Against Torture, which the U.S. signed in 1994, makes it very clear that being afraid of an attack is no excuse for torture. In Article 2, the Convention states, &ldquo;No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability, or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.&rdquo; People will always make excuses, but there is no legitimate excuse for torture.</p><br /> <p>What&rsquo;s at stake here is the kind of country we want to be: Are we a courageous nation ruled by laws or a <a href= http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175866/tomgram%3A_rebecca_gordon,_a_nation_of_cowards/ >nation of cowards</a>?</p><br /> <p><strong>False Assumption #2: Torture ended when George W. Bush left office.</strong></p><br /> <p>In his statement on the day the report was released, President Obama <a href= http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2014/12/09/obama-senate-torture-report-enhanced-interrogation-techniques/20137941/ >tried once again</a> to shove U.S. torture into a box labeled Bad Things We Used to Do. &ldquo;Rather than another reason to refight old arguments,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hope that today&rsquo;s report can help us leave these techniques where they belong: in the past.&rdquo;</p><br /> <p>In fact, institutionalized state torture is not a thing of the past. It has continued under President Obama. Here are some examples:</p><br /> <p>*Twice a day in the U.S. prison at Guant&aacute;namo, guards forcibly remove hunger strikers from their cells, strap them to a chair, and &ldquo;feed&rdquo; them through a tube jammed up the nose and down into the stomach. Here&rsquo;s how one victim <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/15/opinion/hunger-striking-at-guantanamo-bay.html?_r=0 >remembered</a> that experience:</p><br /> <p style= padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; > I will never forget the first time they passed the feeding tube up my nose. I can&rsquo;t describe how painful it is to be force-fed this way. As it was thrust in, it made me feel like throwing up. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn&rsquo;t. There was agony in my chest, throat, and stomach. I had never experienced such pain before. I would not wish this cruel punishment upon anyone. </p><br /> <p>Force-feeding is no humanitarian act; it is a punishment for nonviolent resistance. It often begins with what officials call &ldquo;cell extraction&rdquo; -- as if prisoners were teeth to be pulled out of a jaw. Here&rsquo;s what happens, <a href= http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/07/201373145723725101.html >according to Yemini prisoner</a> Moath al-Alwi, who has been at Guant&aacute;namo since 2002:</p><br /> <p style= padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; > When I choose to remain in my cell in an act of peaceful protest against the force-feeding, the prison authorities send in a Forced Cell Extraction team: six guards in full riot gear. Those guards are deliberately brutal to punish me for my protest. They pile up on top of me to the point that I feel like my back is about to break. They then carry me out and strap me into the restraint chair, which we hunger strikers call the torture chair. </p><br /> <p>Guards use the &ldquo;torture chair&rdquo; to restrain the prisoner, says al-Alwi, but also to make the procedure even more painful:</p><br /> <p style= padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; > A new twist to this routine involves the guards restraining me to the chair with my arms cuffed behind my back. The chest strap is then tightened, trapping my arms between my torso and the chair&rsquo;s backrest. This is done despite the fact that the torture chair features built-in arm restraints. It is extremely painful to remain in this position. </p><br /> <p>At present, a Navy nurse faces <a href= http://www.npr.org/2014/11/19/365271597/guantanamo-nurse-could-be-discharged-for-not-force-feeding-detainees >possible dishonorable discharge</a> for refusing to participate in these force feedings, because he believes they are a form of torture.</p><br /> <p>Why are detainees on hunger strike in the first place? They are using the only nonviolent means available to them to protest their indefinite and illegal detention, which the U.N. Committee Against Torture says is in itself a violation of U.S. duties under the U.N. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment.</p><br /> <p><strong>* </strong>It wasn&rsquo;t until this December 10th that the U.S. military <a href= http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/10/us-usa-cia-torture-bagram-idUSKBN0JO2B720141210 >finally released</a> its last detainees from the notorious Detention Facility in Parwan on Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. In September 2014, the United States &ldquo;<a href= http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/20/us-releases-14-pakistani-detainees-afghanistan >quietly released</a>&rdquo; 14 Pakistanis it had held there for some years -- none of whom was ever accused of any crime. We know nothing about the treatment of those who remained at Bagram, but we do know that, like the detainees at Guant&aacute;namo, the men being held there used hunger strikes as their only nonviolent means of resisting their indefinite detention and solitary confinement.</p><br /> <p>* In what appears to be a direct contravention of a 2009 <a href= http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations >presidential executive order</a> to the CIA to shut down all its &ldquo;black sites,&rdquo; or secret interrogation centers around the world, the Agency seems still to be operating at least one of them.<strong> </strong>Or at least it was two years later when journalist Jeremy Scahill <a href= http://www.thenation.com/article/161936/cias-secret-sites-somalia >reported</a> on a secret underground prison in Mogadishu, Somalia, run by the CIA, ostensibly in cooperation with the Somali government&rsquo;s National Security Agency. There, according to Scahill, &ldquo;U.S. intelligence personnel pay the salaries of intelligence agents and also directly interrogate prisoners.&rdquo;<strong> <br /></strong></p><br /> <p>Have these intelligence agents used &ldquo;enhanced interrogation techniques&rdquo;? We don&rsquo;t know. What we do know, however, was that the place was dark, filthy, and infested with bedbugs and mosquitoes. We know that prisoners held there had been kidnapped, hooded, and transported by plane in a style familiar to anyone who has followed the <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/03/AR2005120301476.html >CIA&rsquo;s methods</a> over the last dozen years.</p><br /> <p>If that site is still open, either the CIA is operating it with the Obama administration&rsquo;s knowledge and consent or it is defying the president of the United States. In either case, there was and possibly still is a serious breach of executive power going on.</p><br /> <p>* During his confirmation hearings, Obama&rsquo;s first CIA director, Leon Panetta, <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/us/politics/18policy.html?pagewanted=all >told</a> members of Congress that &ldquo;if the approved techniques were &lsquo;not sufficient&rsquo; to get a detainee to divulge details he was suspected of knowing about an imminent attack, he would ask for &lsquo;additional authority&rsquo; to use other methods.&rdquo;</p><br /> <p>* President Obama&rsquo;s <a href= http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations >2009 executive order</a> ending CIA torture still left open a little-discussed torture window.&nbsp; It continued to allow for &ldquo;extraordinary rendition,&rdquo; the capture of terror suspects abroad and their shipping to other countries for detention and interrogation. The U.S. <a href= http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/beyond-torture-the-other-shameful-thing-the-cia-is-trying-to-suppress/375706/ >record</a> on this <a href= http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/7789/the_cia_s_la_dolce_vita_war_on_terror >practice</a> since 9/11 has been a grim history of torture at one remove. True, the order says that no one should be sent to a country in which he or she is likely to be tortured, but the U.S. definition of &ldquo;likely&rdquo; differs significantly from that of the <a href= http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm >U.N. Convention Against Torture</a>.&nbsp; Article 3 of the Convention says no one may be sent to another country if there are &ldquo;substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.&rdquo; The United States insists on a more lenient standard: prohibiting rendition if it is &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; that torture will take place. In practice, this means relying on the word of the receiving country that no harm will be done (wink, wink).</p><br /> <p>* The <em>U.S. Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations</em> prohibits many forms of torture<strong>. </strong>However, a classified &ldquo;annex&rdquo; still permits sleep deprivation and sensory deprivation. The U.N. Committee Against Torture flagged this -- among many other concerns -- in its <a href= http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_COC_USA_18893_E.pdf >recent report</a> on U.S. compliance with the Convention Against Torture.</p><br /> <p>* No high civilian officials or military<strong> </strong>commanders and other personnel were ever prosecuted<strong> </strong>for the torture they ordered or oversaw, nor of course were the actual CIA torturers. Instead they&rsquo;re writing their memoirs and <a href= http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112377/george-w-bush-paintings-freudian-analysis >painting pictures</a> of themselves bathing. If their political power makes it impossible to try them here, perhaps the <a href= http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/10/world/senate-report-lister/index.html >outrage</a> of the international community can at least make Dick Cheney and George W. Bush outcasts like other discredited former rulers along the lines of Serbia&rsquo;s <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87 >Slobodan Milosovic</a> or Tunisia's <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali >Zein el-Abidine Ben Ali</a>.</p><br /> <p>Or maybe the United States could actually follow the U.N. Committee Against Torture&rsquo;s <a href= http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_COC_USA_18893_E.pdf >recommendation</a> and finally sign up for the International Criminal Court.</p><br /> <p><strong>False Assumption #3: Torture only counts when it happens in foreign wars.</strong></p><br /> <p>This is not true either. Sometimes, torture happens right here in the United States <a href= http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jon-burge-ex-chicago-cop-who-ran-torture-ring-released-prison >in police stations</a>, immigrant <a href= http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/03/justice/texas-immigrant-detention-allegations/ >detention centers</a>, and the American jails and prisons that hold <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States >2.3 million people</a>.</p><br /> <p>When the United Nations Committee Against Torture released its <a href= http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_COC_USA_18893_E.pdf >report</a> in November on U.S. compliance with the U.N. Convention against Torture,<em> </em>among the failures the Committee noted were torture and abuse practices in U.S. prisons and immigrant detention facilities. The frequent brutality of U.S. police forces and their <a href= https://www.aclu.org/blog/tag/militarization-police >rapid militarization</a> also alarmed the Committee.</p><br /> <p>Specifically, the Committee pointed to the extensive use of solitary confinement for periods of time longer than two weeks -- the point at which many people start exhibiting <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement >signs of psychosis</a>, including having hallucinations, hearing voices, and experiencing paranoia. In my state, California, there are people who have been kept from all human contact for <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/us/judges-decision-to-hear-inmates-case-threatens-practice-of-solitary-confinement.html >more than 15 years</a>. We are beginning to recognize that the 50,000 to 80,000 people being held in solitary confinement in this country are actually being tortured every day. Furthermore, as the U.N. report emphasizes, some of these people haven&rsquo;t even been convicted of a crime; they&rsquo;re either being held in pre-trial detention or in immigrant detention centers.</p><br /> <p>U.S. prisoners also experience <a href= http://www.justdetention.org/en/jdinews/2014/06_10_14.aspx >high levels</a> of institutionally sanctioned rape and sexual violence. In fact, prison rape is so common, it&rsquo;s a regular plot device on television police procedurals<em>.</em> Want to keep a &ldquo;perp&rdquo; from asking for a lawyer? Threaten to send him to Rikers Island, where who knows what can happen to a pretty guy like him.</p><br /> <p><strong>The Report Is Out. Now What?</strong></p><br /> <p>Make no mistake. Getting even this partial and redacted report into public view is a real victory for everyone who hopes to end state torture. But it&rsquo;s just the beginning, not the end of the fight. There&rsquo;s still much work to do.</p><br /> <p>As a start, someone needs to rein in a CIA whose leadership, past and present, <a href= http://www.businessinsider.com/cia-responds-to-horrifying-torture-report-2014-12 >seems remarkably committed</a> to the effectiveness of torture practices. We need reports like the one the Senate produced about the whole alphabet soup of agencies involved in the &ldquo;war on terror.&rdquo; We need a full accounting, and full accountability, including prosecutions of those responsible, or perhaps even <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/opinion/pardon-bush-and-those-who-tortured.html >official pardons</a> that would at least establish that crimes were committed. We need to end torture in our own jails and prisons.</p><br /> <p>The Senate torture report could be the opening we need to really make U.S. torture a thing of the past.

"The Best Way To Handle Your Family Dysfunction (VIDEO)"	"For many of us, our most dysfunctional relationships are with the people we love most, our family members.  Progressive spiritual leader Rob Bell, bestselling author of <em>Love Wins,</em> discusses how to handle the destructive skeletons hiding in your family's closet in this exclusive clip from the premiere of  The Rob Bell Show  on OWN.<br /> <br />  Families always have a bunch of rules about how things are operated,  Bell says.  But here's the problem with families: no one ever writes the rules down. Correct? So all we know is there's a bunch of rules about what we can say and what we can't say, what's permissible and what's not. But no one ever wrote down how the thing works. <br /> <br /> As a kid, you just pick up on these unspoken rules, he says. But as an adult, you may no longer agree.  This is my blood, this is my tribe, this is my family -- yeah, but they're all crazy,  Bell says.  I love them, but there is dysfunction. <br /> <br /> Once you recognize that you're in an unhealthy situation, Bell says it's time to start creating boundaries.  And what's really hard sometimes for people is to hold in one hand, 'these are my family, this is my tribe, I love them,' but there's also toxic, destructive things here that I can't participate in.  The key, he says, is to balance both.<br /> <br /> So this holiday season, when you're find yourself smack in the middle of family drama, remember: you can love your family while keeping your distance, too. <br /> <em><br /> <a href= http://www.oprah.com/app/the-rob-bell-show.html  target= _hplink > The Rob Bell Show </a> airs Sunday, Dec. 21 at 8 p.m. ET on <a href= http://www.oprah.com/channel_finder.html  target= _hplink >OWN</a>.</em><br /> <br /> <style type= text/css >@media only screen and (min-width : 500px) {.ethanmobile { display: none; }<br /> }</style><br /> <br /> <center><a href= https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostOWN ><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/FBLOGO_0.png ></a> <a href= https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostOWN  target= _hplink >Like Us On Facebook</a> | <br class= ethanmobile  /> <a href= https://twitter.com/HuffPostOWN ><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/TWITTERBIRD.png ></a> <a href= https://twitter.com/HuffPostOWN  target= _hplink >Follow Us On Twitter</a></center><br />  "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 10:50:08 -0500"	"healthy"
"Giving Presence This Holiday Season"	"During this time of year, I would usually find myself counting down the number of days left until New Year's Eve. By early December, I would have already reserved a hair and nail appointment, as well as a table at a hot restaurant that is most likely difficult to book on a weeknight. If I was planning to stay in town, I would have tickets to a gala, and out of town, tickets to a tropical destination like Playa del Carmen Mexico.<br /> <br /> Typically, I've spent hundreds of dollars every New Year's Eve but the most curious part is that I can't even remember how I rung in the 2013.<br /> <br /> Even though I rang in the new year with what was essentially a bout of amnesia, I'd wager what money I had left over from one of those out-of-the-ordinary nights (okay, probably enough for a cab ride home) that I had a blast. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, waking up on Jan. 1 was hardly fun. <br /> <br /> Through my business, I mentor many health coaches and nutritionists, so as I drank their hangover remedy, and wondered why I was willing to take their advice seriously on every day except New Year's Eve? I consider my day-to-day a healthy lifestyle, from my diet (I'm a greens queen) to keeping fit through yoga and meditation. I count myself fortunate to find that my job never feels like  work.  So why am I making New Year's Eve into such a production?<br /> <br /> My inner guide would challenge the blaring questions like: Why is it that post-Dec. 25, do we go back to spoiling ourselves, from picking up items we never got for Christmas on Boxing Day to excessive spending on New Year's Eve festivities?  What are we gaining from overdoing everything on the last day of the year? Why do we want to start the New Year with an inflated credit card bill rather than feeling fulfilled?<br /> <br /> I'd say my feelings about waking up on New Year's Day after a late night out on the town are comparable to how much I enjoyed <em>The Hangover</em>. The first movie was funny but when I saw the second and third films, I wondered why on earth I was wasting my time and money when I already knew what was going to happen.  Why was I not learning that every sequel to <em>The Hangover</em> (both movie and real life) was never as good as the original? No NYE party was ever going to top the last.<br /> <br /> I began following my heart that would tell me that the way you ring in the new year sets the tone for the year ahead.  Instead of living for New Year's Eve in the near future, I realize the best present I can give myself and those around me, is to live fully in the present. <br /> <br /> This year, my family and I decided to do things differently. We won't be spending our money toasting champagne and counting down the seconds until the New Year. We're going to make every second in the present count, spending our time making authentic connections, real face-to-face connections, with others. <br /> <br /> After three months of promoting our new foundation, #TheFreedomProject, business meetings and networking events -- not to mention hours on the computer connecting with inspiring social entrepreneurs over Skype and FaceTime, I am ready to disconnect and just be in the flow. This doesn't mean going away on vacation and relaxing on a beach, which is just another way I could spoil myself. <br /> <br /> We're ringing in the new year by reconnecting.  We're getting back to authentic human interaction with no agenda, where nothing (no friend request, no tweet, no picture on Instagram) is expected in return. It's Christmas spirit that lasts beyond the 25th of December.<br /> <br /> In keeping with the idea that the way you ring in the new year is setting the vibration for the year ahead, we plan to spend the morning of Dec. 31 volunteering our time at a retirement home listening to our elders share their stories and hopefully finding comfort in young people slowing down to hear them out. <br /> <br /> Whereas last year around dinnertime on New Year's Eve, I'd be dining on a multi-course tapas dinner and sipping on a Sauvignon Blanc, this year, we are planning to make healthy meals (thanks to all of my nutritionist friends for the food and snack tips) and hand them out to people living on the streets of Toronto. My decision to opt out of the typical New Year's Eve festivities sets the tone for the rest of the year beautifully. Flow, freedom, presence and purpose.<br /> <br /> Most importantly, this isn't going to be a one-day  trend  but inspired service that will continue throughout the year. Unlike a New Year's Eve party that lasts a few hours and then disappears after the stroke of midnight like fairy godmother magic, I guarantee my high is going to last beyond one night. <br /> <br /> <em>Anna Lozano<br /> Co-Founder of The Freedom Project <br /> www.jointhefreedomproject.com<br /> Facebook: www.facebook.com/jointhefreedomproject<br /> Instagram: @jointhefreedomproject</em> "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 10:49:41 -0500"	"healthy"

"How The 'Quirk' That Caused You Grief Can Lead To Something Wonderful"	"<a href= http://www.oprah.com/omagazine.html  target= _hplink ><img alt= 2012-10-11-omaglogo.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-10-11-omaglogo.jpg  width= 150  height= 45  style= float: right; margin:5px /></a><br /> <br /> By Alexandra Robbins<br /> <br /> Once upon a time, there was a girl named Taylor. When she sat down to eat lunch in her school cafeteria, the girls she'd once called friends stood up and moved to another table. They had cast Taylor out of their clique because instead of going to parties with them on weekends, she'd stay home and write songs on her guitar. The outsider landed a development deal with a record company and moved with her parents to Nashville. She would go on to become the first artist since the Beatles -- and the only woman -- to record three consecutive albums that spent six or more weeks at number one. Taylor Swift (maybe you've heard of her?) is still writing songs and once told a Nebraska audience,  What does it matter if you didn't have any friends in high school when you've got 15,000 of your closest friends coming to see you in Omaha?  <br /> <br /> Swift is a spectacular example of what I call quirk theory: the idea that the differences that might make young people feel alienated are often the ones that win them admiration and respect in adulthood. By <em>quirk</em> I mean an inborn quality, desire, or interest you can't deny. I came up with quirk theory after interviewing hundreds of quirky students, tracking some of them from high school into college; asking quirky adults about their transition from student to grown-up; and poring over psychological and sociological studies to determine why some kids are excluded and what they have in common. Here's my discovery: Each of the adults said the difference that caused them grief in school eventually led to something wonderful. And when they kept nurturing that quality, it continued to give them an advantage. <br /> <br /> Swift's quirk was a deep passion for music, but for you it might have been a talent for drawing that kept you in the art studio during lunch period or high-flying ambition that had you studying on Friday nights. Maybe you had an offbeat sense of style. Or loved nothing more than Space Camp. Or were really into Dungeons & Dragons. <br /> <br /> In adolescence, any kind of difference can cause you suffering. An eighth grader I interviewed told me,  I have to be the same as everybody else, or people won't like me.  Children and teens prize sameness because their still-maturing brains haven't fully developed the ability to navigate complex social relationships. Kids believe that their circle is stronger if their friends are similar. Plus, the process of figuring out how we fit into the world makes us understandably insecure -- and one way to deflect insecurity is to point out others' differences to shift attention from our own. <br /> <br /> But once you're an adult, being different can give you a huge leg up. Management consultant Gary Hamel, who's been called the world's most influential business thinker, writes that the path to success for companies includes leveraging what sets us apart. He encourages people to see  with eyes undimmed by precedent  -- a point of view we can use to embrace what makes us unique. After all, what defines every Next Big Thing? A spirit of innovation. And what lies at the heart of inventive thinking? A knack for seeing the world in a way no one else does. Difference is the quality that sets you apart on first dates and job interviews, that signals your singularity to potential friends. Embracing your quirk helps you become the you-est version of you and share that you-ness with the world. It's just a matter of figuring out your particular thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <style type= text/css >@media only screen and (min-width : 500px) {.ethanmobile { display: none; }<br /> }</style><br /> <br /> <center><a href= https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostOWN ><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/FBLOGO_0.png ></a> <a href= https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostOWN  target= _hplink >Like Us On Facebook</a> | <br class= ethanmobile  /> <a href= https://twitter.com/HuffPostOWN ><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/TWITTERBIRD.png ></a> <a href= https://twitter.com/HuffPostOWN  target= _hplink >Follow Us On Twitter</a></center><br />  "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 10:43:04 -0500"	"healthy"

"5 Ways to Fight Loneliness Over the Holidays"	"The holidays come sprinkled with promises of  brightness  and  cheer.  It's a universally meaningful time for millions of people, and I would argue that this sense of connectedness is a large part of what makes the season seem sort of magical. Yet for many people, the winter months don't always live up to their heartwarming reputation. According to a <a href= http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2006/12/holiday-stress.pdf  target= _hplink >study </a>for American Psychological Association, 26 percent of people feel lonely over the holidays and 38 percent reported an increase in stress.<br /> <br /> A lot of people aren't able to make it home to see their loved ones. Others are enclosed by herds of relatives and still feel a sense of isolation. No matter what your situation, it is NOT uncommon to feel lonely in these months. Going home can stir up emotions we've swept under the rug or may not even be aware of. We're often swung back into settings where a lot of complex memories took place. Some may be joyful but others are painful.<br /> <br /> Many children feel lonely or outcast at some point in their development. In many homes, kids are seen by their parents or early caretakers as good, bad, sharp, slow, burdensome, worrisome, disappointing or destined for greatness. These labels and expectations can hurt us in conscious and unconscious ways throughout our development. When we're thrown back into that childhood setting, or around people we grew up with, we sometimes feel like kids again on the inside, re-experiencing old feelings or just not feeling ourselves. Dr. Dan Siegel refers to this phenomenon as  getting lost in familiar places.  This vulnerability is all the more reason to practice self-compassion and to be wary of old familiar hurtful ways we can think about ourselves. With that in mind, here are a few strategies that can help you stay yourself at the close of your year and on into the next.<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Stop expecting perfection</strong><br /> <br /> Many of us tend to have a picture in our heads of what the ideal holiday should be. We expect it to be as perfectly polished as the shiny ornaments that surround us. The frenzied build up inherently sets us up for a certain amount of letdown. This is particularly observable in children. After Thanksgiving, my nieces confessed to me that they actually felt a little depressed following our family's annual festivities. Thanksgiving is a big deal in our house. We get dressed up, and our big, extended family celebrates the way one would a wedding or gala. The whole day brings a lot of happiness, but much of that is in the preparation: cooking together, setting the tables, posting a large tent in our yard. After that, the kids felt the evening itself just went by too quickly. No matter how great everything turned out, it couldn't quite live up to the excitement they'd felt.<br /> <br /> This is a feeling a lot of people have about everything from presents to interactions with family members.  Maybe old wounds will finally heal, and all we will feel is warmth and love.  We have a fantasy of everything going smoothly, which leaves us all the more crushed when there turn out to be bumps in the road. Try to take pleasure in the little things without attaching too much weight to things you can't control or that don't have that much to do with the life you've created for yourself in the present.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Stop evaluating</strong><br /> <br /> The close of a year tends to be a time of reflection. We may feel a natural sadness that comes with both our losses and our gains. However, there is a fine line between self-reflection and self-evaluation. It's one thing to look back on our year with curiosity and an interest in any changes we'd make in the future. It's another thing to beat ourselves up over our shortcomings and to judge ourselves like a cold critic scrutinizing a performance.<br /> <br /> <em>With so many social gatherings, it's easy to start comparing ourselves to others:<br /> <br /> Everyone is in a relationship. Why are you still alone? It's so humiliating!<br /> <br /> Look how successful he is. You'll never have an important career.<br /> <br /> She is so together. You're such a mess.<br /> <br /> You don't fit in anywhere. You're just different.<br /> </em><br /> These  critical inner voices  make up an ongoing dialogue that reinforces the basic belief that we are not good enough. This inner critic makes us feel worthless and unlike others in some negative sense. It encourages us to be alone, then disparages us for being a loner. It contributes to our loneliness by constantly reminding us we are unworthy of the life we desire and by alienating us from those we care about.<br /> <br /> Get to know this inner critic, because the more we can separate our real selves from its destructive point of view, the better off we will be. Because this inner critic started forming early in our lives based on ways we were seen in our family, expect it to get a little louder when we enter settings from our past. Stay determined in your mission to ignore this cruel coach, and don't listen to its awful advice. Remember it is not a representation of who you really are and will only work to sabotage you.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Spend time with your family of choice</strong><br /> <br /> During the holidays, you may feel obligated to spend time with certain people who don't make you feel that great. Whether you choose to do that or not, it's valuable to set aside some time to be with your family-of-choice. This can be an intimate group of friends, your kids, your partner or anyone who makes you feel good and more in touch with yourself. Carve out time for the people, places and activities that make you feel the most like you, the people who make you laugh, think or feel in ways that are meaningful to you.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. Volunteer</strong><br /> <br /> If you're far away from the people you care about or are feeling disconnected, seek out scenes in which you're sharing something, even with complete strangers. Volunteering is one of the best things you can do for yourself when you're feeling down. It forces you to think outside yourself and share a project with others. Think of a cause that matters to you and take some time to be a part of it. Generosity offers a natural way for us to feel good about ourselves. Plus, being part of a team instantly creates a sense of camaraderie over a shared concern.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Stay in the moment, even when it makes you sad</strong><br /> <br /> Sometimes, it takes being in a room full of people to make us feel our most alone. No matter how many people we pack into the car with us to take to the party, every one of us is our own unique individual person, living and breathing on our own. We all have moments, where we feel a sense of our profound aloneness. When we contemplate our existence, we can expect it to stir us up. The sense of time passing, which can be brought about by a year ending, is always a sobering realization.<br /> <br /> Not every moment will be filled with joy, and even those that are can carry with them a certain amount of poignancy at life's preciousness. New Year's reminds us of years past. It shines light on the faces of those we've lost. It tells us we are older, maybe wiser and far more aware that time isn't something we can grip. We don't have to sink with this feeling. We are better off letting ourselves feel whatever we feel. Sadness can come in waves, and when it passes, we're often left with a sense of peace and vitality. When we try to drown it out we wind up also numbing ourselves to the many pleasures life brings.<br /> <br /> Too often, we distract ourselves from these deeper feelings by busying our minds with worries or critical inner voices. When a negative thought starts to take flight, like a balloon released from the bunch, try not to drift away with it. Gently bring yourself back to the moment. Then shift your focus outward. Think about what you could offer; this will take you out of your head.<br /> <br /> Staying in the moment won't spare us from any feelings of sadness or loneliness, but it encourages us to practice patience and self-compassion. It helps us to feel whatever is really going on in our lives. If we sense that our inner critic is taking over, luring us into self-destructive behaviors, we can kindly bring our attention back to what is important to us. We can take actions that reconnect us to our experiences and the people around us. We can open our eyes to possibilities and consciously create the holiday that will mean something to us.<br /> <br /> <strong>Read more from Dr. Lisa Firestone at <a href= http://www.psychalive.org/author/dr-lisa-firestone/  target= _hplink >PsychAlive.org</a></strong> "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 10:32:50 -0500"	"healthy"
"3 Times When Giving Is Not a Good Thing"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-christmaspresent83119_640.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-christmaspresent83119_640.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-christmaspresent83119_640-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 379  /></a><br /> <br /> At this festive time of year, most people are wracking their brains trying to figure out what presents to buy for each other. The acts of giving and receiving should be pretty easy for us to handle, though, right? So why does it get so frustrating and complicated? We give too little, too much, with strings attached. Giving should enhance our lives and bring us joy, not create more stress and consternation.<br /> <br /> My belief is that giving and receiving joy, whatever form that takes, is one of the main reasons we are on this planet together. However, at times I think we lose sight of our good intentions.<br /> <br /> So in order to avoid turning the act of giving into a negative experience for the giver, the receiver, or both, here is some food for thought when going shopping for everyone on your list this year...<br /> <br /> <strong>1) Giving Too Much or Too Little</strong><br /> <br /> Any healthy relationship has an equal amount of give and take. So contrary to the  saying,  It's better to give than to receive,  you must actually be a giver and receiver <em>both</em> in order for abundance to flow, because giving and receiving stimulate one another. Consequently, an uneven exchange, an imbalance, stops the flow.<br /> <br /> Some people are always giving, but not receiving. That type of scenario eventually builds up resentment. The giver then may begin giving too much and playing the martyr or victim role out of spite to make the other person feel guilty. In turn, those who give in order to get something back or give out of guilt are neither giving nor receiving. It becomes about who gives or gets more stuff -- stuff becoming the measure of one's self-worth -- not a healthy position to take.<br /> <br /> <strong>2) Giving Without Value</strong><br /> <br /> When something is given without value, it is not worth giving or receiving. Whether a gift has value has to do with the intention behind it. You only truly give when the intention is love. <br /> <br /> When we give, (and it doesn't matter if the gift costs money or not), we need to ask ourselves if we are giving out of obligation and/or sheer convenience. How much did you sincerely try? You may not realize it, but the energy of your intention, half-hearted and all, is carried along with your  gift  to the recipient. Don't you think they can feel that you didn't show care? It is important to always be thankful for what we are given, but do you think that sometimes gifts given without valuing the other person can actually hurt?<br /> <br /> <strong>3) Giving What YOU Want</strong><br /> <br /> From an energetic point of view, when you give to others with love based on their needs and wishes, the universe mirrors that intention and brings you that which best aligns with your needs and wishes. <br /> <br /> However, sometimes we get self-absorbed and assume everybody wants what we want... how could they not, right? Well, even though you may mean well, it's important to put yourself in their shoes for a moment. When a gift shows little or no consideration for the other person's personality or interests, but is clearly something that fits your own, then it just looks like it's all about you, not them. Be honest and say to yourself,  Would they enjoy this gift? It doesn't matter if I would enjoy receiving it or not; it isn't about <em>me</em>. <br /> <br /> Everyone always says,  It's the thought that counts!  My question is,  What thoughts are we having?  Maybe we should focus on the children opening presents at holiday time and maybe, just maybe, the adults should have a giving nature and be of service to one another throughout the entire year? Perhaps simply sharing the comforts and spirit of the season with those we love, and at the same time, making an effort to experience, with all our senses, the magical decorations and beautiful music that is all around, is what it's really about...

"A Hard Candy Christmas"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-forhuffpo.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-forhuffpo.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-forhuffpo-thumb.jpg  width= 427  height= 570  /></a><br /> <br /> I am one of three people in this particular solar system who still send Christmas cards by post. The other two are 97-year-old female twins who never married and live in rural Wisconsin in the house they were born in.<br />  <br /> I am an anachronism. And happy to be. In fact, my Christmas card writing remains a treasured ritual of mine, despite the inordinate amount of time and effort it takes, ranking right up there with baking my lovely Scottish mother's recipe for brown sugar shortbread in rounds.<br /> <br /> The tradition has its defined tent pegs. It doesn't feel absolutely right unless I follow certain carefully-prescribed steps. Chalk it up to my heightened sense of occasion. <br /> <br /> First, I prepare hot chocolate. I cannot begin addressing the first blank envelope without a mug of this at my side. And not from a package. <em>Please</em>! I am talking real hot chocolate made with whole milk and premium cocoa powder, brought to a boil on the stove using a timer, with a pinch of salt tossed in for flavor. (Try it!)<br /> <br /> Next, I put on my three most-beloved holiday music CDs, featuring songs no one wants to admit to owning. Top of my list?  Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton's <em>Once Upon a Christmas</em>, with corny, wonderful tunes like  Hard Candy Christmas.  <br /> <br /> Second CD is André Gagnon's <em>Christmas Album</em>. (Remember when they were called  albums ?) It's simply not Christmas until I hear Gagnon's transcendent piano playing wafting through my rooms. <br />  <br /> Third comes a sublime mix of tunes, some obscure, all ridiculously sentimental. Among them, Lee Ann Womack's  The Season for Romance,  Kenny Loggins'  On Christmas Morning,  and Joni Mitchell's  River.  <br /> <br /> <em>It's coming on Christmas. They're cutting down trees. They're putting up reindeer. And singing songs of joy and peace...</em><br /> <br /> Are you singing it yet?<br /> <br /> With music as background, I clear my desk and begin arranging my supplies in an assembly line. Out first come my Sharpie Ultra-Fine Markers lined up in red, blue and green (the 0.7 mm nib is a must),  followed by seasonally-inspired postage stamps, sparkle glue, return address labels, again, appropriately emblazoned, and colorful stickers.  <br /> <br /> Yes, I said stickers. And no, I am not a nursery school teacher. <br /> <br /> Over the years I've gone several routes with my Christmas cards: I have bought them pre-packaged at the mall, ordered them online, and from time to time made my very own from scratch. One particularly energetic year I went to a decrepit paper warehouse down on the lakeshore and bought several poster-sized sheets of thick, heavily textured cream-colored vellum. With just the right knife I sliced across my penciled lines to create the cards, all with one classic ragged edge.<br /> <br /> However they come to be, I set out to make each greeting an event unto itself, a distinctly personal missive for everyone on my list. I include my own salutations, a favorite seasonal quote, and occasionally a copy of a favorite New Yorker cartoon, Christmas-themed of course.<br />  <br /> Among the funniest of these shows two little girls chatting on a park bench. One says to the other:  I like the Easter Bunny: I find him less judgmental than Santa. <br />  <br /> Another pictures Santa Claus stretched out on a psychiatrist's couch. He looks troubled. In the caption he is saying to the doctor:  Sometimes I don't read my mail. <br />  <br /> Once the cards are assembled, out comes the pièce de résistance: my sealing wax kit with my short, fat sticks of gold wax and Great Gatsby-style brass monogram stamp. <br /> <br /> I'm not the first to go to such trouble. Sealing letters this way is a 600-year tradition, one that secured the confidentiality of important dispatches. A broken seal implied broken trust. No one of integrity would dream of tampering with the wax emblem.<br /> <br /> It is decadent and fun stamping my letter with a flourish on the back of each envelope. The heated dripping wax is unpredictable, granted, and the results vary wildly, but the imperfection is a large part of its charm, I think. My letter <em> M </em> in gold adds the final touch of elegance and tradition to my greeting. <br /> <br /> Who does not adore receiving a big red envelope in the mail the week before Christmas, hand-addressed to them and embellished within an inch of its life?<br /> <br /> And I love doing it. <br />  <br /> Like Kenny and Dolly, it is the perfect pairing.

"The Implications of Understanding -- for Performance and Beyond"	"Take a moment and consider the implications of this statement: If a person who doesn't know that feelings can only generate from within gets insecure or angry, it will appear logical (to that person) to blame these feelings on the nearest circumstance or individual. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> What implications occurred to you? Domestic violence? Road rage? Bullying? Racism? Animal cruelty? How about war? Indeed, every problem known to mankind can be traced back to a misunderstanding of where feelings come from. That's why, even though most of my work revolves around performance, I usually end my talks by saying:  What we're discussing here is not small potatoes. <br /> <br /> But let's circle back to performance for a minute. What are the performance implications of not blaming the world around you for what's happening within you? What are the performance implications of knowing that your feelings come from the inside -- from your thinking -- and not from circumstance?<br /> <br /> Plenty. And I'm going to use the sport of golf to illustrate. If a golfer stands over a shot, feels nervous, and looks outside to explain his nerves, here's what happens: He blocks his innate ability to overcome his nerves. If the same golfer stands over a shot, feels nervous, and does not look outside -- his nerves will fade as he automatically self-corrects. That's a pretty big implication for golfers, yes? <br /> <br /> Let's follow this further: Because he's not self-correcting, the golfer in our first scenario will almost always reach for a shortcut -- a mental technique -- to rid his head of unwanted thoughts. But since the use of such techniques requires thought, the golfer's feelings and performance level will spiral downward even more. In other words, at the heart of any golfer's bound-up feelings is an outside-in misunderstanding (believing that feelings come from circumstance). This misunderstanding leads to steered shots, bad decisions, and self-centered behavior on and off the course.<br /> <br /> To be clear, no person understands 100 percent that his or her feelings originate from the inside. We're all prone to miss it. That's the reason my work is strictly about deepening levels of understanding -- or pointing people in the direction of their innate ability to self-correct. <br />  <br /> What are the implications of deeper levels of understanding? Take a moment and consider that question, too. Here's a hint, though: The answer is not small potatoes. "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 10:15:22 -0500"	"healthy"
"Thriving in Uncertainty"	"<center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-thriving.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-thriving.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-thriving-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a></center><br /> <br /> I was steps away from the Far Away Café only it wasn't far enough away. The name evokes a tropical location, bongos and Pina Coladas. Instead, it was inches away from a packed security line at JFK and a foot from the flight I didn't want to take. I was way too close to reality and frankly would rather hide under the covers.<br /> <br /> My mom was recently diagnosed with brain cancer and I was going home to see her for the first time. If I could pick up any of the other shoes on that security conveyor belt I would. If I could get on any flight but this one, I would. But this was a choice I wasn't free to make. I had to face this and I had to cope. But how?<br /> <br /> Two people close to my heart were diagnosed with cancer within five months of each other. I never thought I would ever have to face something like this, much less in the same time period. The  C Word  can be life-altering, paralyzing and can render you helpless, if you let it. This disease has tested me on every level -- faith, intuition, stamina, truth, resentment, vulnerability and trust. Most of all it has made me ask why way too many times.<br /> <br /> The first diagnosis came several months ago, and it was earth shattering. I was the only person there when it was first discovered and I moved into autopilot, choosing to care for this person in a way that I had never had before. I battled with my own vulnerability; I was internally terrified, but my exterior reflected an artificial calm.<br /> <br /> At times it felt like lights that were too bright, or a room that was way too cold, as it stripped me down to a reality I wished I never had to see. I broke down alone; I took lots of supplements and relied on the healing techniques that usually support me. I gave without hesitation, I prayed a lot and thankfully the situation has since stabilized.<br /> <br /> Only a few months later, another bowling ball knocked me over. Now it was my mom. She had no symptoms. She was on a vacation and suddenly had a seizure. Boom. Brain cancer. I can barely type the words -- actually I won't say them again because it gives the disease power. It is all very sudden, dramatic and frankly shocking. She takes care of herself physically and is very diligent. How could this happen to her? How could this happen to us? I have done a lot of soul searching, asking why? Cursing the Universe. Questioning my path. Wondering where my life is going. Feeling so drained I can't rest or get out of bed. Feeling so angry I can't even express the words. All of my questioning led me to what I already know to be true.<br /> <br /> I am a holistic practitioner and at least 50 percent of my sessions are to help clients connect their physical and emotional health. I devote client sessions to this. I write about this. I run retreats related to this. You can eat  perfectly,  you can exercise, you can take supplements, but what are you feeding your soul? Our emotional imbalances can manifest into physical issues. My mother took care of herself physically but not emotionally. Out of respect for her privacy all I will say is that her childhood was far from perfect, and there is quite a bit of resentment, disappointment and hurt from that time in her life. Those unresolved issues created a wound in her that attracted additional issues over the years with a similar theme. My mom went many years not working on these patterns and past hurts, until now.<br /> <br /> This diagnosis forced her to surpass the physical and go deeper. She has been working with healers to connect to herself. It has already allowed for such incredible shifts in her relationships, values and core beliefs. I have witnessed a transformation in so many of the relationships that have been causing her pain for so long. Ironically, these are some of the people who are showing her the most love. But even beyond those relationships, people who she might not have been as close with are texting her the most beautiful words, dropping off baked goods, bringing over meaningful gifts that provide strength and praying for her. They are sending such good will and there is so much strength in love. She is touched by the beauty in the genuine support she has received, and it has renewed her faith in humanity, and given her a new perspective. She now knows she was never alone, she is in control of her life, and she has already witnessed many miracles. She is so important to so many people and this is the first time she ever really believed it.<br /> <br /> I do have some resolution to the  why  question I continue to ask myself. Both people's journeys have forced me to go inward. I have been working on my own vulnerability -- accepting it and understanding it. I am learning how to be strong and supportive while honoring my own feelings. I can be authentic emotionally, and also be resilient. I can be a caretaker and care for myself. But even more than all of this, I have learned how to draw strength from those sending good will, and how to shield from the naysayers -- this includes doctors, family members and friends who spread their fear. I believe in something greater.<br /> <br /> Life is all about perspective. This year has felt like a blackout. You always hear stories about how days without power and technology force you to sit still, and be present. It forces you to connect to your loved ones in a new way, but you still wait for the day where the lights turn back on and the comfort returns. I have since learned that the power is within us all. We have the strength to light the way with our thoughts, our faith, our connection to one another and our belief in love. We have the strength to survive it all.

"Top 4 Advantages of a Heart Rate Monitor for Your Workouts"	"Your individual heart rate is one of the most accurate, vital and realistic ways to indicate and measure your exercise intensity in any given workout that you may be engaged in.   What's awesome is that you can use this information to determine on any given day if your body is compromised, running at your own peak levels and or exceeding your current fitness level.  You really get to know yourself when it comes to physical activity.  Tracking this info over time is valuable when assessing your fitness level and overall physical condition on going.  Knowledge is power!<br /> <br /> Here are your top four advantages for using a heart rate monitor:<br /> <br /> 1.  <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12762827  target= _hplink >Utilizing a heart rate monitor for any activity gives you definitive data</a> on what effort level it takes you as an individual to accomplish a given task as well as under what circumstances (i.e., weather; indoor or outdoor workout; machine or free flow; fatigue; effects of medication or caffeine; sea level; time of day, and more. In other words, what does your body have to do and put forth in terms of effort to accomplish the chosen physical feat of the day?  <br /> <br /> 2. A heart rate monitor is a fantastic tool giving you clear indication and evaluation of the condition of your cardiovascular system during physical activity.  Again, awareness is power!

"The Power of Our Stories"	"<em>We tell ourselves stories in order to live.</em> Joan Didion<br /> <br /> <strong>The Power of Our Stories</strong><br /> <br /> Our stories define us. They affect our well-being, our relationships, our present and our future. They are vehicles of energy, vessels of possibility. They contain infinite potential and we can harness light and power from the experiences of our lives. Every ordeal we have suffered holds some treasure for us. Every catastrophe has stripped us of something and given us something. The nakedness, we know. The gifts are yet to be unearthed. According to Hannah Arnedt, <em>the story reveals the meaning of what would otherwise be an intolerable event. </em><br /> <br /> It takes time to harvest our experiences, to ferret out the events that are enduring and valuable, despite their consequences. It never happens by default. It happens by paying attention to the things that happen to us, mining them for meaning, consolidating the facts, and creating the story with its narrative arc, its climax, its resolution. If you are going to share it, it is kind to have a point to the story. That would be the gift you offer the listener. The value you bring to the exchange.<br /> <br /> I sent this story out to my Museletter list this week. It was an old story, printed years ago in <em>Marry Your Muse, </em>but I had found the photo of the man I was talking about and I wanted to give them the gift of that image. I hit SEND and went off to do errands. When I returned home three hours laters, over 200 people had written to thank me. THAT is a lot of gratitude. And what does it say to me? That we are hungering for stories of meaning, of relationship, of conquering fear and doing it anyway. We need each others' stories. As Arthur Frank writes in <em>The Wounded Storyteller</em>,  To tell one's own story, a person needs others' stories.  Here is my gift for the day...<br /> <br /> GO FIRST<br /> <br /> I once started out in my Honda Civic on a cross-country trip through the small towns of America. I was a young photo-journalist, intent on interviewing ordinary people about their social and spiritual values. I left from upstate New York and headed south, excited and afraid at the same time. I drove right through Pennsylvania, lacking the courage to talk to anyone. My great idea didn't feel so great anymore. I had a yellow legal pad on the passenger seat and kept adding questions I wanted to ask people, and while my list grew longer, I grew shorter on confidence by the day. I drove through three more states without asking anyone anything.<br /> <br /> Finally, I drove into a Waffle House parking lot in Virginia and pumped myself up. I would walk into the restaurant and look around. If someone made eye contact with me, I'd ask if I could interview them. I took along a copy of my book, <em>Making Peace: One Woman's Journey Around the World</em>, for the sake of credibility, and of, course, my yellow legal pad with all the questions.<br />  <br /> One man in the back caught my eye when I came through the door. He was wearing a denim jacket and a Playboy baseball cap. He was the only one in the place making eye contact with me. So I approached him, said what I was doing, showed him my book, and asked if he had a few minutes.  Yes,  he said, so I sat down. When I pulled out my pad of questions and focused in on the first one, I looked right into his eyes and asked,  Where did you get your values? <br /> <br /> He stared right back at me with a deep, vacuous look, and after several long moments, said, with a very southern, two-syllable drawl,  Wha-ut?  <br /> <br /> I panicked for a second, and then heard a little voice in my own head whisper  Go first.  Realizing I could be helpful by giving an example, I went first and told the story of how my mother always told me, when I passed a person on the street, to look that person right in the eyes, give them a big smile, and say  Hi,  as friendly as I could. I told him it was difficult at first, since I was young and pretty shy, but then it got easier and now I do it all the time, because it's just part of me.  So being friendly is one of my values,  I said.  And I got it from my Mom. <br /> <br /> He kept nodding his head and chewing on his toothpick, until he finally asked,  Is it like this? When I was little and my daddy used to whup me when he'd get a drinkin', I'd go out on the back porch wantin' to cry and my grandaddy would be there. He'd look at me and say, 'Son, looks like you've got some big feelings goin' on. Why don't you get yourself a pad of paper and go down under that oak tree and write yourself some poems. That'll help you with them big feelings.' So I did, I wrote a lot of poems. I still do, when I need to work out my feelings. Wanna hear one? <br /> <br /> He recited a poem by heart, and then wrote it down in my journal. And we sat in that plastic booth for another hour and a half while he told stories he had never told to another person -- about his own anger, his big dreams, his pickup truck and double-wide, his drinking problem, his fear of being in love and messing it up like his dad. And every story he told me illuminated my own darkness, taught me something I never knew, and opened my heart to bigger love and deeper courage. He found parts of himself that had been long lost, simply because I was there to hear and receive them. And the same was true for me. When we left that restaurant, we were two different people from the ones who had walked in, alone and afraid.<br /> <br /> What I learned that day was the importance of  going first.  I didn't know, all those years ago, that the word leadership comes from an Old English word meaning  go first.  It came like a whisper from the Muse, a nudging that caused me to open and share in such a way that the other person knew it was safe for him as well. My story was a gift to him. It was a tale of the passing on of values, wrapped in a few paragraphs, a little history, and some visual images. And yet, it was powerful enough to evoke his own history, his own creative wisdom, and the courage to speak of his fear and dark nights. And from that intimacy and vulnerability grew a new story, a universal story, the story of Going First.<br /> <br /> I now know,  from that one experience,  that I can be the cause of a profound conversation, if I dare to go first, if I share something personal and meaningful, if I ask of another a question that matters, and listen like our lives depend on the answer. Since I value such conversations, and rely on them for my joy and sanity, I've been practicing this for many years now, learning more from others' lives than I could from any book. And it's because of that energy exchange, that vitality that rises up when two people open the pages of their hearts, share their wonderings, find their commonness. That is the energy of transformation, the power of story. It whisks us away from our sense of aloneness, draws back the veil between one and another, and rustles up, like a gentle wind, newfound feelings and age-old knowing.<br /> <br /> ---<br /> <br /> <em>Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

"Practicing Presence at the Holidays"	"As much as we may love the holidays and enjoy being with family and friends, they also have a unique ability to seduce us into believing the thoughts and stories that make us unhappy. As the old adage goes, if you think you're enlightened, go home to mom and dad and the rest of the family and see what happens. If you haven't completely released the grip of the past, it will surely come back to haunt you now. The holidays are an especially good time to sit quietly and welcome the full range of your experience with mindful awareness. Here are some reminders for flowing through the holidays with presence and grace:<br /> <br /> <strong>Only the present moment exists</strong><br /> <br /> It's tempting to get embroiled in the unfinished business of a lifetime when you're spending time with the people who helped create it in the first place. Even if your parents are no longer with you, or you're the parents now and the kids come home to you, it's easy to get triggered by the old familiar interactions, the habitual banter and patterns of behavior. But the truth is, the past no longer exists except as thoughts in your mind right now. In this moment, is there any problem that isn't generated by your thinking, judging, interpreting mind? Let go of the thoughts, and the past has lost its hold over you. <br /> <br /> <strong>Don't take anything personally</strong><br /> <br /> For the rest of the year you may be well aware that the seemingly separate self you take yourself to be is actually intimately interconnected with everyone and everything else -- and then a family member says a few words that trigger a lifetime of anger and hurt, and you suddenly feel solid and separate again. First of all, don't beat yourself up for losing your cool -- any state, whether hot or cold, is destined to arise and pass away. Consider it a welcome opportunity to return home to a deeper level of peace and equanimity that isn't disturbed by the turbulence at the surface.<br /> <br /> <strong>You are the source of the happiness you seek</strong><br /> <br /> At the holidays we tend to forget that happiness is our birthright, our natural state, not something external to us that other people can bestow upon us. If you go into the holidays without expectations about what others will do for you, your innate happiness and peace of mind will remain undisturbed, and instead you can enjoy the resonance of love, gratitude, and generosity that seems to come to the foreground at this time of year.<br /> <br /> <strong>No one is to blame</strong><br /> <br /> Your current life situation is the result of an indeterminate number of causes and conditions that have impacted you throughout your lifetime. No one person or event is the cause of your difficulties. In fact, from the perspective of an awakened heart, nothing is missing from this moment right now, and everything is complete and perfect just as it is. When you recognize this inherent perfection, the whole issue of blame falls away.  No one could possibly have acted differently, given their own unique limitations, so even forgiveness becomes unnecessary in the light of this deeper truth. <br /> <br /> <strong>If you want to make God laugh, tell her your plans</strong><br /> <br /> Perhaps because you're working extra hard to avoid  negative  feelings and experiences during the holidays, you may run the risk of micromanaging every situation and event in order to keep it light and positive -- and end up making everyone miserable in the process, including yourself. From snowstorms and traffic delays to illnesses and absences, be prepared for surprises and go with the flow. If you try to force your agenda on your loved ones, no matter how well-meaning it may be, they'll only feel manipulated rather than cared for. Here again, the mantra is, let go, let go, let go.<br /> <br /> <strong>In the end, there's only love</strong><br /> <br /> When you let go of the mistaken belief that you're in control, you have the opportunity to fall back into the current of love that's always actually running the show. You're just a vessel or vehicle for this love to flow forth into the world in the way that's unique to you. Drop your agenda, your expectations, your blame, your demand for love and attention -- and be the love that you and all beings already are. Happy holidays!

"How a Dating Buddy Can Transform Your Search for Love"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-bigstockAdarkgrungyroomwithadoor15691754.jpg ><img alt= 2014-11-07-bigstockAdarkgrungyroomwithadoor15691754.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-bigstockAdarkgrungyroomwithadoor15691754-thumb.jpg  width= 285  height= 270  /></a><br /> <br /> What brings wisdom<em> and</em> pleasure, is free, and can change your entire romantic future? A dating buddy. A dating buddy is a friend and co-coach in one of the most defining tasks of your life: your search for a mate. If you follow no other suggestion than this one from my entries, your dating life will change. And you'll have an enriching new addition to your social life.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooy2SYUjdT4  target= _hplink >Here is the short video</a> that captures the heart of the learning partner concept. <br /> <br /> Quantum physics, the great sages, and practical experience all teach the same lesson: When we touch any part of our lives with compassion and non-judgmental attention, that part of our lives can blossom. When it comes to changing unhelpful behavior patterns, willpower has surprisingly little leverage. As I explain in my book <a href= http://www.amazon.com/Deeper-Dating-Seduction-Discover-Intimacy/dp/1611801222  target= _hplink ><em>Deeper Dating</em></a>, what we need is a wiser angle on things and the presence of authentic support. If you feel that your dating life isn't progressing in the way you wish it would, try a dating buddy. In the presence of this relationship, you'll probably begin to see the changes you're hoping for.<br /> <br /> I once got lost in the woods and decided I'd try to find my way back without using a compass. I thought I'd just trust my best judgment and see how well that worked. My little experiment turned out to be a disaster. I spent hours thinking I was making headway, yet I ended up at approximately at the same place I started from! So I admitted defeat and pulled out my compass. It directed me down paths that felt completely unfamiliar. But it got me right out of the woods.<br /> <br /> In our search for intimacy, most of us fall into patterns that just don't work. And that's where we need an outside eye. Our closest friends can tell us -- in about a minute -- what blocks us from finding real love. But do we ask? And do we listen? The rules of the dating buddy relationship are different from the common rules of friendship. Of course, when you and your dating buddy get together, you'll eat, drink, laugh and bemoan the dearth of available mates, but you'll do other things as well. You'll be honest about the patterns you keep replaying, and you'll get help in avoiding the pursuit of unhealthy attractions, and guidance in cultivating healthy ones. You'll also talk about sex -- not in a superficial way, but with a sense of exploration, because sex is like an X-ray into our intimacy gifts and struggles. And you'll open yourself to advice. That's strong medicine, I know, but aren't we really looking for that? It's an enriching experience to be both student and teacher with the same person, and that's what you'll have with the right dating buddy.<br /> <br /> In my decades as a therapist, I've seen this again and again: Clients who ask for -- and listen to -- the advice of wise, loving friends have more successful lives. Dating may be a lonely journey, but you don't have to take it alone. Having a dating buddy will definitely make it more fun.<br /> <br /> This will be an important relationship for you, so choose well. As with a therapist, it makes a huge difference whom you choose. It must be someone who will keep your secrets secret. Someone who will bring a sense of hope to your journey. Someone emotionally safe, and insightful.<br /> <br /> How do you find such a person? Here's my suggestion. Look at your address book from the past few years, and ask yourself these questions:<br /> <br /> • Who is kind?<br /> • Who has wisdom?<br /> • Who is essentially reliable, and really cares about you?<br /> <br /> Highlight each person's name. Dating buddy or not, they are your dream team. Wherever they live, whatever they are doing in their lives, they are the people to focus on. And any one of them who is single can be your dating buddy.<br /> <br /> When you find your dating buddy and agree to take this journey together, you can use my blog entries and exercises as a workbook for your exploration. I can virtually promise you two things: You will enjoy having a dating buddy, and your dating life will change and grow in ways that you probably couldn't have achieved on your own.<br /> <br /> Exercise 1: First meeting<br /> <br /> Get together with your dating buddy, either in person (preferably) or by phone. Make a plan to meet or talk on a regular basis, based upon the realities of your schedules. At your first meeting, allow each partner to answer these simple questions:<br /> <br />  What's going on in your dating life at this time? Are there problems or challenges you keep hitting up against? Are you noticing any areas of growth?<br /> <br /> How do you wish to grow and change in your intimacy journey? What new behaviors do you think would be helpful or empowering?<br /> <br /> After that, just allow your conversation to develop naturally. Enjoy your first meeting with your dating buddy, and keep us posted!<br /> <br /> <em> If you'd like to receive information on Ken's classes, events and writings, or learn more about his upcoming free teleseminar,  A New Map of the Path to Love, <a href= http://www.deeperdating.com/signup.html  target= _hplink > please click here</a>.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Follow Ken on <a href= https://twitter.com/KenPageLCSW  target= _hplink >Twitter</a> and <a href= http://www.facebook.com/kenpagelcsw  target= _hplink >Facebook</a></em><br /> <br /> <em>© 2014 Ken Page,LCSW.

"The Most Racist Thing About Serial Podcast: Mail Kimp"	"I, like many people, have become completely obsessed with <em>Serial</em>, however, there is one thing about the podcast that always makes me cringe. It's not the way the podcast deals with race, how Sarah Koening's white privilege creeps in, or the way she perpetuates the myth of the model minority, as scrutinized in <a href= http://www.salon.com/2014/11/17/from_the_greatest_podcast_ever_made_to_shamelessly_exploitative_an_introduction_to_the_serial_backlash/  target= _hplink >other blogs</a>. In fact, I love the podcast and eagerly await this week's final episode. The part about <em>Serial</em> that bothers me most is the advertisement for <a href= http://mailchimp.com/  target= _hplink >Mail Chimp</a> that airs at the beginning of every episode. <br /> <br /> According to what I read <a href= http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/now-nprs-serial-podcast-runaway-hit-mailchimp-reaping-rewards-161642  target= _hplink >online</a>, Serial reporter Dana Chavvis is asking people on the street to say  Mail Chimp , the name of an email mailing service. The third person stumbles, mispronounces  chimp , saying  kimp  and then finally says  chimp . I cringed the first time I heard it. Maybe I'm more attuned to this because I am Korean American and I have grown up hearing people with strong Korean accents. I am 95 person sure the person is an Asian female who does not speak English as her first language. I do not think the person is a child, as proposed on <a href= http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2lhg5b/new_evidence_mail_kimp/  target= _hplink >reddit</a> or on <a href= http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/now-nprs-serial-podcast-runaway-hit-mailchimp-reaping-rewards-161642  target= _hplink >Adweek</a>. Neither did the people I played it for today. If I'm wrong, I'll be the first to apologize.<br /> <br />  Mail Kimp  has caught on, as many things online have, and morphed into it's own thing. It has it's own hashtag and it's become a <a href= http://www.wired.com/2014/11/wtf-is-mailkimp-meme/  target= _hplink >joke</a> between <em>Serial</em> listeners. Mail Kimp even has it's own <a href= https://twitter.com/MailKimp  target= _hplink >twitter</a>, <a href= http://www.tumblr.com/search/mail+kimp  target= _hplink >tumblr</a> and a catchy <a href= https://soundcloud.com/kpffkl/mail-kimp-remix#t=1:06  target= _hplink >Soundcloud</a> remix that makes me want jam for a second until I realize I feel sick. And, if you go to <a href= http://mailkimp.com  target= _hplink >www.mailkimp.com</a> you're redirected to Mail Chimp.<br /> <br /> In fact just today, we were discussing the benefits of using Mail Chimp in regard to our organization, the <a href= http://ensj.weebly.com/  target= _hplink >Educators' Network for Social Justice</a>, email blasts and I started to feel my palms get sweaty and my heart beat faster. Anxious anxiety was boiling up inside me. It's a reaction that I only feel when something really racist has happened to me, akin to Bell Hook's  killing rage .<br /> <br /> Why did Mail Chimp decide to use this audio byte of the woman mispronouncing their name? I guess maybe they thought it was cute or endearing. I find it completely offensive and when I hear it I have a visceral reaction. I can't talk about <em>Serial</em> without mentioning the way the advertisement makes me feel. In fact, now that the advertisement has played 11 times (once for each episode) I cannot disassociate the company with the offensive audio byte, which is why I reacted the way I did during the discussion about Mail Chimp at my meeting. <br /> <br /> I don't find anything cute about second language learners mispronouncing words, and the fact that so many people are giggling, laughing, or just plain making fun of this Asian woman. It is troubling. What does it say about people? It's okay to make fun of people who don't speak English as their first language? How old are we? Why hasn't anyone else written about this online yet? Am I really the only person who thought this was an obvious racist <a href= http://www.microaggressions.com/  target= _hplink >microaggression</a>? I wonder what Ben Chestnut, Asian American and CEO of Mail Chimp, thinks of it. In fact, I tweeted both <a href= https://twitter.com/melissatempel/status/544220115772796928  target= _hplink >Chestnut</a> and Dana <a href= https://twitter.com/melissatempel/status/544220818268372994  target= _hplink >Chivvis</a>, and await their replies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <blockquote class= twitter-tweet  lang= en ><p><a href= https://twitter.com/danachivvis >@danachivvis</a> is the woman saying &quot;mail kimp&quot; an Asian woman?</p>&mdash; Melissa B.

In this changing news and media environment, that special trust in Brian is more important than ever, and therefore wherever Brian is, the audience follows. <br /> <br /> Though NBC News has not released the exact terms of the new contract, the <a href= http://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-st-brian-williams-20141215-story.html#page=1  target= _hplink >Los Angeles Times speculates</a> that the deal will keep Williams in the  Nightly News  anchor chair for an additional five years at upwards of $10 million annually.<br /> <br />  It's probably time I admit that I am a one-trick pony,  Williams said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.  I am, I think, designed and put on this Earth to do what I'm doing now -- and that is to eat, sleep and breathe nonfiction and the news going on in the world. <br />  "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 11:14:46 -0500"	"entertainment"

"New PBS Special 'Extreme Realities' Explores Security Threat From Climate Change"	"What kind of new realities will climate change bring this century? The latest episode in the PBS series  <a href= http://www.pbs.org/journeytoplanetearth/home/  target= _hplink >Journey to Planet Earth</a>  explores the rising threat of extreme weather and the effects climate change is already having on the geopolitical landscape around the world.<br /> <br /> Narrated by Matt Damon,  Extreme Realities: Severe Weather, Climate Change and Our National Security  also features  World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, former EPA Administrator Carol Browner, journalist Thomas Friedman and others.<br /> <br /> In the clip above, viewers are introduced to the rising tensions on the border between Bangladesh and India. Bangladesh is one of the <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/world/asia/facing-rising-seas-bangladesh-confronts-the-consequences-of-climate-change.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >most vulnerable countries to sea level rise</a>. Climate change, along with economic hardship and other factors, may force an even greater number of Bangladeshis to seek refuge in India. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this problem isn't limited to the region. It would be  perhaps possible for the international community to deal with  this if it were an isolated incident, Former Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell explains in the video. But  the issues associated with ... climate refugees are not going to strike in one place,  he says.  They’re going to strike consequentially around the globe. <br /> <br /> <em>Watch a second exclusive clip below and tune in to PBS at 10 p.m. ET on Monday, December 15 to see the entire hour-long documentary.</em><br /> <br /> <span class= js-fivemin-script ></span><script type= text/javascript >(function(){var src_url= https://spshared.5min.com/Scripts/PlayerSeed.js?playList=518557726&height=351&width=570&sid=577&origin=undefined&videoGroupID=155847&relatedNumOfResults=100&responsive=false&relatedMode=2&relatedBottomHeight=60&companionPos=&hasCompanion=false&autoStart=false&colorPallet=%23FFEB00&videoControlDisplayColor=%23191919&shuffle=0&isAP=1&onVideoDataLoaded=HPTrack.Vid.DL&onTimeUpdate=HPTrack.Vid.TC ;if (typeof(commercial_video) ==  object ) {src_url +=  &siteSection= +commercial_video.site_and_category;if (commercial_video.package) {src_url +=  &sponsorship= +commercial_video.package;}}var script = document.createElement( script );script.src = src_url;script.async = true;var placeholder = document.querySelector( .js-fivemin-script );placeholder.parentElement.replaceChild(script, placeholder);})();</script> "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 11:10:51 -0500"	"entertainment"
"Hamish Holmes,  Mycroft Goes Fishing and The Sign of Three Moriarties: Roz Warren's Predictions for Season Four of Sherlock"	"The BBC's  Sherlock  is among the most popular shows on TV, and there has been much speculation among die-hard fans like myself about what the upcoming fourth season will hold. Having consulted my own crystal ball, here's what I see happening:   <br /> <br /> Irene Adler turns up at 221B Baker Street with Sherlock's baby, the result of some fun and games the two of them indulged in after Sherlock rescued her at the end of  A Scandal in Belgravia.   (It wasn't love, he was just passing the time while waiting for his coat to get back from the only good dry cleaners in Karachi, Pakistan). The baby is, of course, named Hamish Holmes. (And Sherlock's  safe word?   Oopsy! )   <br /> <br /> Adler meets and falls madly in love with John's philandering alcoholic sister Harry. (Irene cures her drinking problem by smacking her with a whip and yelling  drop it!  whenever Harry picks up a drink.) They wed and raise the baby together.  <br /> <br /> Moriarty turns out to be just one of a set of triplets, all of whom are named Jim, and only one of whom blew his brains out at the end of  The Reichenbach Fall.  (One down, two to go...)<br /> <br /> Scotland Yard decides to save a lot of time and trouble and just investigate anybody Molly Hooper falls in love with, since they all turn out to be  dangerous sociopaths.<br /> <br /> Mary Watson gives birth to a girl, whom she and John name Sherlockia (In Season 27 of  Sherlock,  she and Hamish Holmes will fall in love.) The only glitch? Mary assassinates her ob-gyn when he doesn't give her an epidural quickly enough.<br /> <br /> Lestrade comes out and becomes Mycroft's  goldfish.  <br /> <br /> Hilarity ensues when Sherlock babysits for babies Hamish and Sherlockia. After he finally gets them down for a nap, he relaxes by analyzing the spit-up from their binkies under a microscope.  <br /> <br /> Mrs. Hudson, unable to rent out 223C Baker Street, decides to restart her ex-husband's drug cartel and run it from there, making it all too convenient for Sherlock to get the occasional morphine fix.  <br /> <br /> After Jim Moriarty2  kidnaps their baby, John and Mary track him down and take turns assassinating him.  <br /> <br /> Moriarty, Sherlock and Irene Adler start a  Sherlock Characters Who Fake Their Own Deaths Too Much  support group. <br /> <br /> John and Sherlock are taken hostage by a devoted fan who insists that they're a couple and forces them to go through with a gay wedding, but as they're standing at the alter, about to take their vows,  Mary tracks the fan down and assassinates him. <br /> <br /> In a terrific viewer-grabbing crossover episode,  Sherlock, the Doctor and Batman all give their sidekicks the day off and solve crimes together, racing to a variety of crime scenes in London cabs, the Tardis and the Batmobile.  <br /> <br /> Because  the canon  requires that Mary Watson die of a mysterious illness, Mary steals the Tardis, travels back in time and assassinates Sir Arthur Conan Doyle before he can write that plot point.     <br /> <br /> Molly Hooper and Janine start a  Women Who Love Sherlock Too Much  support group. Millions of fans sign up. <br /> <br />  But seriously? Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss are going to come up with a bunch of  ideas for Season Four that are a million times better than mine. And this fan can't wait. "	"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 11:08:34 -0500"	"entertainment"
