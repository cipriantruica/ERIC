"Stage Door: <i>The Elephant Man, Lost Lake</i>"	"<img alt= 2014-12-13-HuffpoEM.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HuffpoEM-thumb.jpg  width= 290  height= 250  style = float: left; margin:10px ><br /> <br /> <b><i>The Elephant Man</i></b> is back on Broadway -- thanks to Bradley Cooper, the Hollywood hunk who demonstrates the theatrical chops to portray the deformed Englishman John Merrick. In Victorian times, Merrick, covered with tumors and billed as  half man, half elephant,  was cruelly exhibited in sideshows until the kindly prominent Dr. Treves rescued him.<br /> <br /> Treves (Alessandro Nivola), who initially wants to study Merrick, doubles as his protector. Thanks to the generosity of the London public, he secures him a permanent home in the hospital. <br /> <br /> Now at the Booth Theater, <i>The Elephant Man</i>, which won the Tony for Best Play in 1979, is effective because it isn't literal. Cooper doesn't wear a prosthetic; instead, the audience imagines his disfigurement as he contorts his body. And people gasp in horror at the sight of him.<br /> <br /> It's a successful conceit. Cooper holds himself in a punishing pose, his mouth terribly twisted, as he struggles to speak. Mrs. Kendal (Patricia Clarkson), a famed actress, discovers his romantic and sensitive nature. She introduces him to the upper crust, which also comes to gaze, albeit in a more civilized and friendly fashion. Indeed, be it lord or lady, all find the best elements of themselves in Merrick. <br /> <br /> And that's playwright Bernard Pomerance's larger point. Merrick may be grotesque on the outside, but his affliction hides a caring, truthful soul. Victorian society, with its workhouses and freak shows, is ruled by rigid mores and social propriety. <i>The Elephant Man</i> carefully unmasks its prim hypocrisy, but stops short of digging too deeply, which would only enhance the text.<br /> <br /> Still, it's a thoughtful work, brought to fruition by Cooper's riveting, heart-wrenching performance. He expresses a myriad of emotions, revealing the dignity and intellect of a man whose interior life is as rich as his exterior is hideous. Clarkson's performance is beautifully calibrated, whether she's discussing <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> or, in a crucial scene, offering Merrick his first look at a woman. <br /> <br /> Nivola delivers a subtle and wonderful turn. His Dr. Treves has an initial arrogance, but as he realizes the enormity of Merrick's spirit, his own vulnerabilities are revealed. This is as much Treves' story as Merrick's, delivered by a top-notch cast and capable ensemble, led by Anthony Heald, Henry Stram and Scott Lowell.<br /> <br /> Director Scott Ellis keeps the pace moving. He relies on a minimal set design to focus attention on the story. In our era, when wealth is grossly exploitative and political indifference trumps social compassion, <i>The Elephant Man</i> offers a mirror on our own humanity.<br /> <br /> <b><i>Lost Lake</i></b>, now at City Center, is written by David Auburn, who won a Tony in 2001 for his masterwork <i>Proof</i>. The lofty themes of <i>Proof</i> mined the nature of reality, both mathematical and personal.<br /> <br /> Conversely, <i>Lost Lake</i> is a quieter effort. Veronica (Tracie Thoms) travels from Manhattan to upstate New York to rent a shabby rustic house for a week. Hogan (John Hawkes), the down-on-his-luck owner, promises much, but rarely delivers. His good intentions are marred by his limitations.<br /> <br /> Veronica is polite but distant; she just wants a pleasant vacation for her children. Yet during the week, the two swap tales of unhappiness. Succor, they find, can come from the most unlikely quarter. They aren't friends; care is mitigated by circumstance. <br />  <br /> With his gangly air, Hawkes is spot-on in his ability to project a weird but well-meaning concern. Thoms nicely captures what happens to the responsible when life veers off-course. <i>Lost Lake</i> is a reminder of the quiet desperation that lurks above and below the surface. Neither its characters nor story is memorable, but its message, the possibility of the kindness of strangers, resonates.<br /> <br /> <i>Photo: Joan Marcus</i> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 17:26:22 -0500"	"arts"
"New J.K. Rowling Story Reveals The History Of The Leaky Cauldron"	"J.K. Rowling posted a new riddle on Harry Potter fan site Pottermore today -- part of a 12-day series during which new writings and magical tidbits will be released as the ultimate Christmas gift for wizard-loving muggles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Here's today's quiz:</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt= pottermore  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388746/thumbs/o-POTTERMORE-570.jpg?2  /><br /> <br /> The answer, as Hogwarts fanatics know, is Diagon Alley, the bustling street where Harry first picks up his school supplies and wand. Rowling rewarded those who responded correctly with further details about the Leaky Cauldron, the famous pub that serves as a gateway to Diagon Alley, including the names of a few of its former owners. <br /> <br /> Today's prize was a two-for-one: Rowling also shared an anecdote about Florean Fortescue, a Diagon ice cream shop owner who was originally slated to play a bigger part in the Harry Potter series. <br /> <br /> While some fans delight in such details, others think that Rowling let readers take over the Potter narrative <a href= http://thoughtcatalog.com/nico-lang/2013/09/why-j-k-rowling-needs-to-let-harry-potter-go/  target= _hplink >rather than meddling with the concluded plot</a>.<br /> <br /> If you're in the first camp, check out these stories J.K.

"Jeffrey Marsh, Vine Star, Discusses Their Work As An Activist"	"<strong>Editor's Note</strong>: <em>Jeffrey Marsh is open to the use of any pronoun but for the purposes of this profile, we are using  they/them/their. </em><br /> <br /> You may not know who they are -- but you've no doubt heard their message.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://jeffreymarsh.com/  target= _hplink >Jeffrey Marsh</a> is a social media star who <a href= http://vine.co/jeffreymarsh  target= _hplink >utilizes Vine</a> to spread messages of positivity and awareness on a massive digital platform. Their Vines have collectively received more than 90 million views, ultimately providing Marsh with the opportunity to take their message outside of social media and speak and perform all over New York City.<br /> <br /> Marsh is most notably known for spearheading the viral hashtags #DontSayThatsSoGay and #NoTimetoHateMyself.<br /> <br /> In the technological age, the face of activism has evolved along with the way in which we communicate. Marsh is part of a generation of LGBTQ activists who, through social media, are changing minds and perceptions in parts of the world where people may not encounter a queer person in their day to day lives.<br /> <br /> The Huffington Post chatted with Marsh this week about their work as an activist, the way in which they utilize social media and what they have planned for the future.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Huffington Post: How did you become a Vine star? </strong><br /> <a href= http://jeffreymarsh.com/  target= _hplink >Jeffrey Marsh</a>: By accident! I'm doing what I always did: dress up like Julie Andrews, dance around, tell people they're awesome as heck, sing them songs and (literally) kick up my heels to some catchy Katy Perry.<br />  <br /> The only difference now is the camera, the chance to post those moments for gay kids in Arkansas and Canadian moms. No other form of social media I've tried allows me to immediately connect like Vine does. It is very much like a face-to-face social experience. Each day I'm shocked and excited to find messages from people who feel like my videos help them to be themselves. I guess I became a  star  by being myself. <br /> <br /> <strong>When did you realize that things were really heating up and people were starting to take notice?</strong><br /> That's the funny thing, it was so gradual -- so natural. There are plenty of people in social media who burn brightly and fast, who go viral and get (almost) instant fame. For whatever reason, my journey so far has been consistent and incremental. I picture one friend telling another; a grass roots approach to fame. <br /> <br /> It would be hard to argue that my message isn't popular. But is it the most popular? Not by a long shot. I'm reminded of Joan Rivers talking about some advice she once got: if 0.1% of America thinks you're funny, you'll fill stadiums for the rest of your life. I'm not sure I will ever fill a stadium, but I think Joan and I are both talking about quality over quantity. This is most true when it comes to cultivating a relationship with the like-minded people who call themselves fans. And I'm happy to say that those fans are all over the figurative (and literal) map: old, young, black, white, trans, bi -- you name it! Everybody is welcome and can hopefully connect with my inclusive message. <br /> <br /> <img alt= jeffrey marsh  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2382524/thumbs/o-JEFFREY-MARSH-570.jpg?8  /><br /> <br /> <strong>Did you have a strategy or a plan in the beginning or were you just creating Vines that felt right to you and putting them out in the world?</strong><br /> Did I have a plan? Definitely not! I always knew I wanted to tell as many people (in as many ways as I could) that there is nothing wrong with them. I just started posting things that brought a smile to my face, that helped me feel excited to post again -- to connect again. <br /> <br /> I don't like dwelling on the  larger  implications of what I'm doing. There have been hundreds of messages from people who decided not to commit suicide because of my channel, for instance. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that's happening! It's just that all I did was look into my iPhone camera and tell a friend they're beautiful for being alive. I don't ever want to lose that connection. Is that simple direct approach a strategy? Maybe it is…<br /> <br /> <iframe class= vine-embed  src= https://vine.co/v/OvjBaZ7Jde1/embed/simple  width= 570  height= 600  frameborder= 0 ></iframe><script async src= //platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js  charset= utf-8 ></script><br /> <br /> <strong>Do you approach your vines differently now than you did at the beginning? What has changed for you?</strong><br /> Maybe part of my success, and the success of Vine overall, is the relatability factor. People can see me; they can look into my eyes, which never happens on Twitter. I've shied away from making more polished,  produced  vines because I'm concerned they will lose a personal touch -- a humanity that is so essential to one of my missions: showing that LGBTQ folks are just folks. We are all human.<br /> <br /> One thing that has changed for me is the recognition of the responsibility I have. I say it in a grandiose way because I don't think I'm representing just LGBTQ folks. I've realized recently that my gender identity is a metaphor. I have the chance to be a voice for many of the voiceless outsiders in the world -- the heartbroken people who have felt left out. If my interactions on Vine are any indication, there are a lot of us out there!<br /> <br /> <strong>What’s it like to see a hashtag campaign you’ve created take off and touch so many people?</strong><br /> It's ultra-fulfilling and fun. To know that people benefit, to know that people get it and are changed by what I do is a reason to get up in the morning. It's also a reason to glue on false lashes when I'm a little tired and skim through hate e-mail to answer my followers. #DontSayThatsSoGay and #NoTimetoHateMyself brought out so many different kinds of people; people who would never be in front of a camera, never would be that visible on social media. They felt the message, their participation was that important. And everyone's participation is that important! It really excites me to see that. Being in front of the camera feels natural for me, but when someone else who might be nervous or shy puts their truth on Vine, it is very inspirational. <br /> <br /> <blockquote class= twitter-tweet  lang= en ><p><a href= https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dontsaythatssogay?src=hash >#Dontsaythatssogay</a> <a href= https://twitter.com/JeffreyMarsh >@jeffreymarsh</a> I am gay.

That's what's important: the connection, the changed lives. I often feel like my life has been changed most of all.<br /> <br /> <strong>When it comes to gender identity and sexual orientation, how would you describe yourself?</strong><br /> I never want anyone to feel bad. Ever. So, I decided a while ago that there is no  wrong way  to refer to me. I know that words and pronouns are really important to a lot of people. I respect that deeply. Several times a week, people ask  what's your preferred pronoun?  which is nice of them, but I have no idea! <br /> <br /> For me, connecting is most important. If someone is being respectful, I don't care what they use. I'd love to have an interaction with someone who says a pronoun that doesn't seem true for me at that moment, and we talk about it -- we connect over it. Excluded from all this is, of course, is hate speech. I just don't engage that. <br /> <br /> I don't want to deflect the heart of the question though! Personally, I don't walk around thinking of myself as  her,   man,   they  or any other word we've currently got going. I guess that's part of why I love hearing everybody's stories on Vine -- I can relate to men and women and everyone. When we're talking about being human and having feelings, there is so much that we have in common.<br /> <br /> <strong>What’s the one thing you hope people take away from what you're doing? If you could boil everything down into one message, what would it be?</strong><br /> Always, always, always the message is the same: There Is Nothing Wrong With You. With varying degrees of success I'm sure, I keep it all hovering around that theme. Tweets, Instagram and, of course, my Vines are all an effort to help people ditch the self-hate and self-judgement. What could be more important? <br /> <br /> <strong>What do you want to accomplish in 2015?</strong><br /> Let's take over the world! I would be very happy if The Message (see above) could reach more people and bring more of us together. Helping one person is a cause for celebration to me, and I plan to keep celebrating that one-at-a-time connection by Vining my heart out. <br /> <br /> <em>Want to see more from Jeffrey Marsh?

"Les Freres Corbusier Is Back! And So Is Herbert Hoover!"	"Now that Alex Timbers is a big Broadway director and also the co-creator/writer of an Amazon series (<em>Mozart in the Jungle</em>), I was afraid we wouldn't see much from his theater company, Les Freres Corbusier. But not so! Les Freres is back with a tribute to, or a roast of, our nation's 31st president, Herbert Hoover. I've seen the majority of Les Freres' past works, from <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> to <em>Heddatron</em> to, my favorite, <em>A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant</em>. My friend and I loved <em>A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant</em> so much. She gave birth on October 29 and, a few days later, I asked her what the baby was for Halloween. She replied:  How about he wore this tunic that is reminiscent of a costume in our favorite Scientology pageant?  I seriously can't believe it doesn't come back every season, but, moving on.<br /> <br /> Les Freres is back to its roots, off-off-Broadway, with a special workshop production of <em>Here's Hoover! The Historic Herbert Hoover 2014 Comeback Special</em>, written by Sean Cunningham, with songs by Michael Friedman (Broadway's <em>Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson</em> with Timbers) and directed by Timbers. The piece--running at the Abrons Arts Center through December 21--is inspired by Elvis Presley's iconic 1968 <em>Comeback Special</em>, except its starring Hoover. He doesn't have the same sideburns, but he is desperate to reclaim his relevance, politically and culturally. Who doesn't want to see a Herbert Hoover concert spectacular? But -- who thought of it? And why?<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HeresHoover0031r.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-13-HeresHoover0031r.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HeresHoover0031r-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 295  /></a><br /> <br /> I posed some questions to the creatives behind the hysterical piece:<br /> <br /> <strong>Q: When did you start working on the show?</strong><br /> <strong><br /> Timbers: </strong>The show began life about 8 or 9 years ago.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cunningham:</strong> I believe it was 9 years ago now: Alex and I had an evening when we went out for drinks and came up with 4 possible shows concepts. 2 were forgotten almost immediately, 1 received a reading at Ars Nova and stalled out, and the last reached Michael Friedman and became Here's Hoover. <br /> <br /> <strong>Friedman</strong>: I got involved right before we did some development work in La Jolla. I had done three shows with Sean, and <em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson </em>with Alex.<br /> <br /> <strong>Q: Why Hoover? What sparked the interest in him specifically?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Timbers: </strong>Les Freres has always been interested in legacy and the reappraisal of historical figures. In part, what sparked us to Hoover was that he was one of the few Presidents of the 20th century that hasn't undergone a major reexamination by historians.<br /> <br /> Hoover also lived for quite a long time once he was out of office. It seemed like an intriguing question to wonder what it would be like to have your political life defined so clearly by a single historical event and a perceived reaction to said event--and then live out the remainder of your life knowing your legacy has been defined and not being able to do anything to alter it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cunningham: </strong>We were fascinated by the fact this was a genuinely extraordinary man - an orphan from Iowa who became a globetrotting mining millionaire by 27 and then headed massive humanitarian efforts during World War I - who is remembered now for the only part of his life that didn't go amazingly well. Throw in that he died at 90, having survived for 31 years after leaving the presidency and another 20 after the death of his beloved wife of 45 years, and we thought,  This is a little more interesting than Gerald Ford.  Not to knock Jerry. <br /> <strong><br /> Q: What do you think constitutes a failed vs. successful presidency? Were you thinking of that when working on this show?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Timbers: </strong>One of the key qualities to being a successful politician is one's ability to connect emotionally with your constituents. A lot of historians view Hoover's greatest flaw as his inability to communicate effectively his empathy for the American public. But one looks at Carter's  crisis of confidence  speech and can make a case that too much empathy repels. So it's a question we thought would be ripe to explore.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cunningham: </strong>That is an extremely interesting and virtually impossible to answer question! I think it's a mix of:<br /> 1. Undeniably great achievements: Keeping America unified during a Civil War like Lincoln or desegregating the military like Truman are feats that only become more worth celebrating with each passing year. Presidents like Rutherford B. Hayes don't have a whole lot of these.<br /> 2. Inspiring or dispiriting the nation: Clearly some leaders - say, George Washington or JFK - made Americans think,  Anything is possible.  And others - thinking Andrew Johnson and Nixon - made Americans muse,  What's the point of even trying? <br /> <br /> These two criteria are often (but not always) connected, which is something I think infuriated Hoover both during his term and in the years to come.<br /> <br /> <strong>Friedman: </strong>I think after [<em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</em>], which was about an apparently successful presidency that history has increasingly judged a disaster, in terms of economics, human rights, it was interesting to look at a presidency that ended in apparent failure, but which history hasn't yet made its final judgment on. I don't tend to agree with Hoover more than with Jackson, but his failure doesn't really have anything to do with the things I disagree with. <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HeresHoover0074r.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-13-HeresHoover0074r.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-HeresHoover0074r-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Q: Who came up with the Elvis conceit? How did that person/people come up with it?</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Timbers:</strong> Sean Cunningham and Michael Friedman are responsible for all the brilliant dialogue and songs in the show and the realization of the situation and these fantastic characters, but the crude premise of the show stems from my fascination with the 1968 Elvis special.<br /> <br /> I loved a few things about it: <br /> 1. The idea of having the self-awareness of one's own career arc to call your concert a  comeback  special (whether this was Elvis' idea, the producer's, or whomever). <br /> 2.The wild emotional intimacy that Elvis had with the concert attendees and his ability to break the  fourth wall  without any sense of artifice. <br /> 3. And, finally, from a purely directorial perspective, Elvis had a thrust stage set up with girls surrounding him and fawning, seated on pillows. Simultaneously though, Elvis had this quite gruff and playful relationship with his older, male instrumentalists that seemed so casual that it almost had no interest or regard for the surrounding audience at all. <br /> <br /> The set up of all this was a precursor to the later <em>Unplugged</em> and <em>Storytellers </em>series--and just had an informality and general strangeness that seemed worth exploring. Eventually pageantry and pop instincts kicked in on the Elvis special, with costume changes, back up singers, and enormous light up signs--but the first gesture of the special was truly idiosyncratic and borderline bizarre.<br /> <br /> We wanted to honor all those elements--the pillows, the muttering ax men, the leather jumpsuits, and lightbulb billboards--as well as the rockabilly sound, and we thought: who is more ripe for a comeback than Herbert Hoover? So that's where the idea came to be of mashing up the peculiar idiom of the Elvis special and the specific historical figure of our 31st President.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cunningham: </strong>I'd also been obsessed by the Elvis '68 Special - when I was working at the sadly unlaunched magazine Maxim for Kids many years ago I remember going on my lunch break to Times Square to buy the DVD set at the then-existent Virgin Megastore -  and I thought there was something wonderful about someone as practical as Herbert Hoover deciding he needed to connect with people on a more emotional level and stumbling upon footage of The King and thinking,  I shall do that,  as if overpowering sexual charisma comes with a handy on and off switch.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Friedman: </strong>I mean, Elvis. What's not to love?<br /> <br /> <em>All photos © Joan Marcus.

"Saudi Artist Photographs Daily Life From Behind A Veil And Learns Unexpected Lesson"	"While the mandate that women should cover their hair is an tenet of Islamic belief, the act of wearing a veil that completely shields a woman's face is a matter of tradition, not religion. For Saudi photographer <a href= http://www.faisalalmalki.com/  target= _hplink >Faisal Almalki</a>, this female ritual remained one shrouded in mystery. He resolved to experience the practice for himself, documenting the entire experience with his camera.<br /> <br /> <img alt= untitiled  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381070/thumbs/o-UNTITILED-900.jpg  /><br /> <br />  It started as both a visual and investigative experiment,  Almalki told the Huffington Post Arts.  From a visual point of view, I -- as a photographer and person -- cherish sight and I've always wondered how veils affect sight and seeing. But on a more contextual level, I've always wanted to understand this sub-culture and I thought if I managed to at least see the world they way they see it, I might scratch the surface of 'walking a mile in their shoe.' <br /> <br /> For his photographic investigation, Almalki took inspiration from 20th century German biologist Jakob von Uexkull, particularly his idea of the '<em>umwelt</em>' or 'self-world as perceived by organisms living within it.' The artist stepped into the role of biologist to fully immerse himself in this alien way of life.  Understanding how organisms experience their surroundings, needs and motivations can only be achieved by stepping into their perceptual world,  the exhibition expressed.  An organism creates and reshapes its own <em>umwelt</em> when it interacts with its environment.  <br /> <br /> <img alt= breath  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381072/thumbs/o-BREATH-900.jpg  /><br />  <br /> Almaki titled his series  Lone Canyon,  referencing the gap between a woman and her veil. Yet as the photographic process continued, the artist noticed it changing shape.  I took a few photos of flowers as seen from behind the veil, except some of those flowers weren’t real –- but the veil affects vision enough for us (ie. Her) not to see the difference. And that’s when I realized that I wasn’t trying to understand veiled women, I was trying to judge them.  While the project began as an effort to see through an Islamic woman's eyes (and veil), it ended up revealing the biased mode of viewing the artist himself possessed.<br /> <br />  Those pictures instead became a portrait of my prejudice,  he explained.  I’ve always resented how some western media outlets profiled Muslims and Middle Eastern, and this showed me how I was doing the same. Turning the veil onto that barrier between us and 'the others,' whoever that might be. <br /> <br /> <img alt= post  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381076/thumbs/o-POST-900.jpg  /><br /> <br /> As Almaki's series progressed, the symbols associated with the veil changed shape.  When I started working on this project, I kept saying that I wasn't pro or against veils, I just wanted to offer their perspective to the world.  Yet Almaki realized that for many, the veil isn't just a symbol of difference but of inferiority, of otherness.  Suddenly, the veil, became a symbol of prejudice, that wall between any person and 'the others.'  Almaki's project then transformed into an investigation of the invisible veil that so many unknowingly wear, the obstructive layer of prejudice.<br /> <br />  Lone Canyon  runs at Athr Gallery in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia until January 10, 2015.

"Designers Recreated Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel IRL"	"Do you wish the world around you was just a little more symmetrical? Maybe eternally washed in a candy-colored Instagram filter? Perhaps with a stronger Bill Murray presence? Basically, do you yearn for a daily life that looks identical to a Wes Anderson film? <br /> <br /> You should think about booking a trip to Budapest. <br /> <br /> <img alt= buda  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387196/thumbs/o-BUDA-900.jpg  /><br /> <br /> Earlier this year, during <a href= http://designweek.hu/2014/  target= _hplink >Budapest design week</a>, curators at <a href= http://nextartgaleria.hu/aktualis/  target= _hplink >NextArt Galeria</a> teamed up with designers Zsuzsa Megyesi and Attila F. Kovacs from <a href= http://a-z.eu.com/  target= _hplink >A+Z Design Studio</a> to lift Anderson's aesthetic from the screen to real life. Opting to creating an art experience far removed from the  white cube,  NextArt installed its gallery's goods in a space crafted to mimic the set of  The Grand Budapest Hotel.  <br /> <br /> The resulting lounge, a lavish medley of furniture, design, film and contemporary art, feels like a haunted version of Anderson's set, imbuing the famously twee visionary with an extra dose of darkness. A+Z contributed the eerie design touches like the candle-holder and chandelier, while artists including András Braun, Tamás Dobos and Lili K. Fehéri submitted artworks equally ominous. <br /> <br /> Anderson buffs, eat your heart out and enjoy the unorthodox gallery experience below.

Teicher</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt= arm  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387510/thumbs/o-ARM-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>The Cosmic Crusher and Grandmaw Foots face off in the final match.</small><br /> </center><br /> <br /> When Katrina Arnold photographed a ladies arm wrestling brawl in New Orleans a few years ago, she was instantly hooked. The raucous events, which are hosted by <a href= http://nolaw.org/  target= _hplink >New Orleans Ladies Arm Wrestling</a>, combine the performative, athletic elements of a WWE match with the communal, boozy aspects of a trivia night. It’s one of more than 25 chapters across the world under the umbrella of the<a href= http://www.clawusa.org/the-leagues/  target= _hplink > Collective of Lady Arm Wrestlers. </a><br /> <br /> “They're such colorful events. You never know what's going to happen,” Arnold said. “I got addicted. I ended up joining the collective and taking pictures of my friends.”<br /> <br /> At NOLAW’s events, which are held a few times a year at bars, galleries, and other spaces across the city, eight arm wrestlers—each with their own costumed persona, theme song, and entourage—compete before hundreds of spectators. According to NOLAW, “rules are determined and managed by the referee, only to be manipulated and corrupted by celebrity judges, crowd hecklers, and dolla billz.”<br /> <br /> The events aren’t just fun and games. They’re also fundraisers, with all proceeds benefiting local groups supporting women and children. (The groups, in return, create the winner’s trophy and submit a member to wrestle in the tournament.)<br /> <br /> Photographing arm wrestling, Arnold said, is like photographing a concert: It involves shooting fast-moving subjects in low light, as well as avoiding getting in the way of audience members. Still, she said, NOLAW’s events are “a photographer’s dream.” Hilarious wrestler alter egos—Babe Lincoln, Amelia Armheart, Ruth Hater Ginsburg—come with equally outrageous costumes and stunts as they prepare to compete. Half-time acts include drag queens and burlesque dancers. Crowds are loud and enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> “We want to create a fun, safe atmosphere where we can show off these strong, empowered women doing something that allows them to act out however they want,” she said. “You can be sexy, strong funny—you create a character. The best part is seeing these expressions come out on stage. It's more about performance than the actual arm wrestling.”<br /> <br /> Arnold’s photographs will be on display in the exhibition, “Katrina Arnold: Wrists Up” at New Orleans’ Gradoux Gallery as part of PhotoNOLA from Dec. 4 through Dec. 7.<br /> <br /> <em><a href= http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/12/03/katrina_arnold_photographs_new_orleans_ladies_arm_wrestling_tournaments.html  target= _hplink >See more photos on Slate.</a></em> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 21:10:25 -0500"	"arts"
"Alvin Ailey Unveils World Premiere, <i>Odetta</i>"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Odetta_Bio1_930_01.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-Odetta_Bio1_930_01.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Odetta_Bio1_930_01-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 320  /></a><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wednesday night I saw an array of beautiful luminaries including: the still handsome Harry Belafonte, the ever talented Ruben Santiago Hudson, and the magnificent Jessye Norman (to name just a few) who came out to see the world premiere of <em>Odetta</em>, choreographed by Mathew Rushing for<strong> Alvin</strong> <strong>Ailey</strong> <strong>American Dance Company</strong> and presented at  <strong>New York City Center</strong>. <br /> <br /> Legendary Odetta Holmes was one of the boundless and stunning voices of the civil rights movement, wise in thought, rich in voice and able to convey the very deep nature of anger and despair that swept the African American culture onto the rocky road to freedom from tyranny and isolation -- embodied through the earthy sound of folk music, composed by many and sung Ms. Holmes. Listening to a recording of her talking about the trials of these times with such poetic grace it is hard not to be stirred by her words and all the history of feeling such marginalization. Some of the songs which the choreography is set to are, <em>Sometimes I feel Like a Motherless Child, Cool Water and Glory, Glory. </em>Hope Boykin presented a buoyant Odetta in her physical incarnation as the activist/singer setting her profound voice to motion. <br /> <br /> A favorite moment was when Rachael McLaren and Marcus Jarrel Willis pantomimed the famously comical <em>There's a Hole in the Bucket</em> from an old recording of Harry Belafonte and Odetta. I could not help but turn around for a moment to see Harry Belfonte smiling while leaning on his walking stick. Marcus Jarrel Willis was a delightful Henry to Ms. McLaren's Liza. <br /> <br /> The evening radiated passionate feeling from the dancers to the audience which was returned with the over-wilhelming appreciation of all seated. It did seem sometimes like the synchronicity of the dancing was not quite fully cooked; the lighting design was dull and lackluster, the costuming was mediocre at best, even with that being said I would not have missed it for the world. Alvin Ailey's <em>Revelations</em> is no less inspired now then it was in 1960. Especially <em>Sinner Man </em>danced by Jeroboam Bozenan, Collin Heyward, and Sean Aron Carmon.

We're having a rare moment in America where we're being forced to confront our troubled social history with law enforcement and race, and ask ourselves hard questions about who we are as a society. And the men and women in the streets in Ferguson are a big part of the biggest conversation of the year.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Ebola Caregivers</strong><br /> <img alt= ebola doctors  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386032/thumbs/r-EBOLA-DOCTORS-large570.jpg  /><br /> <em> Andadolu Agency via Getty Images <small></small></em><br /> They are the front line in the war against the biggest Ebola outbreak in history. It's too easy to forget about an epidemic half a world away, but the healthcare workers struggling to contain the disease that has already killed 7,000 people in West Africa deserve to be recognized for their efforts, bravery, and sacrifice.<br /> <br /> <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong><br /> <img alt= putin horse  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386002/thumbs/r-PUTIN-HORSE-large570.jpg  /><br /> <em>AFP via Getty Images <small></small></em><br /> Sure, he's basically a Bond villain, but the Russian president has managed to stay in the spotlight this year from the protests around the Sochi Winter Olympics to the Russian annexation of Crimea, to promoting unrest in eastern Ukraine. You don't have to like the guy, but it's hard to argue with the effect he's had on 2014.<br /> <br /> <strong>Taylor Swift</strong><br /> <img alt= taylor swift  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386102/thumbs/r-TAYLOR-SWIFT-large570.jpg  /><br /> <em>Associated Press <small></small></em><br /> Time will tell if Taylor Swift's rejection of Spotify's music streaming business model was a tempest in a digital teacup or a seachange moment as artists push back against emerging forms of distribution. One thing is clear - as one of the world's top-selling artists, she has an important role to play in figuring out how the new digital world will compensate creative people for their work.<br /> <br /> <strong>Jack Ma</strong><br /> <img alt= jack ma  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386120/thumbs/r-JACK-MA-large570.jpg  /><br /> <em>Associated Press<small></small></em><br /> The former English teacher founded Alibaba (think the Amazon.com of China), and cashed in with a $25 billion IPO.

"Social Worker Empowers Muslim Women In Need With Sewing Class"	"When Tahani Jabarin started the Introduction to Sewing and Dressmaking program at the <a href= http://www.daralhijrah.net/ns/  target= _hplink >Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center</a> in northern Virginia, she was hoping to create  a road to self-sufficiency  for Muslim women in her area. Made possible by a $10,000 grant from <a href= http://www.irusa.org/  target= _hplink >Islamic Relief</a>, a U.S.-based charity organization, the sewing class graduated its first class of 12 students on Nov. 5.<br /> <br /> Jabarin, 37, told The Huffington Post she could not be happier with the results.  Thank God things went great,  she said.<br /> <br /> A social worker at Dar Al-Hijrah with no background in sewing, Jabarin said she chose the subject because it's something women with children can do from home. Jabarin runs the program, but she hired a woman with commercial sewing experience to teach the actual classes. Women ages 18 and above who earn half the area median income or less, or who receive financial assistance like food stamps, were eligible to sign up for the first round of lessons, as long as they agreed to attend every one, Jabarin said.<br /> <br /> Participants were also asked to pay a $300 fee for the class, but were issued waivers if they were unable to afford the cost. In exchange, the women received six hours of instruction every week for 16 weeks, with an additional four-hour workshop on starting their own business. Projects included clothing and home decor like curtains and lampshades. Dar Al-Hijrah sells the students' work on-site, Jabarin said, and each student gets 50 percent of whatever proceeds her pieces bring in, meaning the women can receive an income even during the program.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sewing class  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371058/thumbs/o-SEWING-CLASS-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps most significantly, those who completed 100 hours of sewing received their own machine, which Jabarin described as crucial for ensuring the women would continue their work after graduating. Of the 12 women who graduated in November, Jabarin said that more than half started making an income within two weeks of completing the course. A new 16-week course, she said, began earlier this month.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sewing class  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371048/thumbs/o-SEWING-CLASS-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> <br /> Jabarin spoke with one of the graduates on behalf of HuffPost Religion to illustrate the program's effect on participants. Due to a language barrier, Jabarin spoke to the woman in Arabic and translated her answers into English.<br /> <br /> <strong>How did you find the sewing group?</strong><br /> <br /> My name is Fawzia, and I was born in Sudan. I am 42 years old, and I have eight children, ages 25, 23, 17, 9, 8, 5, 2 years old and 4 months old. As an immigrant mother with eight children, I was facing financial instability that lost me my apartment and led me to seek a home in a shelter. Fortunately, the shelter I was placed in happened to be within walking distance of Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center. Through [a social worker's] help, I joined the sewing class, which enabled me to become self-sufficient via training whilst establishing an income. I applied for a waiver, since I had no income through which to pay for this class, and I received it, rendering my sewing lessons charge-free.<br /> <br /> <strong>What have been some of the biggest struggles in your life since coming to the U.S.?</strong><br /> <br /> My most immediate issue was the language barrier. I required some time to learn the English language and become accustomed to speaking it. Secondly, as a mother, I faced the enormous problem of finding an apartment to rent for me to live in with my children. Having been blessed with a large family, it was difficult finding a place big enough to accommodate us. Not being able to be a self-sufficient mother who could provide for her children shook me to the core.<br /> <br /> <strong>In what ways, if any, does the holiday season affect these concerns?</strong><br /> <br /> The holiday season is more taxing, as this is a family-oriented time during which I wish to present my children with the most joyous experience possible whilst also working hard to provide for them. I received support from my children’s elementary school, which donated gift cards to me in order to be able to purchase the Thanksgiving turkey. Simultaneously, I receive continuous support from Dar Al-Hijrah, which has a thrift store on-site. At any point that I need assistance buying clothing, I apply for aid and receive a $100 gift card to use at the store in order to keep my children and myself warm during this colder time of year. <br /> <br /> <strong>In what ways has joining the sewing class made a difference in your life?</strong><br /> <br /> During this difficult year of my life, these obstacles enclosed me in a severe depression that I even received therapy for. Nothing seemed to really help me deal with the crippling mentality that I was unproductive until I joined the sewing group. Walking down from the shelter to the Islamic Center every Monday and Wednesday became something to look forward to, and my mood was automatically elevated on those days.<br /> <br /> Additionally, the shelter kept telling me that I had an “exit date” and that I had to find a place to live. It just so happened that my graduation date coincided with my exit date from the shelter. It was my graduation, and the program director’s recommendation, that allowed the shelter to extend my stay for one more week. My life had finally begun looking up. I was becoming self-sufficient, which had always been my dream, and I was finally able to provide for my children.<br /> <br /> I learned that much like sewing, life occurs in several stages, not all at once. Having acquired patience, I was able to push myself through these difficult times and persevere until I was able to improve my life. Having received my certificate of completion and my sewing machine, I finally felt like a productive member of society.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are your hopes for improving your family’s circumstances moving forward, and how will the skills you’ve learned through the sewing group help you?</strong><br /> <br /> The day I graduated, I received my sewing machine from Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center. Furthermore, Dar Al-HIjrah connected me with the county’s case workers, who held several workshops that taught us to transform our sewing skills into a commercial method in order for us to establish our own businesses and become self-employed.<br /> <br /> I walked into this class thinking I would only be taught to sew clothing, but soon thereafter I learned that was not the case. Aside from sewing clothing, I learned how to create home décor items like handkerchiefs and even custom-made draperies. I am now beginning to build my clientele, and I plan to develop my skills in this field in order to become more proficient and to find even more stability in my job. This way, I will finally have a steady income and be able to independently support my family.<br /> <br /> <em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Learn more about Islamic Relief and how you can contribute to its ongoing grants and programs <a href= https://secure2.convio.net/irusa/site/SPageServer;jsessionid=4569B1589CCFA21CD1D360E867DD2DF6.app260a?pagename=domesticlandingpage  target= _hplink >here</a>.</em><br /> <br /> <em>This story is part of series called <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/12-families/  target= _hplink >12 Days Of Giving</a>.

"Christmas Trees Past in Philadelphia"	"Although retailers seem determined to start the holiday shopping season as early as October these days, for many of us the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season does not start until after Thanksgiving. We bring boxes of holiday decorations out of storage, place candles in our windows, buy a tree, start baking cookies, and do whatever else our families have traditionally done over the years to celebrate the holiday. The Library Company's photographic collections confirm that Philadelphians of a hundred years ago celebrated the holiday in many of the same ways as we do now.<br /> Some of the busiest public spaces in Philadelphia, like Independence Square, were decorated for the holiday season during the early 20th century. At 6PM on Christmas Eve 1913 in front of a crowd estimated at 20,000 people, the mayor's wife threw a light switch to illuminate a huge spruce tree behind Independence Hall. Decorated with 4,200 red, white, and blue lights and topped with a star of 56 lights representing each signer of the Declaration of Independence, the Philadelphia Inquirer described the spruce as the  first Christmas tree that ever was set up for all the people of the city.  <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-raup2012591.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-raup2012591.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-raup2012591-thumb.jpg  width= 549  height= 570  /></a><br /> William Rau, <em>Christmas tree in Independence Square, Phila, Christmas Eve, 1913</em>, gelatin sliver photograph. Library Company of Philadelphia. Gift of David Long.<br /> <br /> Trees on a much smaller scale were put up in Philadelphians' homes and also lovingly, if seemingly chaotically, decorated. Strands of beads, fans, dancing figures, and miniature parasols competed for attention with simpler ornaments. Additionally, elaborate model railroads and miniature village scenes adorned the spaces below many of the trees. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-richp9266865.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-richp9266865.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-richp9266865-thumb.jpg  width= 427  height= 570  /></a><br /> James B.

Gift of Matthew Schultz.<br /> <br /> Without their decorations, the trees themselves were rather forlorn looking specimens, lacking the fullness and triangular shape coveted by consumers today. Unless we were channeling our inner Charlie Brown, most of these trees would not be a part of our Christmas celebrations today.  The owners of these trees, however, did not attempt to hide their  bald spots,  nor did they cut off the trunk bottoms to make sure their trees did not touch the ceilings. They decorated them as they were, and proudly took photographs showing the results of their labors.<br /> <br /> <a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-danenhourp2013252.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-11-danenhourp2013252.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-11-danenhourp2013252-thumb.jpg  width= 335  height= 570  /></a><br /> F.

"'Exodus: Gods And Kings' - Grand! Truly the Most Epic Version of the Story of Moses"	"<center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Exodus.2014.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-Exodus.2014.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-Exodus.2014-thumb.jpg  width= 214  height= 318  /></a></center><br /> <br /> Ridley Scott has created quite an extraordinary adventure based on the Biblical story of Moses rising up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses and setting 600,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues. Starring Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton and Ben Kingsley, this film tells how one man's daring courage took on a mighty empire. Using state of the art visual effects and 3D imagery, Scott brings new life to this classic story. KIDS FIRST! Critic Gerry O. (age 12)  comments,  <em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> is a masterpiece that everybody should watch. This film combines a story about religion with a sense of history, while still having a touch of action, suspense and even a perfect sprinkle of romance.   Keefer B. (age 14) adds,  The landscape of this film is colossal! If you get a chance, watch this on the big screen. Some of you will wait and watch it on your phone or laptop but that does the film a huge disservice. Whether it's 3D or not, it's amazing when watching Egypt being built with swarms of people.

Critic, age 12<br /> <center> <iframe width= 560  height= 315  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/VVmCVqxm1og  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br /> <br /> Not only does this film teach you about one of the most important things in Jewish history, it tells one of the greatest stories history has to offer.<em> Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> is a masterpiece that everybody should watch. <br /> <br /> This film combines a story about religion with a sense of history, while still having a touch of action, suspense and even a perfect sprinkle of romance. <br /> <br /> This movie is about an Egyptian prince named Moses that gets exiled from Egypt when it is discovered that Moses is Hebrew (Jewish). After surviving through a long travel, he starts a new life, gets married and has a child. One day, he climbs a mountain that is known as God's mountain, where he gets knocked out and has an encounter with God who tells him to go to Egypt and free his people -- the Jewish slaves, and take them back to the promise land.<br /> <br /> This movie is stupendous! Of course it will appeal to Jewish people for this is a very big part of Jewish history, but I recommend this film for everybody. This tells a truly remarkable story about one man freeing four hundred thousand slaves from the Egyptian Empire with the help of what he believes to be God. While this is a whopping two hour long film, I didn't want it to end. This story is one that requires time to tell it and is truly inspiring. On a personal note, as a Jew, this film helped me understand my culture better and, in a way, to live through this journey with the characters. This film makes me want to do more and find out more about this part of history.  <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when Moses climbs this mountain that is known to be God's and, after getting knocked out when rocks fall on him, he wakes up to a bush on fire. A boy that turns out to be God is standing in front of him, building a small pyramid out of little stone cubes and telling Moses to free his people, implying free the Jewish people from Egypt. <br /> <br /> This movie is very mature. It takes a look at a very violent time in history. So, I would recommend it to ages 13 to 18. I also give it 5 out 5 stars for fantastic acting, directing, producing and breath-taking backgrounds and sets. If you have a chance to see this film in 3D, I strongly recommend it because the quality of the film is absolutely breathtaking. I hope that creators will continue with the rest of the books that are offered by Torah. <br /> <br /> <em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em><br /> Reviewed by Keefer C.B.<br /> <center><iframe width= 560  height= 315  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/RlZPezEQBxM  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br /> <br /> Grand! Truly the most epic version of this story. Moses( Christian Bale) goes through a journey of faith to set the slaves of Eygpt free from Pharaoh Rhamses (Joel Edgerton). <br /> <br /> The actors in this film are superb. From Edgerton's portrayal of arrogant Ramses to Ben Kingsley's portrayal as the wise and spiritual Nun. Every character has a distinct identity, especially my favorite character, Moses who goes through dynamic changes in this film thanks to an outstanding performance by Bale.   <br />       <br /> The landscape of this film is colossal! If you get a chance, watch this on the big screen. Some of you will wait and watch it on your phone or laptop but that does the film a huge disservice. Whether it's 3D or not, it's amazing when watching Egypt being built with swarms of people. The desert locations they chose set the tone of the film. The most monumental scene is when the slaves walk through the Red Sea. It's a race against time and tide that keeps you on the edge of you seat.  <br /> <br /> The story focus is on Moses' relationship with a higher power. Some of the best scene are him talking or arguing with God, who is portrayed as a little boy (Isaac Andrews). However, in the film this character is identified as Malak which is the Hebrew term for Angel. This raises questions,  Is he talking to God? Is Moses imagining these conversations? Could it be that the boy he is talking to represents himself?  Not only does this show how extraordinary the storytelling is, it also results in the audience coming to their own conclusions. That shows that you don't have to believe in a specific religion to enjoy this film. Which is an ambitious move on the director's part, but I'm glad they did it.  <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last conversation Moses has with Malak. This is when Moses write down the Ten Commandments. I adore this scene because it's a reflection of the journey that Moses went on. And, this is another great scene between Bale and Andrews.<br /> <br /> The message of this story is,  how far will you go for your faith.  God has had enough of seeing his people suffer so he sends nine plagues to make Ramses let his people go. Ramses retaliates by killing more Hebrews. There is so much death. It leads to one to side with doing something even worse. By the end, one side wins but, when you really think about it, how many people died to get there? <br /> <br /> I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 14 through 18-year-olds. This film contains extremely brutal images that most young kids won't be able to handle. It's necessary because the story focuses on showing the inhumanity of slavery. Other than that, check out this epic film in theaters December 12. <br /> <br /> <center><a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-GerryOrz.2014.LR.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-12-GerryOrz.2014.LR.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-GerryOrz.2014.LR-thumb.jpg  width= 379  height= 570  /></a></center><br /> Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

"Who Has the Answers?"	"You may know him as the man who wears many hats or for his work that dominated hip hop culture in the 90s and early 2000s. He is still working today with his shows  Sway in the Morning (radio) and  Off the Bat from the MLB Fan Cave  (television). Students and faculty of Syracuse University had the pleasure of hearing how Sway Calloway climbed the mountain to success on the evening of November 13, 2014.<br /> <br /> One of his many quotes that touched me was his advice for aspiring journalists, where he told us to  Create your own seat, because no one can duplicate it.  Sway has created his own seat in all areas of the industry since his beginnings as a rap artist in his teen years to becoming someone who has interviewed people across the spectrum from the Notorious B.I.G. to Jessica Alba. It obviously doesn't end here since he currently has a show on MTV and a show on Sirius XM. I have nothing but respect for this man. For someone of his caliber to have achieved all that he has, remained true to himself, and be so down to earth, is something to aspire to. Even when asked about how he feels about the success he has attained thus far, his response was,  I don't feel like I've made it, I feel like I'm working,  which shows that he doesn't believe that he is above anything and that he has to work just as hard to maintain his legacy as he did to obtain it.<br /> <br /> He is the epitome of how there isn't a set formula to achieve excellence. He didn't finish college, and was told that he would never be on radio, amongst other situations. Yet, he is one of the most powerful voices in the business. His life shows us that you do what you love, or as he said,  If you have something that you're passionate about, treat it extremely special.  With this said, don't do things because it is the societal norm or because it's the family tradition, work on a craft because YOU want it. This all comes down to self-worth and making sure that you  never compromise your integrity.  Only someone who has integrity would study the business  like it was the SAT,  and who follows their passion would turn down the chance to have a show on MTV three out of the four times it was offered to him. He just wouldn't be true to himself if he had taken up the offer the first three times, especially since he was already working on a show he had at the time.<br /> <br /> I can't possibly sum up all of the greatness I witnessed in one article, but I leave you two things. One, Sway definitely HAS the answers. Two, whether you want to be a singer, inventor, mathematician or a carpenter, you have to be  able to recognize opportunity and maximize it.

"Guess Which State Is About To Put Driver's Licenses On Smartphones"	"We’re creeping ever closer to a world in which you don’t need to carry a wallet.<br /> <br /> The state of Iowa will release a free smartphone app in 2015 that can be used in place of a physical driver’s license.

(It’s probably also a smart idea to continue to carry around your original license anyway, in case your smartphone battery dies.)<br /> <br /> <center><img alt= iowa  src= http://share.gifyoutube.com/Kdw8zq.gif  /></center><br /> <center><em>A mockup of the digital driver’s license. The head will actually move a little. <br /> (Source: Iowa.gov)</em></center><br /> <br /> Digital driver's licenses are just the latest thing moving out of our wallets and onto our phones. Money-transfer systems like <a href= https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/apple-pay/  target= _hplink >Apple Pay</a> and <a href= http://qz.com/277509/read-what-happens-when-a-bunch-of-over-30s-find-out-how-millennials-handle-their-money/  target= _hplink >Venmo</a> make it that much easier to survive without carrying cash or cards. <br /> <br /> The Iowa DOT is promoting the driver's license app as a way to eventually limit fraud of all sorts, including the production of fake IDs. People will verify their identity using a PIN code to open the app. <br /> <br /> The app is still very much in the development phase, Mark Lowe, director of the motor vehicle division for the Iowa DOT, told The Huffington Post. He noted that many of the security issues are getting worked out.<br /> <br /> Lowe said that one of the greatest concerns that the public has expressed about the idea is that law enforcement officers might ask to see someone’s driver’s license app, only to poke through other things on the smartphone. Officers aren’t legally allowed to do that, Lowe said. But to make sure people feel safe, they're creating a button that will allow officers to see the license without gaining access to anything else on the phone.<br /> <br /> Paul Steier, director of the Iowa Bureau of Investigation and Identity Protection, told HuffPost that the state may eventually allow people to only carry a digital license, doing away with their plastic card once and for all. <br /> <br /> “We see that as an option -- that someone could say I only want my driver’s license digitally, please,  Steier said.<br /> <br /> The app could also become much more than just a digital driver's license. The plan is to eventually integrate a number of other services into the app, like weather and driving alerts, or even the ability to access your personal record. <br /> <br /> H/T <a href= http://gizmodo.com/iowa-is-going-to-let-you-use-a-smartphone-as-your-drive-1669796842  target= _hplink >Gizmodo</a><br />  "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 15:32:35 -0500"	"teen"
"Are College Students Tempted To Sleep With A Hometown Ex During Breaks?"	"College students across the country are preparing to head home for winter break, and many of them will meet a dangerous temptation right in their hometown:  ex sex. <br /> <br /> What exactly is ex sex? Brown University sex columnist Margot Harris defined it in <a href= http://post.browndailyherald.com/2014/12/04/ex-sex/  target= _hplink >a piece last week</a> as  the sex that occurs after one breaks up with one's high school sweetheart and then comes back from college during one of the assorted breaks.  Research shows this isn't uncommon among young adults: <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/ex-sex-young-adults-study_n_2528856.html?1418410012  target= _hplink >one study found</a> nearly half of people ages 17 to 24 had gotten back together with an ex, and in more than half sex was part of the equation. <br /> <br /> But why exactly does a break from college and all its new and exciting potential conquests make us want to sleep with the old boyfriend or girlfriend we tossed out with our high school homework? HuffPost Live asked Harris and two other college sex columnists on Thursday about whether  ex sex  can ever be a good idea.<br /> <br /> <em>Watch that conversation in the video above, and <a href= http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/college-sex/546fb1f8fe344486d4000520  target= _hplink >click here</a> for the full HuffPost Live segment about sex and relationship trends on college campuses.</em><br /> <br /> <strong><a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/newsletter/huffpost-live  target= _hplink >Sign up here</a> for Live Today, HuffPost Live’s morning email that will let you know the newsmakers, celebrities and politicians joining us that day and give you the best clips from the day before!</strong> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 13:48:31 -0500"	"teen"

"Laci Green Reminds Us That Sexism Hurts Men Too"	"While sexism negatively affects women, <a href= https://twitter.com/gogreen18  target= _hplink >Laci Green</a> is here to remind us that <em>everyone</em> is impacted by gender inequality.  <br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/26/laci-green-mtv-braless-youtube_n_6214632.html?utm_hp_ref=making-it-work  target= _hplink >Green</a>, a sex-positive video blogger and peer sex educator, breaks down how sexism affects men and young boys in her video <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwQBlNVqL-E&list=PLTXiNEUzXWKT9xrbU3aUxqYloEL_W-8rr  target= _hplink > Does Sexism Hurt Men? </a> Her answer? Damn straight it does.  <br /> <br /> “Obviously, the fact that women and girls face inequalities is reason enough to stand up against sexism,  Green says.  But let’s not forget that sexism also affects men and boys.  <br /> <br /> Sexist conditioning tells men that the worst thing they can be is  like a woman  -- meaning being emotional, vulnerable or generally feminine. While none of these stereotypical gendered traits are actually bad (and don't ring true for all women), our culture pressures men to be the complete opposite, which can be just as hard as subscribing to the standards women face. <br />  <br /> As Green says in the clip, boys are told from a young age that they can't be emotional, they should be into sports and have  manly hobbies,  some of which include having lots of (heterosexual) sex to prove their manhood. While women are traditionally taught to stay at home as caregivers, men are told they need to be the sole breadwinners and leaders in their households. That's a lot of pressure for everyone. <br /> <br /> Sexism perpetuates “one version of masculinity, one way of being a real man that we impose on boys in a million subtle ways all throughout their lives and the effects of that are serious,  Green says. She also points out that out sexism affects gay men, lesbian women, trans* people and  everyone in between. <br /> <br /> “Understanding how these inequalities and attitudes permeate our society, and working to correct them, is in the best interest of everyone.” *Mic drop*<br /> <br /> <em>Head over to Green's YouTube channel <a href= https://www.youtube.com/user/lacigreen  target= _hplink >Sex+</a> for more information on sex-positive education. </em> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 11:53:47 -0500"	"teen"

"Facebook Basically Teasing Us With 'Dislike Button' At This Point"	"Facebook is considering adding a feature that <a href= http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/social.media/07/22/facebook.dislike.cashmore/index.html?_s=PM:TECH  target= _hplink >people have wanted</a> for a long time now: a  dislike  button. But don't hold your breath.<br /> <br /> CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, at <a href= https://www.facebook.com/qawithmark  target= _hplink >a public Q&A session</a> at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on Thursday, that the company has put a  great deal  of thought into adding a  dislike  button of some sort. <br /> <br />  You know, we're thinking about it,  Zuckerberg said. <br /> <br /> But he said he did not see the value in having a feature that would create up-or-down voting for people's Facebook posts, like what you see on Reddit. So don't expect to see something like this on the site any time soon:<br /> <br /> <img alt= facebook dislike  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2384250/thumbs/o-FACEBOOK-DISLIKE-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> Facebook is considering adding other buttons to express sentiment -- <a href= http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/01/facebook-considers-adding-the-hate-button/  target= _hplink >as it has done for years</a>. It has also been <a href= http://mashable.com/2010/07/23/facebook-dislike-button/  target= _hplink >thinking about</a> a  dislike  button for years, for that matter. <br /> <br /> But Facebook has no plan for creating additional buttons in the near future. The company has experimented with a <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/05/facebook-sympathize-button_n_4394451.html  target= _hplink > sympathize  button</a> and added easy-to-post <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/14/facebook-stickers-comments_n_5982546.html  target= _hplink >stickers</a>. There's even a <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/18/facebook-dislike-button_n_4468070.html  target= _hplink >thumbs down sticker</a>, but Facebook doesn't tally those the way it does  likes.  <br /> <br /> Zuckerberg acknowledged that people do want to express sentiments other than  liking,  especially when someone posts about a difficult issue.<br /> <br /> Expressing sentiment is already possible on Facebook: <br /> <br />  You know you can always comment,  Zuckerberg said -- though he admitted that clicking a button is easier than thinking up a witty comment.<br />  "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 11:09:42 -0500"	"teen"
"To Celebrate Taylor Swift's 25th Birthday, Here are 25 Things to Love About Her"	"These days, it seems everyone loves Taylor Swift. Her newest album <em>1989</em> sold 1.3 million copies in its first week and, all around the world, Swifties rejoiced. She's been everywhere lately: on talk shows, magazine covers and even on the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. <br /> <br /> But for those of you who are still skeptical about T-Swizzle, I've put together a list of twenty-five things to love about her in honor of her 25th birthday on December 13. <br /> <br /> <strong>1.</strong> She grew up on a Christmas tree farm. Seriously, I could stop right there. But I won't.<br /> <br /> <strong>2.</strong> She's 5'11  and rocks high heels everywhere she goes, even on stage. And she does it without hunching over like she's afraid of making other people feel small.<br /> <br /> <strong>3.</strong> She doesn't make other people feel small. In fact, she's notoriously kind, as evidenced by<a href= http://time.com/3273740/taylor-swift-instagram-comments-bullied-fan/  target= _hplink > the random notes of encouragement</a> she leaves her fans on their Instagram accounts,<a href= http://taylorswift.com/users/qne9EFrK/blogs/5324902  target= _hplink > that thirteen-hour meet and greet</a> where she gave as much attention to the last person as she did to the first, and her unwavering and outspoken <a href= http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/11/25/taylor-swift-supports-selena-gomez-crying-amas-performance/  target= _hplink >support</a> of women in her industry.<br /> <br /> <strong>4.</strong> <a href= http://time.com/3165825/taylor-swift-feminist-lena-dunham/  target= _hplink >She is a proud feminist</a> who doesn't shy away from calling out discrepancies in the way the media portrays male and female artists.<br /> <br /> <strong>5.</strong> She evolves. I don't care that you think she only writes about boys (see #4). Take a listen to her first album and compare it to <em>1989</em>. Hell, listen to her fourth album and compare it to <em>1989</em>. And it's not just her musical and personal style that has evolved; it's her view of the world and, most importantly, herself.<br /> <br /> <strong>6.</strong> She genuinely loves her fans and interacts with them on a daily basis. It's not uncommon for Taylor<a href= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2838730/Taylor-Swift-surprises-fan-sending-care-package-handwritten-notes-reading-tough-time.html  target= _hplink > to send random gift packages and handwritten notes to die-hard Swifties</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>7.</strong> SHE SENDS HANDWRITTEN NOTES. Who does that anymore? Taylor-effing-Swift, that's who.<br /> <br /> <strong>8.</strong> She has a sense of humor about how people view her romantic relationships. If you haven't watched <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ORhEE9VVg  target= _hplink >the  Blank Space  video</a>, now would be a good time.<br /> <br /> <strong>9.</strong> She embraces her sexuality without lowering her standards.<br /> <br /> <strong>10.</strong> She adores her family.<br /> <br /> <strong>11.</strong> <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFTa1KTnQ7E  target= _hplink >And her cats</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>12.</strong> She's a loyal friend who welcomes diversity in her closest relationships. Her besties include writer, actor and producer Lena Dunham, Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss, Selena Gomez, singer Ed Sheeran and her high school BFF Abigail Anderson.<br /> <br /> <strong>13.</strong> She sings live.<br /> <br /> <strong>14.</strong> She writes her own music.<br /> <br /> <strong>15.</strong> SHE WRITES HER OWN MUSIC.<br /> <br /> <strong>16.</strong> She stands up for her beliefs, even if they are unpopular.<a href= http://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-explains-why-she-left-spotify-2014-11  target= _hplink > She removed all her albums from Spotify </a>because she believes artists should be fairly compensated for their work. Because no matter how much money they've made in the past, IT IS STILL THEIR WORK (see #14 and #15).<br /> <br /> <strong>17.</strong> She is an incredibly savvy businesswoman who isn't afraid of taking big risks. When everyone told her that a pop album was a bad idea, particularly a pop album with a strange name and only half of Taylor's face showing on the cover, she did it anyway. You do you, Taylor.<br /> <br /> 18. She is humble about her success and <a href= http://time.com/3578249/taylor-swift-interview/  target= _hplink >openly appreciative of the platform it has given her to influence others</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>19.</strong> Can we just talk about her hair for a second? <br /> <br /> <strong>20.</strong> She handles awkward situations with style and class. She didn't bash Kanye West for stealing her thunder and acting like a petulant child. <a href= http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/taylor-swift-sings-about-kanye-at-vmas-we-can-be-friends--2010129  target= _hplink >She sang a song to him about forgiveness and grace</a>. <br /> <br /> <strong>21.</strong> <a href= http://greatideas.people.com/2014/06/17/taylor-swift-ina-garten-cooking-lesson/  target= _hplink >She cooks</a>. <br /> <br /> 22. She knows that life is filled with ups and downs, and she is vocal about taking her challenges and using them to grow. <br /> <br /> <strong>23.</strong> She's quirky and silly and finds joy in the small things, which is incredibly refreshing to see in someone who was <a href= http://www.forbes.com/profile/taylor-swift/  target= _hplink >ranked #18 on Forbes Celebrity 100 in June of this year</a>, worth an estimated $64 million.<br /> <br /> <strong>24.</strong> She enjoys being single and stated in a recent interview that <blockquote>You can have love all around you without being in love, and find romance in your everyday life without being in a romantic relationship. That can be just as fulfilling.</blockquote> <br /> <br /> <em>*slow clap*</em><br /> <br /> <strong>25</strong>. She doesn't do things for shock value. Instead, she focuses on constantly improving her art and building connections with the people who matter most: her family, her friends and her fans.<br /> <br /> Happy Birthday Taylor!

Peterson, the 2012 NFL MVP, was <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/18/adrian-peterson-suspended_n_6177578.html  target= _hplink >suspended without pay for at least the remainder of the 2014 season</a> on Nov. 18 for violations of the league's Personal Conduct Policy after <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/adrian-peterson-child-abuse-plea_n_6102284.html  target= _hplink >pleading no contest to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault</a> for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son.<br /> <br /> With support from the NFLPA, <a href= http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/11/20/adrian-peterson-appeal-nfl-players-association/19320665/  target= _hplink >Peterson appealed that suspension</a>, which indicated he could not be considered for reinstatement until April 2015. After the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/12/adrian-peterson-appeal-denied_n_6317828.html  target= _hplink >denial of his appeal</a> by NFL-appointed arbiter Harold Henderson on Friday, Peterson told ESPN that he had  considered real estate and a bid for the 2016 Olympics in the 200-meter and 400-meter events as fallback options.<br /> <br />  I've considered retiring from the NFL,  Peterson <a href= http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12021489/adrian-peterson-minnesota-vikings-disappointed-nfl-disciplinary-process-thought-retirement  target= _hplink >told ESPN</a>.  I still made $8 million dollars this year. I've thought about getting back into the real estate [business in Texas] I'm already in. That's something I've been interested in, something I'm involved in. I've thought about getting back into that. I've thought about going after the Olympics -- you only live once. It might be time for me to pursue that, as well. I love playing football, don't get me wrong, but this situation is deeper than that. For me, it's like, 'Why should I continue to be a part of an organization or a business that handles players the way they do? Making money off the field anyway, why not continue to pursue that (Olympic) dream and pursue other dreams and hang up the cleats?' <br /> <br /> Peterson has been an <a href= http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PeteAd01.htm  target= _hplink >elite NFL player</a> since being drafted out of Oklahoma in 2007, but lining up alongside world-class sprinters would be a very different challenge for the 29-year-old. <br /> <br />  Peterson is delusional if he thinks he has any chance of being a track and field Olympian,  <a href= http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/12/13/adrian-peterson-maybe-ill-retire-from-the-nfl-run-in-the-olympics/  target= _hplink >wrote Michael David Smith of ProFootballTalk</a> on Saturday.  Yes, Peterson is very fast by the standards of a normal human being, and even by the standards of an NFL player. No, Peterson is nowhere near as fast as an Olympic sprinter. If Peterson is serious about trying to qualify for the Olympics, he’d have a better chance at a more specialized sport like the bobsled. <br /> <br /> In a <a href= https://twitter.com/NFLPA/status/543534419815182336  target= _hplink >statement issued shortly after Peterson's appeal was denied</a>, the NFLPA indicated that the fight over Peterson's suspension was not over:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL. The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.</blockquote><br /> <br /> Citing an unnamed person with direct knowledge of the situation, the Associated Press reported that <a href= http://bigstory.ap.org/article/f6ffe7554c324c1e8e2167a2fb80783a/still-suspended-adrian-petersons-appeal-denied  target= _hplink >Peterson will continue his fight to return to football by filing a complaint against the NFL in federal court</a> as early as Monday. <br /> <br /> Peterson participated in the Vikings' opening game of the 2014 season before being <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/adrian-peterson-child-injury-indicted_n_5813210.html  target= _hplink >indicted in the child injury case</a> on Sept. 12. The Vikings then <a href= http://www.vikings.com/news/article-1/Statement-From-the-Minnesota-Vikings/fb9cab0c-9748-495a-ab74-9a86040cb673?campaign=social_20140917_31766716  target= _hplink >placed him on the Exempt/Commissioner’s Permission</a> list on Sept. 17, barring him from team activities until his legal proceedings were resolved.

Here are 10 things that I learned:<br /> <br /> 1.  Oakland Mayor <strong>Jean Quan</strong> was there personally requesting cash and toy donations for  Toys for Tots. <br /> <br /> 2.  <strong>Kevin McHale</strong>, former Boston Celtic is the head coach of the Houston Rockets.  Now he was been the head coach for two years, but I was unaware of it until now.<br /> <br /> 3.  <strong>A.C. Green</strong>, former Los Angels Laker was at the game.  I saw him in the media credential line.  Not sure why he was there.<br /> <br /> 4.  There is a pronunciation guide in the game notes which includes this guide for <strong>Stephen Curry</strong>: STEFF IN CURRY<br /> <br /> 5.   Curry is the flavor of the month,  as Stephen Curry is the Western Conference player of the month for the third time.<br /> <br /> 6.  <strong>Ruby Lopez</strong> the in-arena host for the Golden State Warriors is a mom, with a 2-month-old baby.<br /> <br /> 7.  It was their 91st consecutive home sellout.<br /> <br /> 8.  Their record is 19-2 with a lucky 13 win streak, the most in the franchises 69 year old history.<br /> <br /> 9.  In the 2013 playoffs the following words were on the back of the Warriors t-shirts:  strong, proud, loud, battle, unite, fierce, protect, and defend.<br /> <br /> 10.

"Floyd Mayweather Jr. Says He Wants To Fight Manny Pacquiao On May 2"	"<p>Floyd Mayweather Jr. says he's ready to fight Manny Pacquiao next May in a long anticipated bout that would be the richest ever in boxing.</p><br />               <p>Mayweather called for negotiations for the fight to be take place, though he warned Pacquiao not to expect to get anywhere near the money that he himself would make.</p><br />               <p> You lost twice and now you're coming back begging for the same money?  Mayweather asked.  That's not gonna happen. </p><br />               <p>In an interview on the Showtime network from a fight card he was promoting in San Antonio, Mayweather for the first time called for the fight to happen and even gave a date — May 2. He claimed it wasn't him but Pacquiao's promoter, Bob Arum, who has been the main obstacle for not making the fight in the last five years.</p><br />               <p> Floyd Mayweather is not ducking or dodging any opponent,  Mayweather said.  Bob Arum is stopping the fight. We have been trying to make this fight happen for many years behind the scene. </p><br />               <p>Pacquiao turned the pressure up on Mayweather to make the fight last month, saying the time had come to put on the much anticipated bout. Arum said he had also been in talks with CBS Corp. chairman Les Moonves about the fight.</p><br />               <p>CBS operates Showtime, which has Mayweather under contract for two more fights in May and September.</p><br />               <p>Mayweather repeated his old charges about Pacquiao not wanting to do blood tests prior to the fight for it not happening five years ago. He also said he offered Pacquiao $40 million for a bout, but he refused.</p><br />               <p>Mayweather, who hasn't lost in 47 fights, said he was confident he could beat Pacquiao and eager to star in an extremely lucrative fight.</p><br />               <p> I know that he's not on my level,  Mayweather said.  The fan would love to see the fight. And, of course, I want to go out with a bang. </p><br />               <p>No one knows how rich a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight would be, coming so late after it first should have happened in 2009. There are some who think both fighters have slipped some with advancing age, but there's no doubt that the fight still holds tremendous appeal.</p><br />               <p>It would likely gross at least $250 million, and Mayweather's purse alone would be more than $100 million.</p><br />               <p>Mayweather was not asked in the ringside interview about the murder-suicide of rapper Earl Warren Hayes and his wife in Los Angeles on Monday. Police spoke to Mayweather after the killings following media reports that he may have spoken to Hayes before he shot Stephanie Elyse Moseley and then took his own life in their apartment.</p> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 00:26:00 -0500"	"sports"
"After Honoring Eric Garner, LeBron's Voice Could Have Been Louder"	"Last Saturday, during the Chicago Bulls' pregame warmup against the steaming-hot Golden State Warriors, Derrick Rose wore a T-shirt displaying the words  I Can't Breathe.  It was a reference to the recent non-indictment of a NYPD police officer in the choking death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, in Staten Island. Garner's last words were  I can't breathe. <br /> <br />  That night we talked about how we supported [Rose],  teammate Tim Flowers <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/sports/basketball/derrick-rose-sees-taking-a-stand-in-eric-garner-case-as-his-responsibility.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >told <em>The New York Times</em></a>. Rose and Flowers were childhood friends who grew up together on the South Side of Chicago. Flowers added that  wearing the shirt was an important thing to do,  calling it  a responsibility.  <br /> <br /> Rose's effort to bring awareness to the ongoing issue of unarmed black men dying at the hands of police officers trickled down to the rest of the league, with many players following suit over subsequent nights. Even Kobe Bryant, who is often ridiculed for not publicly stating his opinions on major issues, partook in the demonstration along with some of his Lakers teammates. <br /> <br /> But this is now LeBron James' league, and there isn't a name that permeates our sports experience like his does. Both James and Kyrie Irving also decided to make a statement, wearing  I Can't Breathe  T-shirts over their jerseys prior to their conference matchup against the Brooklyn Nets. <br /> <br /> After the game James was asked his reason for wearing the T-shirt, and he <a href= http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2014/12/09/james-kyrie-nets-in-i-cant-breathe-shirts/20116207/  target= _hplink >responded</a>,  It was a message to the family. That I'm sorry for their loss, sorry to his wife. That's what it's about.  He went on to say,  I think everybody else gets caught up in everything else besides who's really feeling it, and that's the family. That's what it's about. <br /> <br /> Those statements aren't easy to hear. For once, LeBron James -- the anti-Michael Jordan in every way, no matter how much we try to compare the two -- sounded very Jordan-esque. It appears that James was more interested in playing it safe, unwilling to ruffle the feathers of his corporate sponsors and brands.<br /> <br /> By wearing the shirt he was making a statement just like his signature  tomahawk  dunk. However, his post-game press conference offered a different sound byte -- echoing his 2011 NBA Finals appearance. He was fading into the corner, scared to bring out the brute presence and talent he casts on his opponents on the court. He backtracked, only looking at the killings of unarmed black men from a surface-level perspective. One can't wave the baton of injustice and represent the voice of the unheard yet retract his or her true sentiments when under judgment and pressure from others. <br /> <br /> James knows that by wearing the shirt, he was carrying the weight of a culture and a community that is systemically treated as inferior through the education system, the prison-industrial complex, etc. To James' credit, he has been very vocal on a number of social issues, most notably on the Trayvon Martin killing when he and his then-teammates <a href= http://grantland.com/features/trayvon-martin-miami-heat-talk-talk-hoodies/  target= _hplink >posed for a photo with their hoodies covering their heads</a>. He is widely admired in is hometown of Akron, Ohio, as a person who constantly gives back to his community and leads by example. <br /> <br /> However, in this particular instance James dodged. Toward the end of his post-game press conference, one of the reporters asked James if there was a larger message, beyond what he'd just said, that should be considered. Sounding almost frustrated, James responded,  How much larger can it be than to just pay respects to the family?  <br /> <br /> LeBron James usually expresses his opinions on social issues, particularly those dealing with his own community, a little bit better. But in this one instance, I hope he will revisit his perspective. "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 00:25:53 -0500"	"sports"
"Babe Lincoln, Amelia Armheart, Ruth Hater Ginsburg : Ladies Who Arm Wrestle"	"<em><a href= http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/12/03/katrina_arnold_photographs_new_orleans_ladies_arm_wrestling_tournaments.html  target= _hplink >This post originally appeared on Slate.<br /> </a></em><strong>By Jordan G. Teicher</strong><br /> <br /> <img alt= arm  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2387510/thumbs/o-ARM-900.jpg  /><br /> <center><small>The Cosmic Crusher and Grandmaw Foots face off in the final match.</small><br /> </center><br /> <br /> When Katrina Arnold photographed a ladies arm wrestling brawl in New Orleans a few years ago, she was instantly hooked. The raucous events, which are hosted by <a href= http://nolaw.org/  target= _hplink >New Orleans Ladies Arm Wrestling</a>, combine the performative, athletic elements of a WWE match with the communal, boozy aspects of a trivia night. It’s one of more than 25 chapters across the world under the umbrella of the<a href= http://www.clawusa.org/the-leagues/  target= _hplink > Collective of Lady Arm Wrestlers. </a><br /> <br /> “They're such colorful events. You never know what's going to happen,” Arnold said. “I got addicted. I ended up joining the collective and taking pictures of my friends.”<br /> <br /> At NOLAW’s events, which are held a few times a year at bars, galleries, and other spaces across the city, eight arm wrestlers—each with their own costumed persona, theme song, and entourage—compete before hundreds of spectators. According to NOLAW, “rules are determined and managed by the referee, only to be manipulated and corrupted by celebrity judges, crowd hecklers, and dolla billz.”<br /> <br /> The events aren’t just fun and games. They’re also fundraisers, with all proceeds benefiting local groups supporting women and children. (The groups, in return, create the winner’s trophy and submit a member to wrestle in the tournament.)<br /> <br /> Photographing arm wrestling, Arnold said, is like photographing a concert: It involves shooting fast-moving subjects in low light, as well as avoiding getting in the way of audience members. Still, she said, NOLAW’s events are “a photographer’s dream.” Hilarious wrestler alter egos—Babe Lincoln, Amelia Armheart, Ruth Hater Ginsburg—come with equally outrageous costumes and stunts as they prepare to compete. Half-time acts include drag queens and burlesque dancers. Crowds are loud and enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> “We want to create a fun, safe atmosphere where we can show off these strong, empowered women doing something that allows them to act out however they want,” she said. “You can be sexy, strong funny—you create a character. The best part is seeing these expressions come out on stage. It's more about performance than the actual arm wrestling.”<br /> <br /> Arnold’s photographs will be on display in the exhibition, “Katrina Arnold: Wrists Up” at New Orleans’ Gradoux Gallery as part of PhotoNOLA from Dec. 4 through Dec. 7.<br /> <br /> <em><a href= http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/12/03/katrina_arnold_photographs_new_orleans_ladies_arm_wrestling_tournaments.html  target= _hplink >See more photos on Slate.</a></em> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 21:10:25 -0500"	"sports"
"Adrian Peterson's Appeal Denied, Arbitrator Upholds NFL's Suspension"	"Adrian Peterson won't likely be back in an NFL game any time soon.

The suspension stemmed from a child injury case involving Peterson and his 4-year-old son. Peterson was <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/adrian-peterson-child-injury-indicted_n_5813210.html  target= _hplink >indicted in September</a> and eventually <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/adrian-peterson-child-abuse-plea_n_6102284.html  target= _hplink >pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge</a> of reckless assault for using a wooden switch to discipline the child.<br /> <br /> Henderson's decision to uphold the NFL's suspension means that Peterson cannot apply for reinstatement until April 15, 2015. <br /> <br /> The <a href= https://twitter.com/NFLPA/status/543534419815182336  target= _hplink >NFL Players Association issued a statement</a> shortly after the decision was announced, taking issue with the ruling and choice of a <a href= http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/11/21/union-questions-harold-hendersons-neutrality/  target= _hplink >former league executive</a> as arbitrator in the case. <br /> <br /> <blockquote>The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL. The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.</blockquote><br /> <br /> Peterson's next move could be to take his appeal to federal court, <a href= https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/543530591065751552  target= _hplink >reported Ian Rapoport of NFL.com</a>. <br /> <br /> <strong>MORE FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: </strong><br /> <br /> <blockquote>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An arbiter appointed by the NFL ruled Friday that Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson will remain suspended until at least next spring in the child-abuse case that has sidelined him for all but one game this season.<br /> <br /> The decision by Harold Henderson, a former league official, upheld the NFL's decision last month to suspend Peterson without pay for the remainder of the season and not consider him for reinstatement before April 15.<br /> <br /> Peterson was paid during his appeal, but Henderson's ruling means Peterson will forfeit checks from the team's last six games. That amounts to a fine of more than $4.1 million.<br /> <br /> The NFL Players Association called Henderson's objectivity into question and said it was  considering immediate legal remedies  to the decision.<br /> <br />  The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL,  the union said in a statement.  The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. <br /> <br /> The Vikings declined to comment. Peterson is a three-time, first-team Associated Press All-Pro and reached the Pro Bowl in six of his first seven NFL seasons, all with Minnesota. Peterson led the NFL in rushing twice, including 2012 when his 2,097 yards fell 9 short of breaking Eric Dickerson's all-time record, but he may never play again for the Vikings after this mess.<br /> <br /> Peterson was charged with felony child abuse in September for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son, but he pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault in November. He had been on paid leave, on a special exempt list at the discretion of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, while his case moved through the court system.<br /> <br /> <br /> At the crux of the NFLPA's argument for reinstatement was what NFL executive vice president for football operations Troy Vincent told Peterson last month when the dispute was at its height. According to a person with knowledge of the conversation, Vincent told Peterson he would receive a two-game ban if he attended a hearing on Nov. 14 with Goodell.<br /> <br /> Peterson declined to meet that day with Goodell, citing uncertainty about the NFL's intent to question him. Goodell then announced on Nov. 18 that Peterson would be suspended for the six games that remained for the Vikings at the time and not be considered for reinstatement until April.<br /> <br /> A recording and a transcript of what Vincent told Peterson was presented by the NFLPA to Henderson, who oversaw a hearing on Dec. 2. Peterson attended that and listened via telephone as the hearing continued on Dec. 4, when Vincent was questioned.<br /> <br /> The union and league have been sniping at each other over the personal-conduct policy since former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice's case eventually prompted Goodell to upgrade the penalty for a first offense of assault, battery or domestic violence to a six-game suspension. After first suspending Rice for two games, Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely amid a national furor over his initial leniency.<br /> <br /> Rice's appeal, however, went to a neutral arbiter who ruled in his favor and reinstated him.<br /> <br /> Peterson injured his son when the boy visited him in May at his home in the Houston area. Peterson acknowledged physically disciplining the boy as he had been as a youth, but said he meant no harm and was sorry for the trouble he caused. Peterson reached a no-contest plea agreement in Texas on Nov. 4, reducing the charge to misdemeanor reckless assault for probation time, community service and a small fine.<br /> <br />  I love my son more than any of you can imagine,  he said outside the courthouse that day.<br /> <br /> The Vikings (6-7) have three games remaining. They initially announced Peterson would stay on the active roster after the first game he missed following the indictment on Sept. 13, but they reversed course less than two days later following intense public pressure and placed him on the exempt list.<br /> <br /> Peterson's current contract runs through 2017, but that's not guaranteed like the other major sports. The Vikings could release him before next season and owe him nothing and take only a $2.4 million hit on their 2015 salary cap, the remaining prorated portion of the signing bonus he received on Sept. 10, 2011.</blockquote> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 18:33:41 -0500"	"sports"

"Five Wins in a Row, Manchester United Week 15 Recap"	"Coming into the weekend matchup, Manchester United, sitting in fourth place, played third place Southampton. Southampton was one point ahead of the Red Devils, but currently in a big slide from their early season form, with two losses and a draw in their last three matches. United were keen on taking advantage of Southampton's poor form and extending their winning streak to five games in a row.<br /> <br /> United fielded another new compilation of players due to their serious bout with injuries, but this time they played in Van Gaal's desired 3-5-2 formation.  David De Gea started in goal. Center backs Chris Smalling, Marcos Rojo, and Paddy McNair formed the three-man backline. Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia adopted left and right wingback positions, respectively. Juan Mata, Michael Carrick, and Marouane Fellaini formed the central midfield, and Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie were the front men. They faced a Southampton side, recently beleaguered with injuries as well, missing key midfielders Morgan Schneiderlin and Jack Cork. <br /> <br /> Southampton jumped out to a wonderful start, controlling the game's tempo and a majority of the possession. The possession, however, lead to few early chances and the game remained a draw at 0-0. A lapse in their defense would prove key in the game's first offensive chance.  After, a Wayne Rooney dribble was edged out by the defense, defender, Jose Fonte, played a back pass to his goalkeeper without looking to assure the pass was open. Robin Van Persie, observant of the defender's mistake, broke into a sprint, stealing the pass before it reached the keeper. With his second touch, he passed the ball through the keeper's legs and into the net. United were up 1-0 in the 12th minute. Shortly after, some worry arose for United. Chris Smalling sat down on the field, unable to continue. Jonny Evans replaced Smalling just 18 minutes into the match. <br /> <br /> Southampton did not let the goal stymy their efforts; in fact, they set about getting an equalizer with renewed purpose. To make matters even worse for United, the new back line played even more nervous. In the 31st minute, they were rewarded. After, a dangerous dribble into the United box and deflections in front of the goal, the ball fell to Southampton forward Graziano Pelle. He drove the ball past David De Gea for the game's equalizer. The goal was David De Gea's only blemish all game as he continued his spectacular form throughout the remaining minutes, especially on another Pelle chance, which he parried wide of the goal. In the 35th minute, Paddy McNair made an error on a clearance, hitting it far short and into a dangerous position right in front of Southampton winger, Shane Long. Long sent the resulting chance far over the bar, but the mistake provided manager Louis Van Gaal enough reason to substitute the youngster a few minutes later for Ander Herrera. Herrera entered the game with several instructions to reshape the United side, including a pivotal swap of Michael Carrick from midfield to defense. The instructions were not delivered clearly and through the remainder of the first half, United played confused and extremely nervous, barely able to see the 1-1 draw through to half.<br /> <br /> United returned more confident from the halftime, but the game's pulse was still driven by Southampton's play. They still controlled possession and the attempts to get into scoring positions. David De Gea came up big again with a tremendous save on a Shane Long header. United would need another Southampton mistake to make an imprint on the game. In the 71st minute, their moment arrived. They received a free kick for a needless foul. Wayne Rooney stood over the ball and curled a magically weighted ball toward the right post and even more, towards Robin Van Persie. He volleyed the ball with the outside of his left foot straight down in between the goalie's legs again. With that touch, United retook the lead.<br /> <br /> De Gea faced another chance from Pelle in the 76th minute, which he repelled skillfully away from any Southampton players seeking a rebound tap-in to equalize.  With some strict attention to defense, United were able to finish the game without conceding and grab the three points needed to place them in 3rd place, 5 points shy of 2nd place, and 8 shy of 1st. <br /> <br /> United will ride high on the result of the match against Southampton, but should be cautious of their actual form in the victory. The defense and midfield looked nervous in defense and possession and their forward line got few touches as a result. Robin Van Persie turned in another sparkling performance, which could signal his return to 2012 form.  David De Gea contributed another gem as goalkeeper.  Paddy McNair's prompt substitution could jostle his confidence, although Van Gaal insinuates a mutual understanding between the two that it will not. United add Chris Smalling to their long list of injured players, including Ángel Di María, Luke Shaw, Daley Blind, Rafael, Phil Jones, and Jesse Lingard. Still, United must press on and continue their winning run. United will play Liverpool next in a rivalry match of the Premiership's two most historically successful teams on Sunday, December 14th. The game will be aired on NBC Sports Network at 8:30AM EST. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 17:38:47 -0500"	"sports"
"Obama Opts For ESPN Over Cable News In The Morning"	"President Barack Obama does not start his mornings off by devouring the latest political headlines from CNN, Fox News or MSNBC. No, the president gets enough of that during the day. Instead, like so many American's seeking solace from reports of war, disease and government gridlock, Obama turns to ESPN.  <br /> <br /> On Friday, during an interview with Colin Cowherd on ESPN Radio's  The Herd,  the president -- between plugging the Affordable Care Act and mentioning the importance of professional athletes speaking out on critical issues -- made sure he let listeners know just how much he loves watching sports. <br /> <br /> “I spend most of my time watching ESPN in the morning,” Obama said, adding that he watches  Sports Center  while working out. “I get so much politics I don’t want to be inundated with a bunch of chatter about politics during the day.”<br /> <br /> In October, former White House press secretary <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/27/jay-carney-obama-cable-news-printed-word_n_6054190.html  target= _hplink >Jay Carney divulged</a> that Obama doesn't bother watching the big cable news channels, but he somehow failed to mention that  Sports Center  makes up the majority of the president's morning news diet.

"Marathon Man: Will Boston Billy Rodgers Ever Stop Running?"	"Just 40 years ago, when Bill Rodgers won his first Boston Marathon, running was considered a bizarre thing to do. Truckers threw beer cans at runners' heads.  <br /> <br /> Employers wouldn't let workers go for a run at lunchtime.  Women seldom ran marathons and were barely welcome at the Boston. <br /> <br /> Marathons lacked mile markers, water stops, and porta-potties, and... runners.  The '75 Boston featured only 2,000 runners, compared with 30,000 today.  <br /> <br /> Back then, the New York City Marathon consisted of four loops inside Central Park.  And Nike was barely a waffle-shaped gleam in the eye of Phil Knight.  <br /> <br /> Suddenly, a handful of long distance runners -- Frank Shorter, Jim Fixx, Alberto Salazar, Jack Fultz, and Bill Rodgers -- captured the nation's imagination and inspired the running boom which continues to this day.<br /> <br /> Rodgers, one of America's most beloved athletes, and still a free spirit at 67, has just written a memoir, <em>Marathon Man</em>, describing his experiences training for and winning the 1975 Boston Marathon.  <br /> <br /> He wore a pair of ill-fitting running proto-Nikes he'd received in the mail from his friend, fellow legend Steve Prefontaine, and once he knew he had the race in the bag, around mile 20, he actually stopped running to tie his shoe.<br /> <br /> Rodgers spoke to me about how marathoning has changed over the years, and how marathoning changed his life.<br /> <br /> <strong>What makes the Boston Marathon unique?<br /> </strong><br /> It is more fun than any other race, and it's a race that people want to do over and over.  I hate to use the word addictive, but there is something different about Boston.  It's the oldest yearly marathon in the world.  Maybe it's because Boston isn't as big as New York, Chicago, or L.A., so it fits the city a little bit better.  It overtakes the city.  I've met a lot of runners over the years who say,  My father ran the marathon,  or even  My grandfather ran the marathon.   I love that.<br /> <br /> <strong>The weather's so unpredictable.  You can be running in thirty-mile-an-hour headwinds, you can be running in ninety-degree heat. <br /> </strong><br /> That's part of the charm of Boston -- you don't know what you're going to get.  That's the way all marathons were, but now they're all geared for faster times and cooler weather.  New York was in September, then late October, and now it's the first week of November.  Tokyo is in February.  Berlin is in late September.   <br /> <br /> Boston hasn't changed, which is charming -- but when you're running it, it might not be so charming.  Race directors want to attract the maximum number of entrants, and the thing that attracts people to a race is making it as easy as possible to set a new personal best.  There's a push to make the marathon an easier event, which is smart.  I ran New York when it was in September.  It was ninety degrees!  That's why marathon running was not very popular. <br /> <br /> <strong>When you knew you had the '75 Boston won, about six miles from the finish line, you actually stopped running to tie your shoe.<br /> </strong><br /> That's true.  I wish I knew exactly where it was.  I had fun at Boston.  It became my favorite race.  I can remember thinking that if I could win and get that medal, it would be so great.  What's unique about Boston is that everyone has that feeling.  <br /> <br /> Running is more than a sport.  A sport is just a sport -- just a win or a loss.  This is ten trillion times more.  Everyone struggles at Boston, which is maybe why that medal means so much.  <br /> <br /> <strong>In Marathon Man you talk about eating a lot of sweets and junk food as part of your training regimen.<br /> </strong><br /> It was just a sign of the times.  When we were traveling from race to race, we'd go back to a hotel afterwards and our celebration was getting a big bowl of nuts or chips with cheese.  We didn't think about nutrition like the professional runners today.  Frank Shorter and I were a little bit closer to the earlier Boston Marathon winners, the Johnny Kelleys and Clarence Demars, than to runners of the present day. <br /> <br /> My diet today is a little healthier than it used to be, but I still like my snacks, pumpkin pies, and all that.  I think people just know more now, which has played a role in runners getting quicker and helping more people to become runners. <br /> <br /> <strong>When you were training for the 1975 Boston Marathon, you were able to incorporate running into a fairly normal existence -- you had a full-time job and a girlfriend.<br /> </strong><br /> One of the myths about running is that you can't live a normal life if you're going to be a marathoner.  I think to some extent that for elite runners, that's true.  Their lives are kind of severe.  <br /> <br /> Back then we were winging it.  We ran a lot of miles, but we had a lot of fun too.  We ate what we wanted.  Grabbing a bunch of chocolate chip cookies after dinner and having them for dessert was part of the game.  That's probably not true for today's elite runners.     <br /> <br /> <strong>Do you miss the purity of the sport? Is there something that's lost with the commercialization of it, and the popularization?<br /> </strong><br /> It's not lost if the race leadership doesn't want it to get lost.  The race directors in Boston are handling the competitive racing side very well for the professional runners, but they've also kept a place for the Johnny Kelleys of today, the amateurs who run because they love to.  The door got wider, especially when the fundraising side came in and when women came into the sport.  <br /> <br /> Women made it a family sport.<br /> <br /> Today we have the Rock 'n' Roll Marathons, so there's more of a fun side to the sport, and that's very powerful.  Sports have definitely changed, but the Boston course is always the same.  That's what I like about Boston.  When you run Boston's course, you ran where Greta Weitz ran -- and Joan Benoit, Ingrid Kristiansen, and Clarence DeMar.<br /> <br /> <strong>And you.<br /> </strong><br /> That's true.<br /> <br /> <strong>When you won in '75, your  prize  was a bowl of beef stew.<br /> </strong><br /> I remember when they were debating about whether to have prize money at the Boston Marathon.  I talked to Tommy Leonard, the founder of the Falmouth Road Race, and said,  Oh, it should be wide open.  They shouldn't have qualifying times unless 100,000 people want to run.   There's a tremendous sum of good that comes out of the marathon.  Every runner has a story.<br /> <br /> <strong>How do you feel about the fundraising aspect of marathoning? <br /> </strong><br /> The fundraising side has turned out to be absolutely spectacular.  Not too long ago, no one would have thought that someone would put money forward for a runner to run a marathon.  It would be a joke -- like George Plimpton running the Boston Marathon.  Running a marathon is a great challenge, a quest, but people say to themselves,  I can complete it because I'm doing it to fight cancer or Alzheimer's disease.   Everyone has a personal reason to be there, and that's powerful.   <br /> <br /> When I travel to races around the country, people tell me that they don't think they'll ever be able to run the Boston Marathon, or that they can't run fast enough to qualify.  I say,  Yes, you can.  You just have to link up with an organization that you have a connection with.  For example, everyone has a connection to fighting cancer. <br /> <br /> Running is the number one sport for individual fundraising.  Football, baseball, and golf are all very charitable, but that's all on the corporate level.  When it comes to charitable giving, running might be bigger, partly because running is more global than almost any sport.  All of these cool things are happening now, which makes it a better sport than ever.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Do you still attend the Boston Marathon?<br /> </strong><br /> I still go in for the race, and I love it.  It's one of my favorite days.  It's like all the holidays combined.  It's just so much fun to see everyone smiling at a marathon.  Everyone is in a good mood.  Maybe they're struggling a little at the end, but people are smiling.  They're with their family and friends.  It's hard to beat. <br /> <br /> There are more of us older runners than ever before.  I love that, but I also love to see the young people in their twenties.  American youth are often criticized, but they're running marathons and they're raising funds.  I love seeing that. <br /> <br /> <strong>Tell me why you wrote Marathon Man.<br /> </strong><br /> When I initially spoke with my coauthor, Matt Shepatkin, I was a little bit nervous.  I said,  No one's going to want to read this.   He is not a runner.  It was funny as heck, because he had no knowledge of intervals, speed work, or Heartbreak Hill, but he was a very good writer, and we had a lot of fun.  <br /> <br /> I've gotten a lot of great feedback about the book.  I like that we included running with my brothers Charlie and Jason.  That's what it is really about -- becoming a runner.  You might quit if you don't have a focus or if you don't run with your family or friends.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Before the running boom you helped create, running was disrespected.<br /> </strong><br /> I was a special education teacher so that I could have time to train for Boston.  My first year, they wouldn't even let me run on my lunch hour.  My second year, they said yes.  That enabled me to make the Olympic team.  <br /> <br /> Olympic sports, like cycling, running, and swimming, are changing our society and I think employers see that now.  They are building bike paths around their corporate parks and encourage basketball or walking.  It's great.<br /> <br /> I think running is changing.  It's a lifestyle sport, it's a lifetime sport, and it's a health and fitness sport.  Plus, if you're active, you sleep better, food tastes better; life is better in so many ways. <br /> <br /> <strong>Are there more marathons in you?  <br /> </strong> <br /> For years, I would run every race I went to, but now it's more about going to the expo at each race, where I meet the runners.  Since I'm older and have been at races so long, I don't want to run every race.  I get almost as much out of it by seeing the runners go by.  When I was at Philadelphia, Mayor Nutter actually gave high fives to all 30,000 runners. <br /> <br /> A lot of my friends still train for Boston, but most of them are younger.  From age 25 to age 40, I did 50 marathons.  That's a lot of traveling and racing.  When I hit 40, I did some more marathons, but I started to lose my drive for it.  As you get older, everything shifts gears.  You start to say,  Well, I'll do a half marathon, and that's my marathon now.   You start thinking of your health, and you want to back off a little.   <br /> <br /> During the first running boom, we didn't keep it moderate.  That caused some runners a lot of wear and tear.  Even the professional runners today don't race as much as Frank Shorter and I raced back in the seventies and early eighties.  The fastest older runners today are people who came into the sport later in their lives, not Frank Shorter or me.  We have too many miles on our bodies, though I think maybe I should do Boston this year because the desire for it never goes away.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Today, runners run fewer miles and do more cross training.<br /> </strong><br /> There's definitely more knowledge and awareness of cross training, and I think that's good for us older runners, too.  We're the first generation of older people who are trying to stay fit, though we aren't necessarily marathoning or doing Ironmans.  <br /> <br /> Most people aren't active.  They don't even walk!  They have jobs that are too much for them and take up too many hours, so they can't find the time to run.  They think,  This'll just make me more tired,  or they were never chosen for a sports team, so they don't believe they can be an athlete. <br /> To me, you're an athlete if you try, but you need a boost.  Take a look at our sports teams: eight, ten, twelve people per side.  Just a few people!  That leaves everyone else!  You have to figure out what you want to do, and explore it.  Now people are finding out what they love, and for more and more people, it's long-distance running.  <br /> <br /> <strong>What happens to people when they commit to running a marathon?<br /> </strong><br /> You change when you become a runner.  Think of those 25-year-olds -- they've got a journey ahead.  They're seeing all of the older runners out there, and that's got to be mindboggling to them.  I think it is such a cool thing that kids can see their parents run, and vice versa.  It wasn't like that thirty years ago.  You didn't often see parents running with their kids. <br /> <br /> If I had a part in people finding this quest for themselves, that's great.  At a marathon, we all cheer for each other, which is pretty cool. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 15:56:27 -0500"	"sports"

"Kobe Bryant Has Every Right To Be Upset With Laker Teammates"	"When Kobe Bryant talks, we listen. That's what five NBA titles and a league MVP get you. As a result, it became national news when the 36-year-old Bryant was caught on camera going after his teammates for a lackluster effort during practice.  Soft,  he called them.<br /> <br /> <img alt= kobe  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386394/thumbs/r-KOBE-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> The current Los Angeles Lakers roster is part has-been and part never-was, along with some players who belong in the D-League. It is a sad reminder of the state of an organization associated with championships and excellence. And it didn't help that Bryant's remarks came on the heels of the franchise's most famous and beloved player ever, Magic Johnson, going on record wishing that the team would lose the rest of its games.<br /> <br />  I hope the Lakers lose every game,  <a href= http://espn.go.com/losangeles/nba/story/_/id/12005550/magic-johnson-says-hopes-los-angeles-lakers-lose-every-game  target= _hplink >Johnson said</a>.  Because if you're going to lose, lose. And I'm serious. <br /> <br /> Bryant was right. As I <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jordan-schultz/kobe-bryant_b_6035458.html?utm_hp_ref=the-schultz-report  target= _hplink >tried to convey before the season began</a>, his prolific scoring prowess is going nowhere. And yet the lack of effort by a talented yet enigmatic scorer like Nick Young is appalling. So when Young started blabbering about being the best one-on-one player in the world, it's no surprise that Bryant lit him up.<br /> <br /> Here's a thought for Nick Young: Who cares? What difference does it make? Your team is 6-16 and the laughingstock of not just the Western Conference but the whole NBA. Young, even with his dynamic scoring ability, is at best a sideshow clown without a winning nature who consistently makes losing plays.   <br /> <br />  I think Nick probably regrets getting me started at practice and saying something,  <a href= http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/12016979/los-angeles-lakers-star-kobe-bryant-critical-teammates-heated-scrimmage  target= _hplink >Bryant said</a>.<br /> <br /> <img alt= nick young  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2386416/thumbs/r-NICK-YOUNG-large570.jpg  /><br /> <br /> Bryant, because he can't help himself, will find a way to give a Herculean effort, even in losses. He is a mere 30 points behind the incomparable Michael Jordan to become the third-leading scorer in league history. He has been in the NBA over half his life and genuinely doesn't know how to go less than 100 percent. The problem is that the Nick Youngs and Jordan Hills of the world don't understand such a concept. <br /> <br /> Whether or not GM Mitch Kupchak fields a capable roster in Bryant's final years -- the Lakers will have cap room for max contracts -- remains to be seen. What we do know, however, is that No. 24 will not stand for mediocrity, even when his teammates will.<br /> <br /> Head coach Byron Scott summed it up:  Any time (No.) 24 practices,  he said,  it's going to be an intense practice. I think he brings out the best in the guys. It's a good way to start the trip. ... I don't think anything irritated him. I just think he did a great job of getting everyone else fired up. He's always fired up. That's the great thing about him. <br /> <br /> The fact that he's the only one fired up is the not-so-great thing about the rest of this team.<br /> <br /> <em>Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at <a href= https://twitter.com/Schultz_Report >@Schultz_Report</a>, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.

"Dark Matter Signal May Have Been Found In Mysterious X-Ray Data"	"After a decades-long search, astronomers may finally have found the <a href= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-12/epfd-rdp121114.php  target= _hplink >first sign of dark matter</a>. That's the <a href= http://home.web.cern.ch/about/physics/dark-matter  target= _hplink >invisible substance that scientists believe makes up the bulk of our universe</a>, since visible matter accounts for only about 20 percent of our universe's mass. <br /> <br /> While scientists can observe dark matter indirectly by looking at its gravitational effects on visible matter, they have struggled to come up with tangible evidence that proves the stuff exists--until now. <br /> <br /> This week, a team of researchers from Switzerland and the Netherlands announced that they may have detected the signal of decaying dark matter particles. <br /> <br /> For the research, the team analyzed the x-rays emitted from two celestial objects: the <a href= http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2014/perseus/  target= _hplink >Perseus galaxy cluster</a>, an array of galaxies located approximately 250 million light years from Earth, and our <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy  target= _hplink > sister  galaxy Andromeda</a>, which is approximately 2.5 million light years away. The researchers looked at data collected by the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope and spotted a mysterious  anomaly  that could not have been emitted by any known atom or particle.<br /> <br /> The <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/x-rays-dark-matter_n_5528961.html  target= _hplink >same strange x-ray spike was also detected</a> by a research team at Harvard in June, who announced they had spotted the emission in data from 70 different galaxy clusters.<br /> <br />  This tiny (several hundred extra photons) excess has been interpreted as originating from very rare decays of dark matter particles,  Dr. Alexey Boyarsky, a professor of physics at Leiden University in the Netherlands and the lead researcher for the new study, told The Huffington Post in an email.  Although the signal is very weak, it has passed several 'sanity checks' that one expects from a decaying dark matter signal. <br /> <br /> For instance, the researchers say the signal was more concentrated in the center and weak at the edges of Andromeda and the Perseus cluster, which corresponds to what they expected. Boyarsky added that the team has now found a signal at the same wave length coming from our own galaxy, the Milky Way.<br /> <br /> Boyarsky and his team believe the signal comes from the decay of a dark matter particle, possibly a  sterile neutrino,  which is a hypothetical particle believed to be <a href= http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2014/02/x-rays-other-galaxies-could-emanate-particles-dark-matter  target= _hplink >1/100th the size of an electron</a>. <br /> <br />  Confirmation of this discovery may lead to construction of new telescopes specially designed for studying the signals from dark matter particles,  Boyarsky said in a written statement.  We will know where to look in order to <a href= http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-12/epfd-rdp121114.php  target= _hplink >trace dark structures in space</a> and will be able to reconstruct how the Universe has formed. <br /> <br /> The research is scheduled to be published next week in the journal Physical Review Letters.

"Research Links Addictive Social Media Behavior With Substance Abuse"	"Plenty of research has demonstrated that the <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-judson-brewer/social-media-addiction_b_4079697.html  target= _hplink >addictive quality of social media</a> is very real. And according to a new study, heavy social media use may also contribute to a different type of addiction. <br /> <br /> Psychologists at the University of Albany found that not only is social media (particularly Facebook) itself potentially addictive, those who use it may also be at greater risk for impulse-control issues like substance abuse. <br /> <br /> The researchers surveyed 253 undergraduate students, asking questions about their social media use, Internet addiction, emotion regulation and alcohol use. They found that roughly 10 percent of users experience  disordered social media use,  meaning that they exhibit addictive behaviors in the way they use platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. To assess disordered social media use, the researchers included questions that reflected modified diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, such as,  How good does Facebook make you feel?  and  Do you check Facebook first thing when you wake up in the morning?  <br /> <br /> Those who were struggling with social media addiction were more likely to report Internet addiction (as measured by scores on the <a href= http://netaddiction.com/internet-addiction-test/  target= _hplink >Young Internet Addiction Test</a>), challenges with emotion regulation (such as poor impulse control), and drinking problems. <br /> <br /> Psychologist Julia Hormes, who led the study, said that Facebook was found to have especially addictive properties. The respondents spent an average of one-third of their online browsing time on Facebook, and 67 percent received Facebook push notifications on their phones.  <br /> <br />  New notifications or the latest content on your newsfeed acts as a reward. Not being able to predict when new content is posted encourages us to check back frequently,  <a href= http://www.albany.edu/news/56604.php  target= _hplink >Hormes said in a statement</a>.  This uncertainty about when a new reward is available is known as a 'variable interval schedule of reinforcement' and is highly effective in establishing habitual behaviors that are resistant to extinction. Facebook is also making it easy for users to continuously be connected to its platform, for example by offering push notifications to mobile devices. <br /> <br /> The researchers hypothesize that disordered social media use is likely a symptom of poor emotion regulation skills, which heightens susceptibility to a variety of types of addiction. <br /> <br /> “Our findings suggest that disordered online social networking may arise as part of a cluster of risk factors that increase susceptibility to both substance and non-substance addictions,” <a href= http://www.albany.edu/news/56604.php  target= _hplink >Hormes said</a>. <br /> <br /> The new findings join a growing body of research investigating the addictive potential of Internet social media use. MRI data has shown that the brains of compulsive Internet users to <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/30/shocking-ways-internet-rewires-brain_n_4136942.html  target= _hplink >exhibit similar changes </a>to those seen in people with alcohol and drug addictions. Harvard <a href= http://www.pnas.org/content/109/21/8038.abstract  target= _hplink >research conducted in 2012</a> provided some insight into why using Facebook in particular seems to be so highly addictive. Disclosing information about ourselves, the researchers found, is intrinsically rewarding. It activates the Nucleas Accumbens, a brain area that also lights up when cocaine or other drugs are ingested. But it's not just posting on Facebook that's addictive -- it's also receiving all those likes and comments. Another study found that receiving <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-judson-brewer/social-media-addiction_b_4079697.html  target= _hplink >positive feedback about ourselves</a> also activates the brain's reward centers. <br /> <br /> However, Hormes' and other research can't be taken as conclusive evidence that disordered social media use constitutes a full-blown addiction. <br /> <br />  The question of whether or not disordered online social networking use can be considered a 'true' addiction is a tough one,  Hormes said in an email to the Huffington Post.  I think the answer really depends on your definition of 'addiction.' Many people think of addictions as involving ingested substances. However, if we think about addiction more broadly as involving some kind of reward then it is easier to see how behaviors may be addictive. <br /> <br /> The new findings were published in the December issue of the journal <em>Addiction</em>.

"Bill Nye: Creationism Is 'Raising A Generation Of Young People Who Can't Think'"	"The biggest danger creationism plays, according to Bill Nye the  Science Guy,  is that it is raising a generation of children who  can't think   and who  will not be able to participate in the future in same way  as those who are taught evolution.<br /> <br /> Speaking on <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq3CvTP_LHc  target= _hplink >MidPoint</a>, Nye said he blames an older generation of evangelicals  who have very strong conservative views  and who are  reluctant to let kids learn about evolution.  Their <a href= http://www.businessinsider.com/texas-school-board-debate-on-evolution-2013-11  target= _hplink >presence on school boards</a> leads to debates over curriculum, Nye argued, which further inhibits schools' ability to teach facts.<br /> <br />  Religion is one thing. People get tremendous comfort and community with their religions,  Nye said.  But whatever you believe, whatever deity or higher power you might believe in, the Earth is not 6,000 years old.  <br /> <br /> Nye, who has a new book out titled  Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation,  recently participated in a <a href= http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/02/04/271648691/watch-the-creationism-vs-evolution-debate-bill-nye-and-ken-ham  target= _hplink >debate</a> with creationist Ken Ham, which some argued was a moment of embarrassment for the science community.<br /> <br /> University of Chicago evolution professor Jerry A.

"Students Give Professors Better Evaluations If They Think They're Male: Study"	"Students tend to give better evaluations to their professors if they think they're male instead of female, according to <a href= http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4  target= _hplink >a study</a> published last week in the journal Innovative Higher Education.<br /> <br /> The study, led by Lillian MacNell, a doctoral student at North Carolina State University, used an online summer course on introductory anthropology and sociology to, essentially, <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfish_%28film%29  target= _hplink >catfish</a> students. The class was divided into four discussion groups, with two assistant instructors, one male and one female, teaching two discussions groups each. The assistant instructors collaborated to write and teach in similar ways. <br /> <br /> However, the male instructor only told one of his groups that he was male, and told his other group he was female. Likewise, the female instructor only told one group she was female, and told her other group she was male.<br /> <br /> At the end of the course, students were asked to fill out an evaluation about their instructor. Overall, the instructors did not receive significantly different evaluations. But the female instructor received better evaluations when students thought she was male. The male instructor, meanwhile, received worse evaluations when students thought he was female.<br /> <br /> <script id= infogram_0_mean-of-student-ratings---male  src= //e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?64g  type= text/javascript ></script><div style= width:100%;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center; ><a target= _blank  href= https://infogr.am/mean-of-student-ratings---male  style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none; >Mean of Student Ratings - Male Instructor</a> |<a style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;  href= https://infogr.am  target= _blank >Create infographics</a></div><br /> <br /> <script id= infogram_0_mean-of-student-ratings---female-instructor  src= //e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?i1m  type= text/javascript ></script><div style= width:100%;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center; ><a target= _blank  href= https://infogr.am/mean-of-student-ratings---female-instructor  style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none; >Mean of Student Ratings - Female Instructor</a> |<a style= color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;  href= https://infogr.am  target= _blank >Create infographics</a></div><br /> <br /> <br /> The evaluations also included specific questions about how the instructor performed, and the responses to these questions reveal an even deeper bias. Both instructors returned grades to their students after two days. But when students were asked to rate their instructors on promptness, instructors perceived as male received an average rating of 4.35 out of 5, while instructors perceived as females received an average rating of only 3.55.<br /> <br /> Male-perceived instructors also scored higher on questions about interpersonal measures, even though, according to the study,  both actual instructors demonstrated the same level of interpersonal interaction in their attempts to create a sense of immediacy in the online classroom.  The researchers theorized that female instructors are generally expected to have high interpersonal skills -- meaning that a female instructor would have to work harder than a male instructor just to get the same rating.<br /> <br /> The study argues that if these biases are coming across so clearly in teacher evaluations,  this particular form of inequality needs to be taken into consideration as women apply for academic jobs and come up for promotion and review.

"Men Do The Dumbest Things, According To Science"	"The next time you call the man in your life an “idiot,” know that science — if not compassion — is on your side. <br /> <br /> A new tongue-in-cheek analysis published in the typically offbeat Christmas edition of the distinguished <a href= http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7094  target= _hplink >British Medical Journal</a> examined <a href= http://www.darwinawards.com/rules/  target= _hplink >winners of the Darwin Awards</a> -- a dubious prize given to those among us who have injured ourselves or even perished due to, uh, poor risk assessment skills. They found that 88.7 percent of the  winners  were male.<br /> <br /> On the other hand, the clever person who came up with this study is himself a man -- or close: 15-year-old <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/local/wp/2014/12/12/british-medical-journal-men-really-can-be-idiots/  target= _hplink >Ben Alexander Daniel Lendrem from Newcastle, U.K.</a>, conceived and carried out the analysis with his statistician father, Dennis Lendrem, reports The Washington Post. <br /> <br /> The Lendrems defined idiotic risks as “senseless... where the apparent payoff is negligible or non-existent, and the outcome is often extremely negative and often final. <br /> <br />  According to 'male idiot theory' (MIT) many of the differences in risk seeking behavior, emergency department admissions, and mortality may be explained by the observation that men are idiots and idiots do stupid things,” explained the study authors.  In this paper we present evidence in support of this hypothesis using data on idiotic behaviors demonstrated by winners of the Darwin Award. <br /> <br /> The team ran an analysis of 20 years of Darwin award winners and whittled down the cases to those whose deaths were independently verified were included. Awards shared by men and women (usually “overly adventurous couples,” notes the study) were also left out.<br /> <br /> That left 318 Darwin awards: 282 given to men, and 36 to women. Researchers note that the difference between the sexes is highly statically significant, which means it’s extremely unlikely that this division occurred by chance. Here’s how the study authors distinguish a Darwin-worthy death from a more routine accidental death:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>For instance, Darwin Awards are unlikely to be awarded to individuals who shoot themselves in the head while demonstrating that a gun is unloaded. This occurs too often and is classed as an accident. In contrast, candidates shooting themselves in the head to demonstrate that a gun is loaded may be eligible for a Darwin Award -- such as the man who shot himself in the head with a “spy pen” weapon to show his friend that it was real.</blockquote><br /> <br /> Other examples of Darwin winners include the terrorist who didn’t put enough postage on his package when sending a mail bomb; it was returned to him, and he promptly opened it and perished. Another man attached a shopping cart to the end of a train car, which dragged him to his death. <br /> <br /> Though half in (rather morbid) jest, serious, comprehensive research has also found that men are more apt to take risks and less apt to control their impulses than are women, to damaging effect. This study notes that men are more likely than women to be admitted to hospital emergency rooms after accidental injuries and more likely to be in a traffic collision with a higher mortality rate. <br /> <br /> Of course, even wacky studies have their limitations: Men drink alcohol more than women, which could skew the results. Alternately, idiotic men may idiotically die in a more newsworthy way, which leads them to be nominated for the Darwin awards. Finally, more woman may be nominating men for the award.

Should it be a light and fluffy yeast doughnut or a thicker cake doughnut? Should it have cinnamon sugar, glaze or <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/08/powdered-sugar_n_6289842.html  target= _hplink >powdered sugar</a>? Jelly filled, cream filled or filled with nothing but air, because there's an appropriately sized hole in the middle? Let's not even get started on the cruller. As luck would have it, a mathematician in England has just supposedly identified the <a href= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11284809/Mathematician-creates-formula-for-the-perfect-doughnut.html  target= _hplink >mathematically perfect doughnut</a>. <br /> <br /> The Telegraph reports that Dr. Eugenia Cheng, Senior Lecturer of Pure Mathematics at the University of Sheffield, came up with a  squidgy to crispy ratio  to measure doughnuts and find the ideal one. If you're wondering what  squidgy  means, you're not alone.  <a href= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/squidge  target= _hplink >Squidge</a>  means to squash or crush, so the doughnut's  squidginess  or  squidge factor  refers to how much it squashes in your mouth. (It's also a completely endearing Britishism that makes us wish the English could describe all of our food.)<br /> <br /> <a href= http://metro.co.uk/2014/12/10/maths-reveals-the-secret-to-the-perfect-ring-doughnut-its-to-do-with-the-size-of-the-hole-apparently-4981661/  target= _hplink >Metro UK explains</a> Cheng's formula:  We take the overall volume of the doughnut and then subtract the volume of the squidgy part on the inside, which is itself in the shape of a doughnut, with the same R (radius of doughnut) but smaller r (radius of dough.).  Stay with us. Basically Cheng believes the size of the doughnut hole is critical for affecting the way the doughnut tastes. The smaller the hole, the more squidgy the doughnut, because there's more surface area to squidge and less dead space. A bigger hole makes for a crispier doughnut, because there's less fluffy dough to squash, and less dough will crisp faster. We think that's the idea, anyway.<br /> <br /> The kicker of this whole equation is that it's commissioned by none other than Domino's Pizza. <a href= https://www.dominos.co.uk/  target= _hplink >Domino's UK</a> <a href= http://consumerist.com/2014/12/01/you-can-now-get-hot-doughnuts-from-dominos-in-the-u-k/  target= _hplink >started selling a new line of doughnuts</a> last month, and apparently it hired a scientist to find the ultimate doughnut. Cheng says that the squidgy-to-crispy ratio in Domino's doughnuts is 78:22, because its doughnuts have smaller-than-average holes. Whether or not this particular ratio is  perfect,  and whether or not more squidge equals tastier doughnuts, is, of course, up for debate. <br /> <br /> Judging by appearance alone, the size of the hole in many of America's favorite doughnuts (seen below) -- from the classic to the gourmet -- may not indicate anything at all. Like all great food debates, it would appear that the perfect doughnut is still a completely subjective matter. We're willing to try 'em all though, in the name of science. If anyone gets their hands on Domino's doughnuts in the UK, please tell us how it ranks on a scale of 1 to perfection. <br /> <br /> <HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--389166--HH><br /> <br /> <br><br /> <b><em>Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

"This New Phone App Can Tell When You've Had Too Much To Drink"	"<p>A new federally funded cellphone app allows people who may have had one too many to get an idea just how drunk they are — and hail a ride home.</p><br />               <p>Users enter their sex, height, weight, and number of drinks consumed to help figure out their blood-alcohol level. They also can play two interactive games to test reaction time and cognitive agility. And the app uses GPS technology to call cabs and pre-load phone numbers for potential designated drivers.</p><br />               <p>The app, called ENDUI — pronounced  End DUI  — was announced Thursday by government and police officials in Maryland. Funded by federal money reserved for drunken-driving education efforts, the app is among several in a handful of states to tackle drunken driving — though Maryland's is one of the most elaborate.</p><br />               <p> It's unique,  said Kara Macek, a spokeswoman at the Governors Highway Safety Association, of the new app, which was developed by the Maryland Highway Safety Office for about $50,000. The app was funded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p><br />               <p> I think states are starting to go that route because they're trying to reach consumers where they are and where they spend time, and everyone spends time on their phone,  Macek said.  I think we're going to see more of that as we go forward. </p><br />               <p>States with similar apps include New York, New Mexico, Colorado, and California, which launched its version two weeks ago.</p><br />               <p>Like the other states, Maryland's app is available for free on Android and iPhone.</p><br />               <p>One of the games on the app involves pressing a red  brake  button when an image of a pedestrian passes by or a car ahead stops. The app says just how fast — or slow — users react and how much time their car would have needed to avoid a collision.</p><br />               <p>The other game shows nine road signs that blink in different order; users try to recall the order, which gets increasingly challenging with each round — with or without drinks.</p><br />               <p> The game is meant to be a hook and pull you in,  said Tom Gianni, chief of the Maryland Highway Safety Office.  Then it's meant to give you a lesson of, 'See what can happen. Imagine if you were behind the wheel.' </p><br />               <p>A feature that estimates blood-alcohol levels has users enter their height and weight, and details about what kind and how many drinks they have. For instance, the app estimates that a 130-pound woman who just drank a glass of red wine would have a blood-alcohol level of .04 percent.</p><br />               <p>Though that's under Maryland's legal limit of .08 percent, the app warns that  driving ability is likely to be impaired. </p><br />               <p> Get a cab or have someone that has not been drinking take you home,  the app advises.</p><br />               <p>At nearly every step, the app warns users that no matter what the results,  driving with any amount of alcohol in your system may impair you and be illegal. </p><br />               <p>Gianni called the driving-related features the most important for someone who's been drinking.</p><br />               <p> It kind of takes the guesswork out of a situation where you've had a few drinks and you're not sure what to,  Gianni said.  This takes all the brainwork out of it. </p><br />               <p>____</p><br />               <p>Previous versions of this story incorrectly stated who funded the app. The app was funded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, not the Governors Highway Safety Association.</p> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 14:47:01 -0500"	"science"
"Street Drug 'Special K' May Offer New Hope For People With Treatment-Resistant Depression"	"A hallucinogenic drug known on the street as  Special K  offers new hope to those suffering from severe, treatment-resistant depression. <br /> <br /> Ketamine, which was originally developed in the 1960s as a milder version of PCP, already has a well-established medical use as a sedative or pain killer. But since 2000, <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25426012  target= _hplink >small but high-quality studies</a> have demonstrated its uses as a powerful and fast-acting treatment for major depression. <br /> <br /> The growing body of evidence has emboldened doctors to begin prescribing Ketamine for depression, despite the fact that the drug has not been approved for such a use and the long-term effects are still unknown. To address those unknowns, various pharmaceutical companies are <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/business/special-k-a-hallucinogen-raises-hopes-and-concerns-as-a-treatment-for-depression.html  target= _hplink >formulating their own versions</a> of the drug and testing them in clinical trials, as The New York Times recently reported, but advocates say that the trials are simply an attempt to make money on tweaked versions of a generic drug. <br /> <br /> Ketamine doesn't work like common, widely-used antidepressant medications like Prozac, Zoloft or Lexapro, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that change the <a href= http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825  target= _hplink >balance of the neurotransmitter serotonin</a>. Instead, Ketamine targets receptors of glutamate, an amino acid.<br /> <br /> Scientists first noticed that targeting glutamate had an antidepressant effect more than 50 years ago, when doctors administered a glutamate-modulating antibiotic to tuberculosis patients and saw their moods lift, according to Dr. Robert Howland, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. <br /> <br /> Howland recently published a review of 25 peer-reviewed studies (that had a total of 416 participants) in the journal <a href= http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825  target= _hplink >Neuropharmacology</a> that examined the effects of Ketamine treatment on people with treatment-resistant depression.<br /> <br /> All 25 studies suggested that Ketamine was indeed an  active and rapid antidepressant  for people with treatment-resistant depression (approximately 10 to 20 percent of those who have depression), wrote Howland in his review. Three of those studies even showed that Ketamine appeared to reduce suicidality (suicide ideation) in people treated with the drug. This confirms that glutamate plays an active role in this mental illness, according to Howland. <br /> <br /> But serious questions remain about the drug's long-term effects, as well as its ability to sustain the same levels of antidepressant over time without upping the dose. After all, people can become addicted to  Special K,  and large doses of the drug could cause hallucinations, aggressive or violent behavior and even death from overdose, according to the University of Maryland's <a href= http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/ketamine.asp  target= _hplink >Center for Substance Abuse Research</a>. <br /> <br />  Although limited to initial observations, ketamine may be effective not only in TRD patients but also on suicidality,  concluded Howland in his study review.  However, future studies are recommended in order to test the efficacy of ketamine when compared with other active comparators such as electroconvulsive therapy or antidepressant-antipsychotic drugs combinations.

"Immediately After A Stroke, Your Next Steps Are Crucial"	"<br>By Shereen Lehman</br>                <br>(Reuters Health) - Time is critical when someone has a  stroke, but care can be delayed when victims, bystanders or even  health workers don't recognize the emergency, a new study in the  UK finds.</br>                <br>Better public awareness of the signs of stroke and the  importance of seeking immediate emergency care are needed, the  authors say.</br>                <br/>                <br>Stroke signs include the sudden onset of various symptoms  such as confusion, difficulty speaking, droopy face or slurred  speech, weakness in a limb, numbness, being off-balance, visual  loss or a really severe headache.</br>                <br> Getting to hospital quickly is particularly important for  patients who suffer certain types of stroke, because they can  benefit from clot busting drugs, but only if these are given  within hospital within 4.5 hours of symptoms starting,  Ruth  Mellor, who led the study, told Reuters Health by email.</br>                <br> We knew from earlier research that people who have a stroke  can take a long time to get to hospital and wanted to understand  why that was,  said Mellor, who is a researcher with the  National Health Service Lanarkshire.</br>                <br>Her team interviewed 30 stroke patients to learn about their  decisions and experiences, with an emphasis on the routes that  eventually got them to the hospital for stroke treatment.</br>                <br>All the patients lived in cities. Most were white men, under  age 65. Most strokes occurred at home.</br>                <br>Eighteen patients contacted a health service before going to  the emergency department, but the remaining 12 took more  circuitous routes to the hospital.</br>                <br>Less than half arrived at the emergency department within  three hours of their first symptoms, but no times were recorded  for 11 of the patients, the researchers reported in Annals of  Emergency Medicine.</br>                <br>Delays in getting treatment happened when patients didn't  recognize the severity of their symptoms or decided to contact  their primary care doctor instead of emergency services.</br>                <br>Bystanders were often important. Eleven patients reportedly  sought help from friends or family to make sure something was  definitely wrong, while 12 patients resisted the idea that they  were having a stroke and were forced by bystanders to get help.</br>                <br>In eight cases, bystanders actually delayed the process,  possibly because they didn't want to take responsibility for the  decisions, the study team writes.</br>                <br>The researchers also found delays in care when health care  workers didn't recognize the severity of symptoms. Two patients  were misdiagnosed at the hospital and sent home.</br>                <br> People experiencing stroke symptoms may not always be the  best judge of the seriousness of the symptoms, bystanders have a  big role to play in recognition of stroke and helping people to  get to appropriate care,  Mellor said.</br>                <br>Calling the emergency medical services number (911 in the  U.S.)  so that an ambulance can take them to hospital quickly  can make a real difference,  Mellor said.</br>                <br> People need to think 'FAST': Face drooping, Arm weakness,  and Speech difficulty, then Time to call 911,  Mellor said.</br>                <br>Dr. Justin Sattina, a neurologist at the University of  Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison who  was not involved in the UK research, said the importance of  bystanders stood out for him.</br>                <br> It's a story I've heard plenty of times, that the patient  resisted seeking help but the spouse insisted or they call the  daughter who happens to be a nurse or whatever, and that's why  they're here,  Sattin said.</br>                <br>He told Reuters Health he always reinforces that behavior.   The husband will be angry that the wife called 911 and it  caused a big scene with the ambulance out in front at their  house, and I say 'no, no, no, your wife did the right thing,'   Sattin said.  I see these little looks of thanks when I  reinforce that for the family. </br>                <br>Sattin said calling 911 is better than calling a relative or  a doctor because then the hospital gets alerted to be ready.</br>                <br/>                <br> The thing about coming in by 911 is that there's  pre-notification to the hospital that there's a stroke patient  coming in and everything clicks along faster,  Sattin said.</br>                <br>There's no time wasted in the waiting room, he said, and  some hospitals bypass the emergency room entirely and take  patients straight to the CT scanner.</br>                <br> You don't get the benefit of that if you (drive to the  hospital), even if it's true that you arrive at the front door a  little quicker, it disrupts what's really an intricate and  adjusted process of caring for acute stroke patients,  Sattin  said.</br>                <br>SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1umrHzI Annals of Emergency Medicine,  online November 15, 2014.</br> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 13:07:00 -0500"	"science"

"California Battles Worst Whooping Cough Epidemic In Seven Decades"	"SAN DIEGO (AP) — California officials are battling the worst whooping cough epidemic to hit the state in seven decades as a recent rebound in cases raises questions about the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine.<br /> <br /> Doctors emphasize that the inoculation has led to fewer deaths than in the past and in instances where people do get sick, their illnesses aren't as severe. But California officials say the limited protection of the vaccine introduced in the 1990s has led to the rise in cases. Research has shown it doesn't last as long as the one it replaced, and a new study suggests the vaccine may not prevent the spread of the disease. Whooping cough peaks every three to five years, and California's last epidemic was in 2010. But despite an aggressive public health campaign in response, the current outbreak is worse.<br /> <br /> A total of 9,935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health from Jan. 1 to Nov. 26 — the highest number in 70 years.  The cases included one infant who died. Elementary, middle and high school outbreaks have occurred across the state.<br /> <br /> The bacterial infection causes uncontrollable, violent coughing, which often makes it hard to breathe. People often take deep breaths which result in a  whooping  sound.<br /> <br /> San Diego County is among the hardest hit areas with 1,819 cases reported so far this year.<br /> <br />  We'd have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases,  said Dr. Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County.<br /> <br /> That's when whooping cough was common, causing hundreds of thousands of illnesses annually and thousands of deaths. But after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, cases dropped to fewer than 5,000 a year.<br /> <br /> That vaccine was replaced in the 1990s because of side effects, which included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. The newer vaccine is part of routine childhood vaccinations as well as adult booster shots.<br /> <br /> Last year was the nation's worst year for whooping cough in six decades— U.S. health officials received reports of more than 48,000 cases, including 18 deaths. This year the number of reported cases nationwide dropped to about 20,000.<br /> <br /> After the 2010 epidemic, California launched a campaign about the importance of rapid diagnosis and treatment, especially in young infants. The state also started providing free vaccines for children, pregnant and postpartum women.<br /> <br /> Dr. Gil Chavez, epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, said while more people, especially pregnant women, need to get vaccinated, he does not believe low inoculation rates are the primary cause of the current epidemic: Of this year's pediatric cases that had information on the child's vaccination history, only 10 percent of those infected in 2014 had not been vaccinated against pertussis.<br /> <br /> Chavez says the new vaccine's limitations and better tests have led to the increase in cases.<br /> <br /> Cases are likely to continue going up as doctors do a better job at detecting the illness, officials say.<br /> <br /> More than two years ago, Kathryn Riffenburg, who lives outside Boston, said doctors told her that her newborn son, Brady, likely had a cold. A week and a half later, she took him to the emergency room as he struggled to breathe.<br /> <br /> By the time, he was diagnosed with pertussis it was too late to save the 2-month-old boy.<br /> <br />  It made us angry, because we felt more should have been done,  said Riffenburg, who know advocates for pregnant women and anyone else in contact with infants to get vaccinated."

"Tiny Invisible Robot Gives Whole New Meaning To The Term 'Baby Steps'"	"One day in the not-too-distant future, doctors may be able to treat deadly diseases like cancer by injecting an army of tiny nanorobots into the bloodstream. We're not there yet, but researchers say they may be <a href= http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/science-blog/walkers-baby-steps-towards-molecular-robots  target= _hplink >one step closer to turning this science fiction-like idea into science fact</a>.<br /> <br /> Chemists at the University of Oxford have built a nano-sized molecule that can  walk  its way across a tiny track. The team developed a new method to observe the teensy robot take its one nanometer-long stride, since microscopes can only spot the motion of objects as small as 10 nanometers. <br /> <br />  These are the smallest steps that have been observed in real time, i.e. as they happen,  Dr. Hagan Bayley, a professor of chemical biology at the University of Oxford and one of the researchers, told The Huffington Post in an email.  The step size is about one 100,000th of the diameter of a human hair. <br /> <br /> The new  walkers  aren't the only tiny robots out there. Previous researchers have built <a href= http://news.discovery.com/tech/dna-nanobot-spider.htm  target= _hplink >molecular robots made of DNA</a>, but these were much bigger than the new small molecular walkers and only work in water, according to the Oxford Science Blog.<br /> <br /> For the new research, Bayley and his colleagues built their  walker  from an arsenic-containing molecule and placed it on a  track  made of a single strand of protein built inside a tiny protein pore. As the walker moved across the track's footholds, this caused changes in the current flowing through the pore. The researchers mapped these changes, allowing them to chart the walker's steps (see video below).<br /> <br />  At the moment we don’t have much control over which direction the walker moves in; it moves pretty randomly, Dr. Gokce Su Pulcu, a postdoctoral fellow who studies nanotechnology at the university and the lead author of the new research, told Oxford Science Blog. The protein track is a bit like a mountain slope; there's a direction that's easier to walk in so walkers will tend to go this way. We hope to be able to harness this preference to build tracks that direct a walker where we want it to go. <br /> <br /> The researchers hope that one day these nanobots may be able to deliver drugs throughout the body, or combine together into larger nanomachines that can operate inside cells.<br /> <br /> The new research was <a href= http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nnano.2014.264.html#affil-auth  target= _hplink >published online on Dec. 8</a> in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.<br /> <br /> <iframe width= 570  height= 428  src= //www.youtube.com/embed/WDF_Iij3yQ4?controls=0&showinfo=0  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 09:44:00 -0500"	"science"
"This Is How Much Of Beyoncé's Breath You Inhale Every Time You Breathe"	"Here is a classic problem given to students in statistics classes:  How many molecules of Caesar's last breath do you inhale every time you breathe? <br /> <br /> To answer the query, no scientific testing is required. Instead, students are asked to use mathematics in an effort to work their way to a guesstimation. This type of question is called a  Fermi problem,  where answers are found to seemingly impossible questions based on setting out clear approximations and assumptions. With this sort of analysis, you can get answers to questions even as crazy-seeming as,  How many molecules of Beyoncé's breath do you inhale every time you breathe? <br /> <br /> Before going any further, let's note that Beyoncé's breathing is particularly notable. In the 2004 Destiny's Child single  Lose My Breath,  Beyoncé -- along with Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams -- sings,  Can you keep up? / Baby boy, make me lose my breath / Bring the noise, make me lose my breath / Hit me hard, make me lose my...  Then they all breathe heavily. Aren't you at least a little bit curious how much of these Queen B exhales end up making it into your own plebeian lungs?<br /> <br /> To answer that Beyoncé-related Fermi Problem, The Huffington Post reached out to <a href= https://www.odu.edu/directory/people/l/lweinste  target= _hplink >Professor Lawrence Weinstein</a> of the Old Dominion University <a href= http://www.odu.edu/physics  target= _hplink >Department of Physics</a> and co-author of <em><a href= http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8625.html  target= _hplink >Guesstimation: Solving the World's Problems on the Back of a Cocktail Napkin</a></em>. Professor Weinstein was game to take on this pop culture Fermi problem quite thoroughly, this despite its ridiculous nature and Professor Weinstein certainly having more important things to do than humor us about Beyoncé.<br /> <br /> <em>All text below has been written by Professor Lawrence Weinstein and formatted/illustrated by The Huffington Post.</em><br /> <br /> <br /> <img alt= TK TK gifs  width= 570  src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/yoncebreatheeee.gif  /> <br /> <br /> <font size= 4 ><strong>How much of the air you just breathed was once breathed out by Beyoncé?</strong></font><br /> <br /> Let’s start with an easier question: How much air did Beyoncé just exhale? When you exhale you can certainly fill a 1-liter soda bottle, but not a lot more than that. However, that 1-liter of breath contains 3´10^22 air molecules (this comes from high school chemistry where one mole of gas contains 6´10^23 molecules and occupies 22 L of volume at standard temperature and pressure).<br /> <br /> <img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F1.png  data-mobile-src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F1_Mobile.png /><img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F2.png  data-mobile-src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F2_Mobile.png /><br /> <br /> <br /> <br><font size= 4 ><strong>How big is the entire atmosphere?</strong></font><br /> <br /> To answer that we need to know (or Google) a few numbers. The volume of the atmosphere equals the surface area of the Earth (4´10^14m^2 or 400 million-million square meters) times the height of the atmosphere. Airplanes fly at 30,000 feet (or 10,000 meters) so there is some air up there.  However, there is not enough for us to breathe. Let’s use 10,000 m since it’s a nice round number. This gives a volume for the atmosphere of (4´10^14m^2)´(10^4m)=4´10^18m^3.  Since there are 1000 L in 1 m^3, this means that the atmosphere contains about 4´10^21 (or about 4 billion-trillion) breaths. This is why scientists use scientific notation (10 raised to some power) because otherwise keeping track of all the -illions gets confusing.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br><font size= 4 ><strong>How far does Beyoncé’s breath travel?</strong></font><br /> <br /> If you blow really hard, your breath might travel a few feet. Beyond that, we depend on wind and the motion of gas molecules (diffusion) to mix her breath throughout the atmosphere. At wind speeds of 10 mph, some of the molecules in one breath could travel around the Earth in a few months. We’ll assume that it takes a full year to spread a breath evenly around the globe so that the air around each us contains some of those molecules.<br /> <br /> <img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F3.png  data-mobile-src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F3_Mobile.png /><br /> <br /> <br /> <br><font size= 4 ><strong>How much of Beyoncé’s 3:47:29 PM January 2013 breath did you just inhale?</strong></font><br /> <br /> Beyoncé exhaled this more than a year ago, so it should be thoroughly mixed throughout the entire atmosphere. Since the atmosphere contains 4´10^21 breaths, you will only inhale 1/(4´10^21)»2´10^-22 of that breath. However, since that 3:47:29 PM January 2013 breath contained 3´10^22, you just inhaled <strong><em>six molecules</em></strong> of that special exhalation.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br><font size= 4 ><strong>So for every breath you take, you inhale six molecules from every breath Beyoncé exhaled. Doesn’t that make you feel special?</strong></font><br /> <br /> <img src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F4.png  data-mobile-src= http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_PopCultueFermi_F4_Mobile.png /><br /> <br /> Pedantic physics note: all nitrogen molecules (or oxygen molecules or carbon-dioxide molecules …) are perfectly interchangeable. It is completely impossible, even theoretically, to trace a particular molecule back to a particular person’s particular breath. On the other hand, through the quirkiness of quantum mechanics, this means that ALL of the molecules you just inhaled have an equal (although terribly small) chance of having been exhaled by Beyoncé.<br /> <br /> <em>Graphics by Jan Diehm and gif illustration by Eva Hill for The Huffington Post.</em> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 09:29:50 -0500"	"science"
"What This Gay Atheist Learned From Being an Evangelical Christian"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-choir.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-13-choir.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-13-choir-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 380  /></a><br /> <br /> I was raised as a devout Evangelical Christian. My readers know I discarded that identity as an adult and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-sosa/jesus-is-just-a-myth-tell_b_5749472.html  target= _hplink >don't mince words</a> whenever the subject of religion arises. But what many probably don't realize is that religion continues to impact my life in profound ways. Sociologists say that even American atheists are often  cultural Christians,  as the roots of our identities come from the experiences of both our pasts and current surroundings. And most U.S. citizens were raised in and around Christianity.<br /> <br /> Evangelical Christianity, which, like all religious systems, has a host of well-documented problems. But I won't be discussing those here, as it's something I do often. This is about the way communities shape our identities, and how good can be drawn even from the experiences of identities we later reject.<br /> <br /> These five concepts exist in many other forms around the world, but I discovered them through being a Christian. After a few years outside the isolation of an Evangelical community, these are values I find most lacking in the mainstream and would pass on to others who are still building their own identities.<br /> <br /> <strong>Intimacy is not just for romantic partners.</strong> Those who have spent a lot of time around Evangelicals will notice that they tend to have uniquely personal relationships with each other. Platonic male friendships are the most noticeable, as they veer outside the emotional boundaries of masculinity in mainstream culture. They're often physically affectionate, talk openly about subjects that make most people feel vulnerable and routinely say  I love you. <br /> <br /> <strong>Caring for the needs of others leads to a happier life.</strong> When someone was without food, clothing, shelter or other necessities, the church would step in to help. And by  the church,  I mean the people within it would often individually offer their assistance. Caring for others wasn't just a duty, it was viewed as a privilege. Through that service, people formed bonds that remained throughout their lifetimes and, as a bonus, ensured that goodwill existed for themselves if they fell onto hard times.<br /> <br /> <strong>Using polite language averts hostility.</strong> This easy lifestyle choice is a valuable one for both professional and private interaction. Cursing and overt disrespect almost never lead to a better result, because displays of anger show a lack of self-control and stability while putting the other person on the defense. People have trust for individuals whose behavior isn't abusive, even when having a disagreement.<br /> <br /> <strong>Music is an essential component of community.</strong> Evangelicals sing <em>all the time</em>. And despite what  Footloose  would have you believe, Christian usually love to dance. Music forms a huge part of religious identity. The worship songs of Christianity are often based on communal joy and celebration. Uplifting music is a reliable tool for easing social tension and bringing diverse groups of people together in a dynamic way.<br /> <br /> <strong>Loving others is our primary responsibility.</strong> Evangelical Christians believe that love is greater than even faith, which is written by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians. While one can turn on the news and see Christian leaders ignoring this value, it doesn't change the fact that the concept imprinted itself on my life. As a lifestyle vegan, civil rights advocate and progressive political commentator, love remains the guiding force in the derivation of my values.<br /> <br /> Will I be returning to Evangelical Christianity? Nope. But that doesn't mean I can't use the best parts of my past to inform the choices I make as I step into the future. "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 16:31:08 -0500"	"religion"
"In the Face of Systemic Racism, South Asians Must Not Keep Silent"	"These past few weeks have been gut-wrenching for African Americans and other communities of conscience. The execution of black men and forgotten black women by white police officers, and the failure of justice first reemerging in Ferguson and now in New York City, have poured salt into the festering wound of systemic racism that has marred America's history.<br /> <br /> They have also been painful for me to watch as an Indian-American immigrant who was brought to this country as a child. This is now my adopted country. Although I was not born here, I found my voice here, found the music of my childhood here, and fell in love here. America is now home in ways that India can never be.<br /> <br /> And yet, I cannot be at home in this nation. How can I, in a land where my white brethren routinely kill my black brothers and sisters? Watching this bloodletting compels me to ask what are the obligations of those who are neither black nor white in this fratricidal country? Should we stay out of the fray, mindful of the marginality that comes to many of us because of our status as immigrants?<br /> <br /> As a Christian, I am guided by the prophet Jeremiah's words to Judah's exiles in Babylon:  Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon ... Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. <br /> <br /> If God calls an exilic people to work for the well being of their captors, then I too am bound to work for the welfare of this land. But how can this country be well so long as this centuries old racial divide violates the American body politic? Those of us of other hues must make labor with African Americans in order to free America from its captivity to white supremacy.<br /> <br /> This country has been largely kind to South Asians in ways that it has never been to its black citizens. African Americans have been enslaved, tortured, lynched and now criminalized, victimized by the New Jim Crow prison-industrial complex, and shot dead by police at 21 times the rate that whites are.<br /> <br /> After 9/11, Muslim communities came under suspicion and have been subjected to aggressive policing. After 9/11, Sikhs have been violated by hate crimes and even by mass murder as in the case of the Oak Creek Gurdwara shooting. The reach of white supremacy is long, and South Asians too have felt its sting.<br /> <br /> But there can be no question of symmetry; any suggestion of equivalence between the sufferings of South Asians and African Americans would be invidious. After all, agents of the state routinely execute African Americans whereas Sikh Americans have been killed by isolated white supremacists.<br /> <br /> Over recent years, I have watched as some have held up the success of the Indian American community to say that the United States is a land of opportunity in which anyone, regardless of race, can make it. The point of this discourse is explicit: see, South Asians have made it here so blacks have only themselves to blame for their own predicament.<br /> <br /> When South Asians like Dinesh D'Sousa speak in this fashion, they accept the status of  honorary white  and its attendant privileges; this status is offered on the condition that we keep silent about race and accept our compliant role as a  model minority.  Some of the most successful members of the Indian community have accepted this devil's bargain -Governors Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley, for example - and have been handsomely rewarded. The best that Governor Jindal can spout after Ferguson is the stale and deadly rhetoric of color-blindness and victim blaming:<br /> <br />  A young man is dead - this situation is truly a tragedy and our hearts go out to his family ... Some have used this as an excuse for lawlessness, arson and destroying property, but that is not the answer ... I do not care what pigmentation anyone's skin is. Justice is color blind, God is color blind, and I believe we all should be color blind. <br /> <br /> To talk about God's color-blindness and his in a country that kills according to color is an exercise in complicity.<br /> <br /> South Asians of conscience have a special obligation to speak out when we see uniformed officers snuff out black lives without consequence. Our histories are interlinked because African-Americans and Indians have fought together to forge a global nonviolent struggle to liberate those that W.E.B. Du Bois called the  darker races of the earth. <br /> <br /> The pain of the African-American community should bring South Asians of conscience to grief, frustration and rage, not least because we know we are in this country because our black brothers and sisters marched, fought and died to make this country a more just and inclusive nation. The Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, and the Immigration and Nationality Act passed in 1965. The latter Act struck down race-based immigration quotas that prevented Asians from entering the United States. Without the work of Rosa Parks, Bayard Rustin, James Lawson, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Martin Luther King, Jr., without Montgomery and Selma, our communities of color would not be here. The struggles that made 1964 possible also made 1965 possible.<br /> <br /> The Civil Rights Movement was itself the fruit of the shared spiritual yearnings of African-Americans and Indians. Therefore, South Asian immigrants are under historical, moral and spiritual obligations to refuse offers of white privilege and join in solidarity with African-Americans. We must remember the long conversation between W.E.B. Du Bois, Benjamin Mays, Howard and Sue Bailey Thurman, Mordecai Johnson and B.R. Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi that sought to bind together our peoples in a common struggle for justice in India and the United States.<br /> <br /> Next semester, Cornel West and I will co-teach a course on Gandhi and King at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. The course will explore the transmission of ideas and energies and the long enduring bond between the United States and India, between African Americans and Indians. That connection includes what Gandhi learned from American abolitionists and Quakers through Tolstoy, who learned about the promise of nonviolence in part by a close study of the American scene.<br /> <br /> When an African American delegation led by Howard Thurman and his wife Sue Baily Thurman visited Gandhi, Gandhi famously and prophetically said to Dr. Thurman,  It may be through the Negroes that the unadulterated message of nonviolence will be delivered to the world.  We seek by our work to advance Gandhi's hope.<br /> <br /> We are also committed to this course because we want to learn again with our courageous, justice-seeking students about the transformative power of radical and disruptive nonviolent resistance, a power that young black leaders are demonstrating again in the streets of Ferguson. We believe strongly that South Asian Americans and African-Americans must bind ourselves together to bring the promise of nonviolent resistance to bear on the work of healing the American soul of the cancer of racism.<br /> <br /> <em><a href= http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2014/12/10/4146064.htm  target= _hplink >This piece was originally published here</a>. </em> "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 15:11:50 -0500"	"religion"

Although the autonomous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq was already a refuge for an estimated 250,000 Syrian refugees, since the Islamic State began its onslaught on Iraq in June, Kurdistan has also taken in a more than one and a half million displaced people. Many have been placed in purpose-built refugee camps but the huge numbers mean thousands of others are forced to live in un-finished buildings or inadequate, makeshift shelters and as winter in the region closes in, there are growing concerns for the welfare of the refugees who, while their homes are still in ISIL controlled territory, have no realistic prospect of returning to them. <br /> <br /> <strong>Mexico City, Mexico: December 12<br /> </strong><img alt= religion  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388486/thumbs/o-RELIGION-900.jpg?1  /><br /> Pilgrims prepare to perform a traditional dance outside the Basilica of Guadalupe on Our Lady of Guadalupe's feast day in Mexico City, Mexico. <br /> <br /> <strong>Karbala, Iraq: December 13<br /> </strong><img alt= religion  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2388474/thumbs/o-RELIGION-900.jpg?1  /><br /> Iraqi Shiite Muslim pilgrims attend the Arbaeen religious festival which marks the 40th day after Ashura, commemorating the seventh century killing of Prophet Mohammed's grandson, Imam Hussein, at the Imam Hussein shrine in Karbala, 50 miles (80 kilometres) south of Baghdad.

"Celebrating Christmas"	"It was about 2,044 years ago, in 30 B.C., that there was a great celebration throughout all of the Roman Empire, especially among Roman leaders.  The Roman army became the supreme ruler of the land, and the ships of the Roman people became the rulers of the sea.  There was no question that Rome was the ruler of the world as it was known at that time.<br /> <br /> There appeared to be much glory and splendor throughout all of Rome, but much of it was like surface skin that covers deep and fatal sores not visible on the surface -- in this case, the hidden resentment of the common people. They were poor. And more than being poor, the common people were terribly mistreated. Cruelty seemed to be the policy of the government toward them.  As far as the common people were concerned, there was no hope for the future, and they had become depressed, despondent, easy to mistreat and subjected to becoming slaves.<br /> <br /> But one night all of this changed when, in Bethlehem, a young girl, unknown to the world, gave birth to a baby boy. This event was to change all history. For this baby boy grew to be a great man -- a man called by the name of Jesus. His birthday marks more than the date of his birth, it marks the birth of a new era -- the inauguration of a new culture -- the beginning of a new creed -- the fountainhead of man's hope. <br /> <br /> Although the birth took place in what was then a relatively unimportant walled town (about 1,000 people) built on a limestone ridge of the Judaean highland that overlooks the Dead Sea, such a significant event could not go unnoticed. The world noticed it then, and for the majority of time since then the world has noticed it.  And certainly we notice it now.  In fact, the celebration of the birthday of Jesus is the most widely celebrated holiday throughout the world today.  But it hasn't always been that way.<br />  <br /> In the early days of the Christian Church it was illegal to be a Christian.  Many early Christians did not celebrate Christmas for fear of being severely persecuted, and those who did celebrate Christmas did so secretly so as not to call attention to themselves.  There are nativity scenes carved in rocks of the ancient catacombs of Rome where the Christians frequently hid during the days of persecution.<br /> <br /> After Constantine became the undisputed emperor of the Roman Empire, sometime between A.D. 320 and 325 he declared that Christians would no longer be persecuted.  In fact, instead of it being illegal to be a Christian, he declared that all people should be Christians.  So Christians began celebrating Christmas once again.  It had been almost 300 years since they celebrated the birth of Christ.  They reverted to their Hebrew heritage and centered the Christmas celebration on a feast, a typical way for Hebrew people to celebrate great occasions.<br /> <br /> This is not to suggest that such feasts were times when people gathered around large tables to eat festive foods.  Feasts, or more correctly festivals, were times of dancing, singing, eating, and entertainment, sometimes lasting several days.  The early Christians named the Christmas celebration  The Feast of the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> It was sometime around A.D. 1038 that the word  Christmas  began to evolve.  The established church at that time realized that the most significant aspect of the celebration of the birth of Jesus was the  Mass --the celebration of the Sacrament of Holy Eucharist in conjunction with a worship service focused on the birth of the Savior.  So the church changed the name of the celebration of the birth of Jesus from  The Feast of the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ  to  Christ Mass,  more popularly called  Christ's Mass  or the  Mass of Christ.    It is understandable how Christ Mass evolved into  Christmas.   Since about A.D. 1050,  Christmas  has been the word used throughout the world to refer to the time Jesus was born.<br /> <br /> The Bible does not tell us the exact birth date of Jesus.  We only know that it was during  the first enrollment when Quirinius was governor of Syria.  (Luke 2:3, RSV)  There has been much scholarly research as to exactly when this would have been.  The general consensus is that Jesus was born sometime between 7 and 4 B.C., probably closer to 4 B.C.  But there is no indication of what days or month such a census would have conducted.<br /> <br /> The probable day and month of the birth of Jesus finally narrowed down to January 6 or December 25.  The problem primarily was that there were several very popular pagan feasts celebrated about those same times of year.  Some Christian leaders wanted to have the celebration of Christ's birthday on the same day as one of the popular pagan feasts in order to keep Christians from joining the pagan festivities, while others wanted to make sure that there was no connection between the pagan feasts and the celebration of Christmas.<br /> <br /> Finally, about 350 years after the birth of Jesus, Bishop Liberius of Rome declared the date of Christmas as December 25, and since then that is the date that has been accepted by nearly all the peoples of the world.  <br /> <br /> Actually, we will never know the exact birth date of Jesus.  But that really doesn't make any difference, for we know that Jesus was a real person who is still alive and is a very real presence in our lives today.  Let us focus on that as we prepare for a blessed Christmas celebration.<br /> <br /> Next week we will take a look at Mary and Joseph. "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 09:20:44 -0500"	"religion"
"Massive Nativity Scene Reportedly Breaks World Record"	"A full 1,039 people, as well as a camel and several sheep, took part in a <a href= http://www.good4utah.com/story/d/story/utah-youtubers-help-break-record-for-worlds-larges/35155/4M8C-4lzA0ulOVkOZtxz-Q  target= _hplink >massive nativity scene</a> filmed in Provo, Utah on Dec. 1 that reportedly broke the <a href= http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-living-figures-in-a-nativity-scene/  target= _hplink >Guinness World Record</a>.<br /> <br /> The idea for the project came from Christian media group <a href= http://www.radiant.org/press  target= _hplink >The Radiant Foundation</a>, a sub-brand of the Deseret Management Corporation, which hoped to offer a holiday message that would  show the importance of Christ during Christmas,  according to Radiant's digital strategist John Dye.<br /> <br /> Radiant approached several Christian YouTube stars, including The Piano Guys, American Idol winter David Archuleta and Peter Hollens who agreed to take part in the scene and who were joined by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in a sweeping <a href= http://youtu.be/PrLoWt2tfqg  target= _hplink >rendition</a> of  Angels We Have Heard on High  for the scene. In addition to breaking the Guinness record for most people in a nativity scene, Dye said he also believed the event to have been one of the largest collaborations of YouTubers ever. <br /> <br />  Our goal is to give people the inspiration to share this with others and help them understand the importance of Christ,  Dye told HuffPost over the phone.<br /> <br /> The video was produced on  a shoestring budget,  Dye said, and was dependent on the help of volunteers, many of them students at the nearby Brigham Young University. Dye worried the weather on the December filming date might deter volunteers, but said it ended up being unseasonably warm. This, as well as other near-mishaps, convinced him that  divine intervention  was at play in the production.<br /> <br />  We really feel that this was something that needed to be done,  Dye told HuffPost.  We felt inspired to do it and we saw inspiration all along the way in the hand of the Almighty in this process.  "	"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 09:05:08 -0500"	"religion"
"Bill Nye: Creationism Is 'Raising A Generation Of Young People Who Can't Think'"	"The biggest danger creationism plays, according to Bill Nye the  Science Guy,  is that it is raising a generation of children who  can't think   and who  will not be able to participate in the future in same way  as those who are taught evolution.<br /> <br /> Speaking on <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq3CvTP_LHc  target= _hplink >MidPoint</a>, Nye said he blames an older generation of evangelicals  who have very strong conservative views  and who are  reluctant to let kids learn about evolution.  Their <a href= http://www.businessinsider.com/texas-school-board-debate-on-evolution-2013-11  target= _hplink >presence on school boards</a> leads to debates over curriculum, Nye argued, which further inhibits schools' ability to teach facts.<br /> <br />  Religion is one thing. People get tremendous comfort and community with their religions,  Nye said.  But whatever you believe, whatever deity or higher power you might believe in, the Earth is not 6,000 years old.  <br /> <br /> Nye, who has a new book out titled  Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation,  recently participated in a <a href= http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/02/04/271648691/watch-the-creationism-vs-evolution-debate-bill-nye-and-ken-ham  target= _hplink >debate</a> with creationist Ken Ham, which some argued was a moment of embarrassment for the science community.<br /> <br /> University of Chicago evolution professor Jerry A.

"Saudi Artist Photographs Daily Life From Behind A Veil And Learns Unexpected Lesson"	"While the mandate that women should cover their hair is an tenet of Islamic belief, the act of wearing a veil that completely shields a woman's face is a matter of tradition, not religion. For Saudi photographer <a href= http://www.faisalalmalki.com/  target= _hplink >Faisal Almalki</a>, this female ritual remained one shrouded in mystery. He resolved to experience the practice for himself, documenting the entire experience with his camera.<br /> <br /> <img alt= untitiled  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381070/thumbs/o-UNTITILED-900.jpg  /><br /> <br />  It started as both a visual and investigative experiment,  Almalki told the Huffington Post Arts.  From a visual point of view, I -- as a photographer and person -- cherish sight and I've always wondered how veils affect sight and seeing. But on a more contextual level, I've always wanted to understand this sub-culture and I thought if I managed to at least see the world they way they see it, I might scratch the surface of 'walking a mile in their shoe.' <br /> <br /> For his photographic investigation, Almalki took inspiration from 20th century German biologist Jakob von Uexkull, particularly his idea of the '<em>umwelt</em>' or 'self-world as perceived by organisms living within it.' The artist stepped into the role of biologist to fully immerse himself in this alien way of life.  Understanding how organisms experience their surroundings, needs and motivations can only be achieved by stepping into their perceptual world,  the exhibition expressed.  An organism creates and reshapes its own <em>umwelt</em> when it interacts with its environment.  <br /> <br /> <img alt= breath  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381072/thumbs/o-BREATH-900.jpg  /><br />  <br /> Almaki titled his series  Lone Canyon,  referencing the gap between a woman and her veil. Yet as the photographic process continued, the artist noticed it changing shape.  I took a few photos of flowers as seen from behind the veil, except some of those flowers weren’t real –- but the veil affects vision enough for us (ie. Her) not to see the difference. And that’s when I realized that I wasn’t trying to understand veiled women, I was trying to judge them.  While the project began as an effort to see through an Islamic woman's eyes (and veil), it ended up revealing the biased mode of viewing the artist himself possessed.<br /> <br />  Those pictures instead became a portrait of my prejudice,  he explained.  I’ve always resented how some western media outlets profiled Muslims and Middle Eastern, and this showed me how I was doing the same. Turning the veil onto that barrier between us and 'the others,' whoever that might be. <br /> <br /> <img alt= post  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2381076/thumbs/o-POST-900.jpg  /><br /> <br /> As Almaki's series progressed, the symbols associated with the veil changed shape.  When I started working on this project, I kept saying that I wasn't pro or against veils, I just wanted to offer their perspective to the world.  Yet Almaki realized that for many, the veil isn't just a symbol of difference but of inferiority, of otherness.  Suddenly, the veil, became a symbol of prejudice, that wall between any person and 'the others.'  Almaki's project then transformed into an investigation of the invisible veil that so many unknowingly wear, the obstructive layer of prejudice.<br /> <br />  Lone Canyon  runs at Athr Gallery in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia until January 10, 2015.

"Torture and the Killing of Jesus"	"In the 1950s and early 1960s, trend-setting comedian Lenny Bruce often said,  If Jesus had been killed twenty years ago, Catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses. <br /> <br /> Bruce was right that any device used to kill Jesus Christ in any age would have become a symbol of both divine judgment and divine deliverance to the faithful. What Bruce did not get right was his assumption that the cross of the first century was equal to the electric chair of the twentieth century, that both were meant only to execute. The truth is that the cross was a Roman tool of torture before it was a tool of death. It was meant to inflict such horrible suffering on a single man that an entire nation was made to cower.<br /> <br /> This is a truth that ought to condition attitudes toward torture today, particularly among those who regard Jesus as God. It means that there is a direct connection between the events of that first Good Friday and the torture depicted in the recent film Zero Dark Thirty, that there is a line to be drawn between Guantanamo Bay and Golgotha, between the evils of Bashar al-Assad, president of Syria, and the evils of Pontius Pilate, governor of Judea. <br /> <br /> In the Roman mind, crucifixion was an act of state terror. By the time of Jesus, the ancient world had already tried dealing with its undesirables by boiling them in oil, stoning them, strangling them, drowning them and setting them on fire. All of these brought on death too quickly. Officials wanted a method of killing that was slow and terrifying enough that no onlooker missed the implied threat. Crucifixion met this need.<br /> <br /> The name reveals the purpose: cruciare-torture. In practice, it was simply death by impalement. In meaning, it was a statement of what rulers could do to anyone who resisted their will. <br /> <br /> The Romans learned the art of crucifixion from the Greeks, improved upon it, and made it a tool of Empire. In answer to the slave revolt under Spartacus in 71 B.C., the Empire crucified six thousand rebels, famously lining the road from Rome to Capua with crosses. During the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., the Romans crucified as many as 500 rebels a day. <br /> <br /> Crucifixion was the perfect blend of death, vengeance, spectacle and terror. Victims took days to expire, sometimes as much as a week. Soldiers taunted and further tortured the dying, often driving stakes through body parts associated with the victim's crimes. Genitalia received special attention. Wildlife sometimes ate away at bodies before the mercy of death arrived. <br /> <br /> Nearly alone against such horrors in the ancient world was the teaching of the Jews. Their law taught that men were made in the image of God and thus the human body was holy. This truth was the basis for prohibitions against murder, against cutting oneself in grief, even against tattoos. So great a matter was punishment by death that even after lawful executions, the dead were removed by sundown so that the land itself would not be desecrated. <br /> <br /> The Romans had no such scruples and it is why sometime around 30 A.D. Jesus of Nazareth spent six hours gasping wide-eyed for breath while soldiers gambled for his clothes and crowds of onlookers urged him to get on with the business of dying. He was killed in a place so public that many who watched him die came upon him accidentally. This was all as Rome intended: a cruel death meant not merely to kill a man but to kill the spirit of a nation, to end not just a single Jew but the threat that any Jew might pose to the Empire.<br /> <br /> We should see the ancient Roman zeal for crucifixion as one with its later zeal for the cruelties of the gladiators' games and, ultimately, as one with the hardening and barbarity of an entire people. Torture as martial technique led to torture as entertainment and eventually to torture as commonplace and nearly unremarkable. Nobility died in this progression, as did compassion, and, finally, the Empire itself.<br /> <br /> It could very well be the same in our own time. While there is certainly a place for aggressive interrogation -- even deception and the intimidation of captives -- in the conduct of a just war, dehumanizing torture produces a dehumanized people, bitterness that endures for generations, and an undermining of the noble principles that may have at first given legitimacy to the conduct of war. <br /> <br /> Those who worship Jesus -- the most famously tortured man in history -- ought to be the greatest opponents of the kind of tortures he endured. If their faith grows from the soil of the Jewish law and if they remember what their ancestors endured at the hand of Rome and a hundred other persecutors, they will stand against the similar violation of the image of God in man today.<br /> <br /> Torture is not merely an issue of political left or right. It is not just an issue of military opinion versus civilian. It is an issue that grows from the nature of man, from the principled vision of a nation and from the highest of religious truth. There is no better time to assert this than during the Christmas season, a time in which we celebrate the life of Jesus. There is also no better time to assert this than the present moment in our nation's history, a time in which we hope to learn from the excesses of our recent wars and to live out, in Lincoln's hopeful phrase,  the better angels of our nature.

"Rebirth of a Nation"	"In the third chapter of the ancient Gospel narrative titled John, a religious leader named Nicodemus approached Jesus under the cover of night. Jesus stated,  I tell you the truth, unless you are born again, you cannot see the Kingdom of God.  Nicodemus then inquired of The Christ,  What do you mean? How can an old man go back into his mother's womb and be born again?  <br /> <br />    As with Nicodemus, the idea of rebirth has been a point of contention, controversy and curiosity, a point vigorously debated among the early church councils, a point of departure among diverse adherents to the faith. Just what does it mean to be  born again ? Of many perceptions of meaning, one prominent belief is that to be  born again  is to be released from the fatal consequences of sin, which first originated with Adam and Eve and became a heritage for the entire human family, and to have the hope of an Utopian existence with God in a future time. <br /> <br />    If America has a sin of origins, a sin deeply rooted within the nation's epistemology, it is undoubtedly racism. Permeating the soil and soul of our country even before the nation's founding, and fully grafted into our nation's DNA through its founding documents, racism is a sin long befalling America. <br /> <br />    If the wages of sin is indeed death, America's bloodied history reveals that we have been fully compensated.  <br /> <br />    In 1915, American racism may have reached its zenith with the cinematic release of <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>. Widely regarded as a cinematic masterpiece and historically footnoted as the first motion picture screened at The White House, <em>The Birth of a Nation's</em> racist depictions of African Americans -- especially African American men as inherently ignorant, violent and hyper-sexualized savages -- aided the Ku Klux Klan, who used the film as a recruitment tool, in dramatically increasing its membership rolls. The movie reflected and exasperated fears of an American society under Black rule, fears emergent during the Reconstruction Era after Blacks were freed from slavery, en masse. <br /> <br />    Our nation's xenophobic proclivities have caused great harm to many and have led to generations of marginalization and oppression. <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> vividly offered a portrait of White America's worse nightmare: a society run a muck by freed Blacks. The film would reached its horrifying height as a white woman fled through the woods to escape a large Black male seeking to rape her. <br /> <br />    Ironically, although common, the Black male rapist was depicted by a white male actor. When finally cornered by her would-be assailant, the white woman leapt from a cliff to her death. As she fell, she incited the murderous intentions of thousands, and hundreds of real Black men became their victims.  Since its release nearly one hundred years ago, we have lived in an era defined by the film's cultural constructions, the greatest legacy of which is the terrifying Black man -- ignorant, deviant, bent on destruction. This construction is so ingrained within our nation's consciousness that, for many, the Black man is the personification of evil.<br /> <br />    Even as The White House is presently occupied by a biracial, African American self-identifying man and his Black family, constructions of African Americans as ignorant, violent and sexual deviants remain prevalent throughout culture and media. These constructions are not without consequence, and it has often proven fatal. In fact, it is this cruel criminalization of color that has resulted in the death of countless unarmed Blacks at the hands of police officers for generations. <br /> <br />    As innocent blood flows in our nation's streets, parks, stoops and stairwells, it calls forth for justice. As constricted airways whisper forth screams of agony, it calls forth for a new day. As the body count attributed to these painful atrocities continues to rise, our nation has reached a boiling point and the calls for justice amid gross injustices has resulted in an uprising. It is in the midst of these uprisings, the likes of which we have not seen upon these shores in two generations, that America is being reborn.<br /> <br />    Surely some are as Nicodemus, unsure, even doubtful of the possibilities of this rebirth. Jesus answered Nicodemus' concern thusly:  The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can't tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can't explain how people are [born again].  <br /> <br />    It may be hard to explain rebirth, but it is easy to hear. <br /> <br />    I recently had the opportunity to address a  This Stops Today Rally  in downtown Dallas. As I panned the diverse crowd, the cries of  Black lives matter,   Hands up, don't shoot,   No justice, no peace,   I can't breathe,  and  This stops today  filled the night time air. Under the cover of night, the mystery of rebirth once again unfolded.<br /> <br />    I told the story of Allen Brooks, a 50-year-old Black man who had been accused of assaulting a white child. I acknowledged that any Black man accused of anything in 1910 was deemed guilty by mere accusation. As he appeared in court, a mob broke into the courtroom, placed a noose around his neck and threw him out the second floor window. He landed head first upon the ground below. <br /> <br />    Some have stated the fall may have killed him, but he was still stripped of his clothes, then dragged by the rope around his neck to the corner of Elm and Akard Streets where he was lynched. His body would later have to be rushed out of the city as, after being cut down, the rabid crowd still desired to burn Brooks' body. When the judge called a grand jury to identify Brooks' killers, although a multiplicity of police officers were present, and although there were horrific pictures of the day's tragedy, the police officers said that they could not identity one offender. <br /> <br />    For Allen Brooks, there was no justice.<br /> <br />    As we gathered that night, only 0.3 miles from where Brooks was lynched, it was impressed upon me that the same sin that killed Allen Brooks in 1910, and the same sin that informed <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> in 1915, continues to claim new victims today. So as we rallied and marched, it was not just for Michael Brown, Eric Garner, John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Ezell Ford, but for all whose names history no longer remembers but who suffered similar fates.<br /> <br />    As we continue to lie down, march, chant and organize for justice together, we serve as the midwives to our nation's rebirth. Our collective cries echoing forth in these winds of change signify that our nation's water has finally broken in order that justice might  flow like rivers, and righteousness like a mighty stream.  America is contracting, and ours will not be a still birth. No, these present labor pains will bring forth justice and equality to all! <br /> <br />    On account of America's many sins, we are now being redeemed <em>by</em> the people and <em>for</em> the people. Our fight is still young, and it is not without opposition. Indeed, there appear to be days of struggle ahead. Although the road ahead remains challenged, the imperative before us is clear: <br /> <br />    Push! <br /> <br />    Our labor shall not be in vain. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 17:18:22 -0500"	"religion"
"Social Worker Empowers Muslim Women In Need With Sewing Class"	"When Tahani Jabarin started the Introduction to Sewing and Dressmaking program at the <a href= http://www.daralhijrah.net/ns/  target= _hplink >Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center</a> in northern Virginia, she was hoping to create  a road to self-sufficiency  for Muslim women in her area. Made possible by a $10,000 grant from <a href= http://www.irusa.org/  target= _hplink >Islamic Relief</a>, a U.S.-based charity organization, the sewing class graduated its first class of 12 students on Nov. 5.<br /> <br /> Jabarin, 37, told The Huffington Post she could not be happier with the results.  Thank God things went great,  she said.<br /> <br /> A social worker at Dar Al-Hijrah with no background in sewing, Jabarin said she chose the subject because it's something women with children can do from home. Jabarin runs the program, but she hired a woman with commercial sewing experience to teach the actual classes. Women ages 18 and above who earn half the area median income or less, or who receive financial assistance like food stamps, were eligible to sign up for the first round of lessons, as long as they agreed to attend every one, Jabarin said.<br /> <br /> Participants were also asked to pay a $300 fee for the class, but were issued waivers if they were unable to afford the cost. In exchange, the women received six hours of instruction every week for 16 weeks, with an additional four-hour workshop on starting their own business. Projects included clothing and home decor like curtains and lampshades. Dar Al-Hijrah sells the students' work on-site, Jabarin said, and each student gets 50 percent of whatever proceeds her pieces bring in, meaning the women can receive an income even during the program.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sewing class  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371058/thumbs/o-SEWING-CLASS-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps most significantly, those who completed 100 hours of sewing received their own machine, which Jabarin described as crucial for ensuring the women would continue their work after graduating. Of the 12 women who graduated in November, Jabarin said that more than half started making an income within two weeks of completing the course. A new 16-week course, she said, began earlier this month.<br /> <br /> <img alt= sewing class  src= http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2371048/thumbs/o-SEWING-CLASS-570.jpg?6  /><br /> <br /> <br /> Jabarin spoke with one of the graduates on behalf of HuffPost Religion to illustrate the program's effect on participants. Due to a language barrier, Jabarin spoke to the woman in Arabic and translated her answers into English.<br /> <br /> <strong>How did you find the sewing group?</strong><br /> <br /> My name is Fawzia, and I was born in Sudan. I am 42 years old, and I have eight children, ages 25, 23, 17, 9, 8, 5, 2 years old and 4 months old. As an immigrant mother with eight children, I was facing financial instability that lost me my apartment and led me to seek a home in a shelter. Fortunately, the shelter I was placed in happened to be within walking distance of Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center. Through [a social worker's] help, I joined the sewing class, which enabled me to become self-sufficient via training whilst establishing an income. I applied for a waiver, since I had no income through which to pay for this class, and I received it, rendering my sewing lessons charge-free.<br /> <br /> <strong>What have been some of the biggest struggles in your life since coming to the U.S.?</strong><br /> <br /> My most immediate issue was the language barrier. I required some time to learn the English language and become accustomed to speaking it. Secondly, as a mother, I faced the enormous problem of finding an apartment to rent for me to live in with my children. Having been blessed with a large family, it was difficult finding a place big enough to accommodate us. Not being able to be a self-sufficient mother who could provide for her children shook me to the core.<br /> <br /> <strong>In what ways, if any, does the holiday season affect these concerns?</strong><br /> <br /> The holiday season is more taxing, as this is a family-oriented time during which I wish to present my children with the most joyous experience possible whilst also working hard to provide for them. I received support from my children’s elementary school, which donated gift cards to me in order to be able to purchase the Thanksgiving turkey. Simultaneously, I receive continuous support from Dar Al-Hijrah, which has a thrift store on-site. At any point that I need assistance buying clothing, I apply for aid and receive a $100 gift card to use at the store in order to keep my children and myself warm during this colder time of year. <br /> <br /> <strong>In what ways has joining the sewing class made a difference in your life?</strong><br /> <br /> During this difficult year of my life, these obstacles enclosed me in a severe depression that I even received therapy for. Nothing seemed to really help me deal with the crippling mentality that I was unproductive until I joined the sewing group. Walking down from the shelter to the Islamic Center every Monday and Wednesday became something to look forward to, and my mood was automatically elevated on those days.<br /> <br /> Additionally, the shelter kept telling me that I had an “exit date” and that I had to find a place to live. It just so happened that my graduation date coincided with my exit date from the shelter. It was my graduation, and the program director’s recommendation, that allowed the shelter to extend my stay for one more week. My life had finally begun looking up. I was becoming self-sufficient, which had always been my dream, and I was finally able to provide for my children.<br /> <br /> I learned that much like sewing, life occurs in several stages, not all at once. Having acquired patience, I was able to push myself through these difficult times and persevere until I was able to improve my life. Having received my certificate of completion and my sewing machine, I finally felt like a productive member of society.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are your hopes for improving your family’s circumstances moving forward, and how will the skills you’ve learned through the sewing group help you?</strong><br /> <br /> The day I graduated, I received my sewing machine from Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center. Furthermore, Dar Al-HIjrah connected me with the county’s case workers, who held several workshops that taught us to transform our sewing skills into a commercial method in order for us to establish our own businesses and become self-employed.<br /> <br /> I walked into this class thinking I would only be taught to sew clothing, but soon thereafter I learned that was not the case. Aside from sewing clothing, I learned how to create home décor items like handkerchiefs and even custom-made draperies.

" Troubled  Moses or Traumatic Origins of the Bible?"	"The star of the new Ridley Scott movie about Moses,  Exodus: Gods and Kings  (release Dec. 12), described Moses earlier this Fall (as reported in <a href= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christian-bale-playing-moses-he-737012  target= _hplink >the Hollywood Reporter</a>) as  a very troubled and tumultuous man  who was  likely a schizophrenic and was one of the most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life.  Though these comments by Christian Bale show insensitivity to contemporary communities for whom the figure of Moses is deeply important, he has picked up on an important feature of the stories surrounding Moses: they are saturated in ancient experiences of trauma. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have no way to ascertain whether Moses personally suffered from trauma. He lived long before history was written down in Israel and the stories about him are shrouded in centuries of later tradition. That said, we do know that the biblical books about Moses (Exodus --Deuteronomy) were completed in the wake of ancient Israel's deepest crisis, hundreds of years after Moses: when the holy and supposedly invulnerable city of Jerusalem had been destroyed, its kingship ended, and its populace sent into seeming permanent exile in Babylon. <br /> <br /> This crisis, this experience of exile, was so intense that it qualifies as an ancient example of  trauma.  Indeed the exile was so traumatic for the ancient Israelites that they rarely wrote about it directly. The histories of the Bible go up to the destruction of Jerusalem and exile, have a gap, and then pick up again fifty years later when some exiles were allowed to start returning to Israel. If an individual had such a gap in their personal story, one might suspect that they had suffered trauma that they could not remember or speak about. For ancient Israel, the loss of city, kingship and especially possession of the land was a communal  near death  experience that was virtually impossible for them to describe explicitly. <br /> <br /> When survivors of trauma find it difficult to talk directly about their trauma, they often find indirect ways to reflect and process their unspeakable experience. The exiles in Babylon did this by retelling the Moses story in ways that reflected their experience of loss, vulnerability, and communal near-annihilation. They set Moses's birth amidst crisis. The Egyptian Pharaoh develops a genocidal scheme to have midwives murder all newborn Israelite boy babies. <br /> <br /> When the midwives subversively undermine Pharaoh's order, he orders all Israelite babies be thrown in the Nile (Exodus 1:15-22). This is the situation when Moses is born to a couple in the Levitical tribe. Frightened at what might happen to her son, Moses' mother places her baby in a waterproofed basket and sets him adrift on the Nile River. In other words, the book of Exodus opens with slavery, infant genocide, and an individual mother's decision to let her baby son loose on a river, a form of possible infant exposure -- all related in the first chapter and a half! <br /> <br /> As the story continues, the character of Moses develops in ways that mirror his people's vulnerability. For example, after he has been set loose, as a three-month old baby on the mighty Nile, he is rescued by an Egyptian princess and grows up in an Egyptian household. The child Moses of this story thus lives like an exile amid foreigners, even as his mother is hired as his wet nurse (Exodus 2:5-9). The princess gives him an Egyptian name, Moses, but ironically this Egyptian woman explains his name in terms of Hebrew -- as reflecting the fact that she  drew out  (Hebrew mashah) Moses from the river water (Exodus 2:10). <br /> <br /> Here we see the cultural cross-currents that many exiles face while living as a cultural minority. They take on foreign names and/or customs while maintaining ties to their own cultures. In this exilic version of the story, Moses' mother can parent her son only secretly, and his name is a mix of the slaveowner's culture (Moses) and a Hebrew reinterpretation of it ( I drew him out of the water ). <br /> <br /> On one level this story of slavery, genocide, exposure, and secret parenting works powerfully as individual drama, but it would have resonated with exiles under forced labor in Babylon. By preserving and revising old narratives about Moses' endangerment as a baby and rescue from the Nile, these exiles could speak, from a safe distance, of their own suffering and hope.  <br /> Like much of the rest of the Old and New Testaments, the Moses story is saturated with experiences of profound suffering. <br /> <br /> That is part of what has made these stories so compelling to diverse communities over the centuries. Characters like Moses reflect the reality of violence faced by many who cherish these texts today. Christian Bale' comments about Moses, the individual, miss the power of these biblical texts about Moses to help generations of communities, past and present, survive such suffering and make sense of it.

"Finding Justice in the  Giving Season "	"Tis the season of giving. Right? From  Giving Tuesday  to Salvation Army bell ringers to frantic online donations or checks postmarked by Dec. 31, charitable giving spikes in December. <a href= http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=1360#.VIijw0ue_rM  target= _hplink >The Network for Good estimates</a> that 30 percent of annual giving occurs in December and 10 percent in the last three days of the year. Not surprisingly, non-profits that address direct service needs like clothing and food also see a spike in volunteerism during the holidays. It's a good feeling to share our own bounty at Christmas -- to help a family buy presents, or serve a meal at a soup kitchen. I do these things with my own family, its part of how we teach our children to love and serve others.<br /> <br /> Charity is one of the foundations of Christianity (along with faith and hope it is considered one of the three theological virtues). The word comes from the Latin  caritas  and is used in Christian theology as a way of describing the nature of God, often translated as  love.  Because it is meant to represent an altruistic love that symbolizes the love people have for others (as in love thy neighbor), we often think about charity as how we act towards others, particularly those who need help. Charity is also foundational to Judaism in the form of <em>tzedakah</em> and to Islam as <em>zakat</em>, or almsgiving. <br /> <br /> <a href= http://www.bls.gov/news.release/volun.nr0.htm  target= _hplink >According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, about 25 percent of Americans volunteered at least once for an organization in 2013. Through our money and our time we tutor children, work in soup kitchens, offer up our houses of worship and community centers for people to shower and sleep. We feed people, cloth people, visit them when they are sick, and do our best to help care for and express of our love, <em>caritas</em>, for our neighbors. <br /> <br /> Charity, however, is not enough to address the deep economic and social problems that face our communities. In addition to giving people clothes and food and helping them find shelter, we need to address the root problems that are causing poverty. We need to focus not just on charity but also on justice. Why? We've all heard the story about teaching people to fish instead of giving them a fish and that begins to get at justice. But what if the pond is polluted and all the fish have died? Or what if there are giant trawlers that have cleaned out all the fish and sold them at a profit, leaving none behind for our fisher to catch and feed his or her family? A justice approach is interested in figuring out why all the fish died and how to make sure that our fisherperson is able to take care of their own needs and the needs of their family. Addressing the root causes of poverty is an essential aspect of effective social change.  <br /> <br /> The crisis of inequality that we face in our country rivals the days of the Robber Barons and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. A serious job and income crisis faces increasing numbers of poor and low-income families in our country. Work that pays a living wage has slowly evaporated from our economy over the last twenty years. Many poor and low-income people are eager and ready for work but their skills are obsolete or their industries have collapsed and the work that they can find doesn't feed their families, or pay their rent, or keep the lights on. <br /> <br /> The number of <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/upshot/unemployment-the-vanishing-male-worker-how-america-fell-behind.html?emc=edit_th_20141212&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=21693736&_r=0&abt=0002&abg=0  target= _hplink >prime-age men (25-54 years old) not working stands at 16 percent </a>, that's triple the number since the late '60s. <a href= http://www.nwlc.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/final_nwlc_lowwagereport2014.pdf  target= _hplink >Two-thirds of low-wage workers are women</a> (defined as $10.10 an hour or less) and one-third of these women are mothers of children under 18.<br /> <br /> Charity is an important and necessary part of a caring society. Charity helps people make it through the hard times and get back on their feet. So, by all means, keep giving food, money and clothes to help folks make through the tough times.<br /> <br /> But don't stop there. <br /> <br /> We need to develop justice responses to the social and economic crises that threaten the well being of our communities. During this Giving Season, think about where you are giving your time and money. In addition to the organizations that offer charity, find and give (time and money) to organizations in your community that are working toward social change. Community development organizations that work in partnership with people from poor and marginalized communities to create innovative justice-oriented solutions to their problems need and deserve your support -- year round. Find these organizations in your local community and give generously. After all, it's the Giving Season. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 15:36:51 -0500"	"religion"

"There Is Nothing Casual About Prejudice: The Popular Podcast 'Serial' and the Notion of Implicit Bias"	"Like <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/07/serial-adnan-syed-family-podcast-interview  target= _hplink >millions</a> of others, I have been an avid listener of the new podcast<em> Serial</em>.  Its <a href= http://serialpodcast.org/  target= _hplink > one story, told week by week  </a>is the true case of Adnan Syed, who was convicted of and is serving life in prison for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee.  Host and executive producer Sarah Koenig analyzes the evidence and lack thereof, transcripts of the interrogations and two trials, and presents recent interviews of witnesses, former classmates, family, jurors, and Adnan himself.  Koenig seems to genuinely vacillate between believing Adnan is innocent and guilty, and early in the podcast she invites listeners to start paying attention if we want to solve this mystery with her.<br /> <br /> Adnan is a Pakistani American, and Hae was Korean American.  The racial and cultural identities of the protagonists have prompted some to <a href= http://www.theawl.com/2014/11/serial-and-white-reporter-privilege  target= _hplink >characterize the podcast as an  immigrant story,  and to criticize</a> Koenig for not grasping many aspects of this narrative.  While I agree with this analysis, I did not think it ultimately compromised Koenig's role as an effective storyteller.  That is, until I heard Episode 10.<br /> <br /> About five minutes into Episode 10, Koenig is interviewing Adnan's mother, who tells Koenig that she believes her son was convicted because he is Muslim.  I was surprised to hear Koenig say right away that she does not believe her.  But then Koenig seems to take a step back by stating that prejudice may have  crept in  and contributed to the way the case was investigated and prosecuted,  advertently or inadvertently.   She goes on to provide striking examples of gratuitous, suggestive, and plainly stereotypical references to Pakistani or Muslim men.  I began to forgive Koenig for immediately dismissing Adnan's mother's perspective when she seemed to get the harm of this prejudice, exclaiming that one can  stir stereotypes into facts, all of which gets baked into a story. <br /> <br /> But then Koenig downplays the injustice that can result from such sordid story making.  About 15 minutes in she says,  Reporting this story I found plenty of examples of casual prejudice against Muslims.   Koenig goes on to cite comments by Adnan's former teachers and interviews of some of the jurors who voted to convict Adnan.  As for the jurors, Koenig presents their claim that while they had stereotypes about Adnan's religion, it  didn't affect their view of the case.   However, Koenig states that when she pressed, it seemed for some of the jurors  stereotypes of Adnan's culture were there, lurking in the background.   She then plays recorded interviews of two jurors who explain that views of how Muslim men treat women seemed to play a part in how some saw the case.  Nonetheless, Koenig switches to discussing Adnan's defense attorney and describes the amount of time the attorney dedicated in the opening statement to explaining Adnan's religion and culture as  nutty. <br /> <br /> The fact that Koenig identifies how racial and cultural stereotypes were present in Adnan's case but then dismisses this as  casual  is frustrating and troubling.  Casual prejudice is not an actual phenomenon.  It is not a defined phrase or term of art.  There is, however, a proven concept called  implicit bias,  and it is currently part of the national discourse in the wake of the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and other Black and Brown civilians killed by police officers.  Referring to <a href= http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/research/understanding-implicit-bias/  target= _hplink > the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner, </a> many are pointing out how implicit bias plays a role in police brutality.  There is the dehumanizing language in <a href= http://time.com/3605346/darren-wilson-michael-brown-demon/  target= _hplink >Darren Wilson's grand jury testimony</a> describing Michael Brown as a  demon  and  Hulk-Hogan like.   There have been discussions about <a href= http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/03/black-boys-older.aspx  target= _hplink >a report </a>released earlier this year revealing that the police perceive young Black men to be less innocent than their White counterparts, and also older than they actually are (the officer who killed 12-year-old Rice thought Rice was 20).  <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/08/across-america-whites-are-biased-and-they-dont-even-know-it/  target= _hplink >A <em>Washington Post</em> article this week</a> discusses an implicit bias study and declares that  across America, Whites are biased and they don't even know it. <br /> <br /> Koenig uses the concept of casual prejudice to cast the biases of jurors and other key actors in Adnan's case as not dispositive -- that it did not ultimately impact the outcome.  It is not clear why Koenig is so certain, but her characterization of the prejudice against Adnan as  casual  calls into question her credibility.  Prejudice is conscious, or it can be implicit.  It is pervasive.  Prejudice in the U.S. <a href= http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet  target= _hplink >incarcerates </a>and <a href= http://www.propublica.org/article/deadly-force-in-black-and-white  target= _hplink >kills</a> people of color at disproportionate rates.

"Spike in Tiny Number of Gay Men on PrEP Abandoning Condoms Hardly Represents 'All' Gay Men"	"<a href= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2014/12/hiv-aids-prep-truvada-condom-gilead-gild.html?s=print  target= _hplink >A Dec. 8 blog post in the <em>San Francisco Business Times</em></a> has sparked another furor over gay men using the HIV drug Truvada to prevent infection with the deadly virus.  San Francisco men shed condoms in favor of Gilead's HIV prevention pill,  alleges the title of <em>SFBT</em> reporter Ron Leuty's opinion piece.<br /> <br /> Leuty reported on a survey of men in a Kaiser Permanente AIDS-prevention program. More than 500 are taking Truvada once a day as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Leuty called the 45-percent increase among men in the study not using condoms  eye-popping  -- which it is. Clearly these men aren't heeding the <a href= http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/guidelines/PrEPguidelines2014.pdf  target= _hplink >Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation</a> to use condoms in addition to taking the drug.<br /> <br /> But it's a serious stretch to project the behavior of about 90 men on PrEP in this one study to  all  gay men in San Francisco, let alone anywhere else. Consider this: All 500 men in the study represent only about 0.007861 of San Francisco's roughly 60,000 or so gay and bisexual men.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there will always be men who push the limits of risk to engage in high-risk sex that is, for them, something of value. Others of us may see it as self-harm, but these guys usually describe it in terms of intimacy and pleasure. Either way, we should be glad these men are making even a partial effort to protect themselves by taking PrEP.<br /> <br /> We can argue all we want about whether PrEP provides cover for dangerous behavior. But we aren't addressing the most important questions: Why do some gay men value high-risk sex more highly than they apparently value their own health? Why do some guys seem unable to value themselves apart from their willingness to engage in  anything goes  sex?<br /> <br /> At risk of getting stuck trying to understand what even mental-health experts would likely classify as aberrant behavior, I would suggest we step back to get a more accurate picture of how the vast majority of gay men conduct their sex lives. Reframe the statistics that can be blown out of proportion to make it look like  all  gay men have stopped using condoms, or even like  all  gay men engage in anal intercourse, which they don't.<br /> <br /> Ron Stall, Director of the LGBT Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh, has identified four interconnected  epidemics  of psychosocial health conditions that disproportionately afflict gay and bisexual men, each one making the other worse: childhood sexual abuse, partner violence, depression, and drug use. Together, their insidious effects are referred to as syndemics. Men who are most strongly affected by any one of these tend to be at high risk for HIV and substance abuse. Those from lower-income or culturally marginalized ethnic groups are especially vulnerable to syndemic effects.<br /> <br /> In <a href= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12773359  target= _hplink >one study</a>, Stall and his colleagues found that 11 percent of 812 men who reported one problem -- depression, for instance -- had engaged in high-risk sex. Of 129 men who reported three or four problems, 23 percent said they had had high-risk sex.<br /> <br /> The numbers are high relative to the so-called general population. But surely no one can be surprised to see self-destructive behavior in people treated as if they don't deserve better. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the numbers tell us something quite astonishing when we look at them from a different angle: that 89 percent of the men reporting one problem did <em>not</em> engage in high-risk sex. Likewise, more than three quarters of the men with three or four problems did <em>not</em> engage in high-risk sex.<br /> <br /> These numbers make it clear: The overwhelming majority of gay men are resilient and take care of, protect, and value ourselves. How can this be? In the face of overwhelming pressures and struggles that can give gay men all the reasons we might need to harm or medicate ourselves, how is it that most of us <em>don't</em>?<br /> <br /> The short answer: We accept ourselves. Research suggests that our journey toward being resilient gay men who accept and value ourselves begins by accepting our sexual orientation -- overcoming our own self-stigma, what we've internalized from the bullies of our lives. Ron Stall told me in an <a href= http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/02/the-power-of-choosing-resilience/273245/?single_page=true  target= _hplink >interview for <em>The Atlantic</em></a>,  Guys who do the best job of resolving internalized homophobia [or self-stigma] are the least likely to have current victimization, substance abuse, and compulsive [high-risk] sex. <br /> <br /> Put a little differently, he said,  Getting a population of people to not hate themselves is good for their health. This is not rocket science.  Building up, and upon, gay men's resilience is a challenge for each of us -- and for our families, lawmakers, ministers, teachers, and anyone else who wishes us to be well and fully contributing members of society. <br /> <br /> The place to start is in revising the way we think. We need to consider carefully how numbers can hurt us when they are taken out of context. Their  eye-popping  shock value dwindles when they're put into perspective against the bigger number of  all  gay men.<br /> <br /> We can hope that gay men who value condomless sex more than they do their own lives will eventually find intimacy and pleasure in sex built upon mutual respect and protection. Until then, PrEP for them is an important step in protecting themselves.<br /> <br /> In the meantime, the vast majority of gay men -- who don't abuse drugs or engage in high-risk sex -- clearly value their health enough not to endanger themselves or their partners.<br /> <br /> Yes it's shocking to realize that <a href= http://sfaf.org/hiv-info/statistics/  target= _hplink >one in four gay men in San Francisco is HIV-positive</a>. <br /> <br /> But it's at least as surprising that 75 percent of gay men in San Francisco are not HIV-positive. What can we learn from them about how they have avoided HIV when the virus is so prevalent in the community? What can their experience show us that might even help the guys taking an expensive, powerful, and toxic drug so they can engage in high-risk sex?<br /> <br /> Among the lessons, one stands out: Just as the way we frame our personal story can make us feel like a victim of our circumstances or a victor over them, so too the way we present statistics  can mean the difference between hope and despair. Increases in condomless sex among a tiny sliver of men already at extreme risk for HIV may be  eye-popping.  But so is the far greater number of gay men who choose to view safer sex as the key to real intimacy and pleasure between men who care about themselves and one another.

"Attorney General Won't Force New York Times Reporter To Reveal Source"	"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has ruled out forcing New York Times reporter James Risen to divulge his source in the upcoming trial of a former CIA officer accused of disclosing government secrets, a person familiar with the matter said Friday night.<br /> <br /> The decision comes ahead of a court hearing set for next week at which Justice Department prosecutors had been directed to reveal whether they plan to seek Risen's testimony. The person briefed on the matter, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the decision had not yet been formally announced, said the Justice Department may still subpoena Risen to answer other questions in the case but would not compel him to disclose the identity of his source.<br /> <br /> Risen's reporting has been at the center of a years-long conflict with the federal government that has contributed to a debate about the line between national security and press freedoms.<br /> <br /> Prosecutors allege that Jeffrey Sterling, who is scheduled for trial next month in federal court in Virginia, was a key source in Risen's 2006 book  State of War,  which detailed a botched CIA effort during the Clinton administration to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. Risen has refused to reveal his sources despite being subpoenaed by the government and did not testify before the federal grand jury that indicted Sterling in 2010.<br /> <br /> The trial has long been delayed while lawyers have debated whether Risen enjoys any kind of immunity from being compelled to testify about his interactions with anonymous sources. In June, the Supreme Court let stand a ruling from a federal appellate court that Risen could be subpoenaed and rejected his bid to get the justices to clarify whether journalists have a right to protect their confidential sources.<br /> <br /> It's not clear what the Justice Department's decision will mean for the case against Sterling, which is set for trial on Jan. 12.<br /> <br />  We are waiting for the formal response as ordered by the court,  one of Sterling's lawyers, Edward MacMahon, wrote in an emailed statement.  If the result is that the Attorney General does not want to issue the subpoena that his own Department of Justice fought for all the way to the Supreme Court, then three years of Mr. Sterling's life have been wasted in litigation. <br /> <br /> Attorney General Eric Holder has said no reporter would be sent to jail for doing his or her job, but he has faced repeated criticism for the Justice Department's handling of national security leak investigations during his tenure.<br /> <br /> In 2013, the government secretly subpoenaed records of telephone lines used by AP journalists as part of its investigation into who leaked information for a 2012 story about a foiled plot in Yemen to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner. The Justice Department also secretly used a warrant to obtain the emails of a Fox News reporter, a decision Holder singled out in October as one he wished  could have been done differently. <br /> <br /> The fallout of those cases led the Justice Department to issue new guidelines for obtaining records from news media organizations in leak investigations.<br /> <br /> In the Risen matter, Holder had said he was optimistic that the situation could be defused in an acceptable way for both sides.<br /> <br /> Earlier this week, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ordered prosecutors to state at a Dec. 16 hearing whether they planned to call Risen as a witness and also asked them to reveal  any conditions or limitations  they had worked out with his attorneys.  She said the Justice Department has had more than six months to decide whether it would subpoena Risen to testify at trial.<br /> <br />  Because Mr. Risen's presence or absence at the trial will have a significant impact on how the parties present their case, a decision about Mr. Risen must be made sufficiently before trial to enable the parties to prepare adequately,  she wrote in the order.<br /> <br /> An email message sent to Risen was not immediately returned.<br /> <br /> The Justice Department's decision was first reported by NBC News.<br /> <br /> ___<br /> <br /> Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP"	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 19:04:43 -0500"	"media"
"'We Tortured Some Folks,' But 'That's Not Who We Are'"	"Last August, President Barack Obama admitted to the press: <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/obama-cia-torture-some-folks-brennan-spying  target= _hplink > we tortured some folks. </a>  But he also added that torturing people  is not who we are.   His CIA director, <a href= http://www.c-span.org/video/?323254-1/cia-director-john-brennan-interrogation-report  target= _hplink >John Brennan</a>, calls the CIA torturers  patriots.  So which is it? Are they  patriots,  deserving of our admiration, or sadists who engaged in acts that are contrary to  who we are? <br /> <br /> The Senate Intelligence Committee's executive summary <a href= https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1376748/sscistudy1.pdf  target= _hplink >report </a> on CIA torture concludes that at least 26 of the people the CIA contractors tortured were <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/middle-east-cia-torture-report_n_6303538.html  target= _hplink >innocent of <a href= http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/12/09/249465/senate-finds-cia-brutalized-terror.html  target= _hplink >any ties</a> to terrorism </a>whatsoever. <br /> <br /> One of the CIA contractors,<a href= http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/11/politics/enhanced-interrogation-architect-speaks/index.html?hpt=hp_t2  target= _hplink > James Mitchell</a>, was on TV lately where he was called the  architect  of the torture program.  His Spokane, Washington company, Mitchell, Jessen, and Associates, <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/world/senate-torture-report-shows-cia-infighting-over-interrogation-program.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >received $81 million</a> in taxpayer money for services rendered.  <br /> <br /> CIA Director<a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/us/politics/cia-director-brennan-torture-report.html  target= _hplink > John Brennan</a> argues that people like Mitchell and his business partner, Bruce Jessen, were doing legitimate intelligence work.  But isn't it also possible that these  patriots  were acting out their post-9/11 revenge fantasies against a bunch of Arabs and Afghans who fell into their clutches about whom they knew very little?<br /> <br /> Mitchell and Jessen had <a href= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2869650/Anti-terror-program-leaders-little-experience.html  target= _hplink >no specialized knowledge</a> of Al Qaeda or international terrorism; they didn't speak Arabic or Pashto, and had no experience interrogating prisoners. <br /> <br /> What <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryancasey/cia-interrogation-program_b_6299398.html  target= _hplink >they did know about </a>as psychologists was how to drill down into the human psyche.  And they knew how to <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/12/us/12psychs.html?pagewanted=all  target= _hplink >reverse engineer </a>the Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) techniques designed to help U.S. personnel counter torturers. They applied the same appalling techniques to their own interrogations. Given their lack of qualifications to head such an endeavor it's likely Mitchell and Jessen were just winging it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Can we get our $81 million back?</strong><br /> <br /> George W. Bush and Dick Cheney might have  authorized  the torture program, but it's still a war crime that violates the <a href= http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html  target= _hplink >Convention Against Torture</a>, the United Nations Charter, the <a href= http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/  target= _hplink >Universal Declaration of Human Rights,</a> and the U.S. Constitution.  Letting the people responsible for torture ride off into the sunset free of any criminal charges throws out the window international and domestic law, as well as almost everything we've learned from the Nuremberg Trials, Hannah Arendt, or the trial of Adolf Eichmann. <br /> <br /> One of the CIA's <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/rise-and-fall-of-cias-overseas-prisons-traced-in-senate-report-on-interrogations/2014/12/11/067232b4-8143-11e4-9f38-95a187e4c1f7_story.html  target= _hplink > black  (secret) torture sites </a>was located at Guantanamo, which should raise some thorny legal issues because, unlike Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Afghanistan, or Thailand, the Supreme Court has ruled that<a href= http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/the_obama_gitmo_myth/  target= _hplink > Guantanamo is considered  U.S. soil.  </a> <br /> <br /> Absent any criminal prosecutions, the only conclusion we will be left with is that these guys really are  patriots  and torturing people really is  who we are.   But we shouldn't need  experts  like <a href= http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2014/12/10/the-torture-report-and-american-values/  target= _hplink >Max Boot</a>, <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/feb/04/usa.afghanistan  target= _hplink >Joe Klein</a>, or other apologists for torture to judge the morality of turning to torturers posing as  doctors  to root out suspected terrorists.  <br /> <br /> The morality and ethics of whether or not the CIA can torture people in our name are non-negotiable. There is no argument that can be made to justify this atrocity. The corporate media are treating torture as if it's just another  issue  like immigration reform or the federal budget. It isn't. You cannot justify the unjustifiable. People who attempt to apologize for torture done in their name are embarrassing themselves; raising their heads to be counted as <a href= http://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/208  target= _hplink >barbarians</a> at the gate. <br /> <br /> We don't fight against terrorists to become more like them, but to maintain our differences.  And after all of the criticism the Arab and Islamic world has gotten for being behind the West in embracing the Enlightenment from the <a href= http://www.salon.com/2014/11/21/reza_aslan_sam_harris_and_new_atheists_arent_new_arent_even_atheists/  target= _hplink >Sam Harrises</a> and <a href= http://www.salon.com/2014/10/12/bill_mahers_horrible_excuse_why_his_defense_of_islamophobia_just_doesnt_make_any_sense/  target= _hplink >Bill Mahers</a>, our own government tossed out any semblance of Enlightenment thinking against torturing prisoners going back to <a href= http://gradstudentmadness.blogspot.com/2005/11/voltaire-on-torture.html  target= _hplink >Voltaire</a> and Beccaria. <br /> <br /> Not long ago <a href= http://www.alandershowitz.com/publications/docs/torturewarrants.html  target= _hplink >Alan Dershowitz </a>was advocating  torture warrants,  whereby judges could issue a legal justification for torture.  I suppose that would be better than what we had: the CIA acting in secret and employing contractors to torture people willy-nilly.  <br /> <br /> Mitchell and Jessen and their underlings weren't going after any  ticking time bombs.   They wanted to use coercion to get the names of other potential bad guys. The Senate report shows that they routinely kept prisoners in solitary confinement in a dark hole for up to <a href= http://globalnews.ca/news/1717407/how-the-cia-tortured-its-guinea-pig-detainee-abu-zubaydah/  target= _hplink >47 days</a> just to  soften them up  before asking them any questions.  So much for disarming the  ticking time bomb.   The report also shows that any real intelligence gleaned from the interrogations came <em>before</em> prisoners were subjected to torture.   <br /> <br /> One of the <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-worst-findings-waterboard-rectal  target= _hplink >creepiest revelations </a>from the Senate report is the description of a torturer who has broken down one of his subjects through water-boarding and other  techniques  to the point where he can merely raise an eyebrow or snap his fingers and that broken human being would willingly go over to the water board and strap himself in. That's straight out of Orwell's <em>1984</em>.  <br /> <br /> Mitchell and Jessen (and a number of other agents who are still receiving government salaries) engaged in  interrogating  their prisoners with beatings, stress positions, sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, dark and cold or light and hot environments, rectal feeding, rectal hydration, sensory overload or sensory deprivation, and any other humiliating abuse that leapt into their imaginations.<br /> <br /> One prisoner under their charge <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/09/the-most-gruesome-moments-in-the-cia-torture-report.html  target= _hplink >died of hypothermia </a>on a cold concrete floor after being shackled to a post stripped of his pants.      <br /> <br /> The torture report sort of gave the country another  teachable moment.   But will we learn anything other than how <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/11/jon-stewart-awesome-andrea-tantaros_n_6306844.html  target= _hplink > awesome </a> is the United States?<br /> <br /> In recent news cycles since the report was made public we've seen the corporate media clearly go in <a href= http://fair.org/take-action/action-alerts/equal-time-for-torturers/  target= _hplink >damage control mode.</a>  The networks and cable TV stations apparently see it as their responsibility to provide journalistic  balance,  as if torture is just another  issue  to bloviate about with talking points and a bifurcated  pro  and  con  frame.  They bring on their shows people like former CIA director <a href= http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/michael-hayden-cia-rectal-rehydration-113515.html  target= _hplink >Michael Hayden </a>(who has lied to Congress) and other torture apologists and propagandists to spin the story out of existence.<br /> <br /> During the George W. Bush years there was a brief public debate about whether or not waterboarding was  torture.   The late <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/02/ivanity-fairis-christophe_n_110444.html  target= _hplink >Christopher Hitchens</a>, who was an important intellectual cheerleader for the Iraq War and an advocate for an aggressive  war on terror  wasn't convinced that waterboarding was torture so he agreed to have it done to him.  A few other reporters also willingly subjected themselves to waterboarding as a publicity stunt to  see what it was like.   I doubt if any pro-torture reporter or intellectual would agree to undergo rectal feeding as Hitchens did with waterboarding to find out if it's really  torture.   We won't see <a href= http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/12/torture-party-republicans.html  target= _hplink >Dick Cheney </a>on teevee with a blender and an enema bag any time soon.  <br /> <br /> <strong>I'll ask again: Can we get our $81 million back?</strong><br /> <br /> The United States claims to uphold  universal  values such as democracy and human rights while trampling the principle of  universalism,  which holds that all nations, big or small, powerful or weak, must respect international law.  Allowing CIA career employees or contractors to get away with torturing people free from legal accountability telegraphs to the rest of the world that the United States reserves unto itself the right to commit war crimes.<br /> <br /> Back in the 1920s and 1930s, the <a href= http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-mussolini  target= _hplink >Italian fascists</a> used to attack the gastrointestinal tracts of their left-wing opponents by pouring castor oil down their throats or administering castor oil enemas.  Rectal feeding to punish and humiliate has been around for a while; but the trains ran on time.  <br /> <br /> Since it appears that the CIA torturers never will be brought to justice it makes it more likely that sometime in the future, with the nation facing a new peril, a different cast of  patriots  might direct these kinds of  enhanced interrogation techniques  closer to home.  Maybe next time their targets won't be foreigners suspected of terrorism but will be American citizens who hold political views they don't like.  And the black sites, instead of being located in places like Lithuania or Poland, might be in Peoria or Tulsa. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 17:18:46 -0500"	"media"
"Conflicts of Interest in Coverage of a Health Issue by the New York Times"	"In recent days, employees of <em>The New York Times</em> have posted no fewer than three pieces on the newspaper's website, asserting that the risk of harm from the electromagnetic fields (EMF) given off by power lines is negligible, and that fears of it are unfounded. Among the postings is a seven-minute <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/health/long-after-an-80s-scare-suspicion-of-power-lines-prevails.html  target= _hplink >video</a> produced by Kyra Darnton for Retro Report, entitled  Long After an 80's Scare, Suspicion of Power Lines Prevails.  An accompanying article with the same title has been posted by a reporter for Retro Report named Clyde Haberman, and a third <a href= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/a-fresh-look-at-power-lines-cancer-and-the-dread-to-risk-ratio/  target= _hplink >piece</a> entitled  A Fresh Look at Power Lines, Cancer and the Dread-to-Risk Ratio  has been put up by a reporter for the newspaper named Andrew C. Revkin.<br /> <br /> The video produced by Darnton and some colleagues at Retro Report relies preponderantly on the testimony of two researchers -- David Savitz, who is vice-president for research at Brown University, and John Moulder, director of radiation biology at the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Medical College of Wisconsin.<br /> <br /> Early in <a href= http://microwavenews.com/news-center/times-retroreport-power-lines  target= _hplink >his career</a>, Savitz conducted studies showing that children living in homes near power lines were developing leukemia twice as often as children who did not live in such homes. Later, he received a five-million-dollar contract from the Electric Power Research Institute -- an organization financed by the electric utility industry -- to study the risk of cancer among electric utility workers. Savitz found an increased risk of brain tumors in these workers, but he subsequently renounced this finding and challenged similar findings on the part of other researchers. He also renounced his finding of increased leukemia in children exposed to power-line electromagnetic fields, and challenged similar findings by other researchers. In Darnton's video, he declares,  it's quite questionable whether these fields cause leukemia at all. <br /> <br /> Savitz has every right to renounce his work on electromagnetic fields, and to challenge the validity of studies conducted by other researchers, but is it good journalistic practice for Darnton and her colleagues at <em>The Times</em> to omit any mention of the fact that he has received heavy financing from the electric utility industry?<br /> <br /> John Moulder, who, like Savitz, also plays a leading role in Darnton's video, tells its viewers that the  Current state of the science says power lines cannot be a major public health hazard.  <br /> <br /> Moulder has every right to express such an opinion, but is it good journalistic practice for Darnton and her colleagues to omit any mention of the fact that he has testified repeatedly as a <a href= http://microwavenews.com/news-center/%E2%80%9Cradiation-research%E2%80%9D-and-cult-negative-results#Moulder  target= _hplink >paid consultant</a> for the electric utility industry that electromagnetic fields given off by power lines do not pose any health risk?<br /> <br /> As for Moulder's assessment of the current state of scientific research regarding the power-line health hazard, how in the name of any claim to objectivity could Darnton and her colleagues omit mention of a <a href= http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs322/en/  target= _hplink >report</a> issued by a panel of scientists convened by the prestigious International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), in Lyon, France, whose twenty-five members reviewed the findings of dozens of studies of childhood leukemia victims and the proximity of where they lived to power lines, and concluded unanimously that power-frequency magnetic fields are  possibly carcinogenic to humans ? (Among the members of the panel were representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the National Radiological Protection Board, the Yale University Medical School, and the World Health Organization.) <br /> <br /> The answer to this question is that Darnton and her colleagues did not try to find out if there was any evidence to cast doubt upon the conclusion that exonerates power-line electromagnetic fields of posing any health risk. If they had seen fit to contact me -- the author of half a dozen articles about the EMF hazard in <em>The New Yorker</em> -- or Louis Slesin, the editor and publisher of <a href= http://microwavenews.com/  target= _hplink >Microwave News</a> -- a meticulously researched newsletter that has carried information about the health hazards posed by EMFs and microwave radiation for more than thirty years -- they could easily have learned about the conflicts of interest that may well taint the views of Savitz and Moulder, as well as about the unanimous findings of the IARC report.<br /> <br /> (Disclosure: I appear in Darnton's video giving a three-second answer to a question asked by Tex Koppel during a <em>Nightline</em> program about EMFs that aired back in the early 1990s. Both Louis Slesin and I have written letters to Margaret Sullivan, Public Editor of <em>The Times</em>, pointing out the conflicts of interest on the part of Savitz and Moulder, and the necessity of acknowledging such conflicts when reporting on public health issues.)<br /> <br /> This is not the only time that <em>The New York Times</em> has failed to inform its readers adequately about the existence of a major public health risk. During a twenty-year period between the 1960s and 1980s, I wrote a number of articles for <em>The New Yorker</em> about the massive health hazard posed by exposure to asbestos, as well as the extensive toxic tort litigation being brought in jurisdictions around the nation by sick and dying asbestos workers and the families of dead workers against asbestos manufacturers, who had concealed the hazard for half a century -- in some cases, neglecting to inform their workers when X-ray examinations revealed that they had developed fatal lung disease. During that whole period, <em>The Times</em> carried articles about the asbestos problem on its business pages, and often referred to asbestos as an  alleged carcinogen,  thus conferring legal rights upon a mineral that had killed or disabled tens of thousands of American workers, and been shown to be the most important industrial cause of cancer in the world. Moreover, <em>The Times</em> invariably  balanced  the findings of researchers whose studies had demonstrated that asbestos was carcinogenic with denials issued by researchers financed by the asbestos industry. <br /> <br /> Only when the nation's largest asbestos company, Johns-Manville, filed for bankruptcy on August 26, 1982 -- an event brought about because juries around the nation had found the company guilty of outrageous and reckless misconduct, and levied millions of dollars in punitive damages against it -- did the story find its way to the front page of <em>The Times</em>.<br /> <br /> A day later, an editorial writer for the newspaper proved to be so ignorant of the fifty-year cover-up of asbestos disease by the nation's asbestos manufacturers that he compared the human agony they had visited upon their workers with the fiscal uncertainty besetting them.  Asbestos is a tragedy,  he wrote,  most of all for the victims and their families but also for companies, which are being made to pay the price for decisions made long ago. <br /> <br /> Asbestos proved to be a powerful carcinogen that inflicted cancer and other disease upon workers who inhaled its fibers in occupational settings. It also posed a health hazard for people in the general population, who were exposed to asbestos insulation that had been sprayed as fireproofing on the girders of buildings -- a practiced now banned nationwide.  Studies of power-frequency electromagnetic fields show them to be are a far weaker carcinogen than asbestos, but also demonstrate that they pose a cancer hazard for telephone linemen, electric utility workers, and workers exposed to EMF emanating from electrically powered equipment and machinery. As for children and people in the general population, a glance along any street in the United States should be sufficient to show that power-line EMFs are ubiquitous in the environment, and to serve as a warning that their potential to cause widespread harm should not be ignored or denied.<br /> <br /> One might have hoped that <em>The Times</em> had learned by now to inform its readers about conflicts of interest that could skew the accuracy of its reports on matters relating to the public health. However, judging from Darnton's video and the pieces by Haberman and Revkin, who have rubber stamped its flawed conclusions, one would have been mistaken to do so.<br /> <br /> One might hope that in the future <em>The Times</em> will inform its readers regarding conflicts of interest in people it presents as reliable sources, so readers may make better-informed decisions about the information being transmitted to them.<br /> <br /> Don't bet on it.

"5 Tips to Improve Your Campus Rape-Reporting Experience"	"Everyone seems to give women great--and by  great  we mean terrible--<a href= http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/20/justice/colorado-rape-prevention-guidelines/  target= _hplink >advice these days</a> for how to prevent college rape. And as you probably know, college rape isn't abating--indeed, it seems a new story breaks weekly that's more horrifying than the last. Because there's a good chance that you or someone you know will be raped while you're in college, we decided to provide some actually useful advice. <br /> <br /> Since reporting rape is unfortunately an activity with which both of us (<a href= http://the-toast.net/2014/09/16/counted-reporting-rape-school-title-ix-investigation/  target= _hplink >Katie</a> and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/annie-e-clark/why-i-am-filing-an-office_b_2489641.html  target= _hplink >Annie</a>) are familiar, we've compiled our own list of  tips  for when you or a friend is ready to report your rape. <br /> <br /> <em>Content Warning: The following tips may look shockingly similar to the terrible advice that women are routinely given to avoid getting raped. That's on purpose.<br /> </em><br /> <strong>1. Put on your Rape-Reporting Face</strong><br /> <br /> Since your <a href= http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=6065  target= _hplink >anti-rape face</a> failed to prevent your rape, it's time to work on your rape-reporting face. A rape-reporting face must convey a variety of emotions at once, so getting it right is going to take some practice. You must look sad, but not so weepy that you're unreliable. You must seem frightened, but not so frightened that you might have traumatic memory loss. If you come across too cold, your listeners might think you're inventing the rape because you're vengeful. <br /> <br /> If you cry too much and seem out of control, you might be <a href= http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=authors/angie-epifano  target= _hplink >headed for a psychiatric facility</a>. This is why we recommend the ten-to-twenty tear rule. Keep your number of tears in the ten-to-twenty range, and you'll be fine.<br /> <br /> If figuring out the correct rape-reporting face seems difficult, you're right! Basically, it's nearly impossible to get a rape-reporting face right unless you're Meryl Streep with multiple Oscars. You should still try, though, because how you come across to the police and school administrators often determines whether they take your case seriously. Be sure to <a href= http://mic.com/articles/102980/college-tells-female-students-to-practice-their-anti-rape-faces-in-the-mirror  target= _hplink >practice in the mirror</a> before you go. <br /> <br /> <strong>2. Dress Appropriately </strong><br /> <br /> Nothing you were wearing last night, not even your <a href= http://www.buzzfeed.com/alisonvingiano/these-college-students-are-making-a-nail-polish-that-changes  target= _hplink >anti-rape nail polish</a>, could prevent your rape. <br /> <br /> Now you need to think about what to wear when you report your rape. Definitely avoid yoga pants and dresses. You won't want to feel like anyone is looking at your body because after you are raped you will want to feel like you are dead. Additionally, if you  look pretty,  the people at the rape reporting office might say that  you were asking for it  and tell you to dress more modestly. <br /> <br /> Remember this rule: Old sweats = rape wear. Find the largest, most shapeless sweatsuit that you can, ideally one cut for a man. Furthermore, the sweatshirt will need to be of the hoodie variety. That way, when you <a href= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/06/is-columbia-failing-campus-rape-victims.html  target= _hplink >pass your rapist on campus</a>, you can pull up your hood and hide your face.<br /> <br /> Don't have a hoodie? It's OK! University police have suggested that <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/21/uconn-sexual-assault-complaint_n_4133713.html  target= _hplink >certain hats</a> work just as well for fending off unwanted attention from rapists. <br /> <br /> <strong>3. Bring a Buddy</strong><br /> <br /> The <a href= http://safercampus.org/userfiles/file/NASummaryReport.pdf  target= _hplink >buddy system</a> obviously failed you when you got raped. Where was your buddy during your date with the guy you thought was kind and trustworthy? Couldn't she have sat on the edge of the bed and read <em>Marie Claire</em> while you guys got it on and made sure nothing rapey happened? <br /> <br /> Well, too late now. It's time to break out the rape-reporting buddy system. Reporting your rape is easier when you bring a friend. But what friend should you bring? This is a tough decision. Let's start with your buddy's sex--do you bring a girl friend or a guy friend? You're going to be talking with total strangers about violent sexual acts that happened to your body. Having a guy friend there might make you even more uncomfortable. But, people listen to men--men have  <a href= http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/katie-couric-some-said-i-lacked-gravitas-which-ive-since-decided-is-latin-for-testicles_b128981  target= _hplink >gravitas</a> --so bringing along a guy might make your rape report more credible.<br /> <br /> But if talking about sex acts in front of a guy friend is just too much for your post-assault-self to handle (it was for us), then you have to select a girl friend. But which one? Your friend who could take on three drunk guys in a bar with her bare hands and leave them crying on the floor? She'll stand up for you if you get bullied during the reporting process. But--here's a strange thing--college administrators are secretly afraid of you. You can make their school look bad or <a href= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/11/university_of_virginia_gang_rape_investigation_rolling_stone_reveals_limits.html  target= _hplink >start a media firestorm</a>, which is their worst nightmare. Bringing an intimidating friend along might actually make them be less helpful to you. <br /> <br /> So do you bring your quiet, meeker friend, who will let you do all the talking and hold your hand? She's loyal and kind. But what happens when they blame you and ask you how rape is possible <a href= http://jezebel.com/23-students-file-complaint-against-columbia-for-mishand-1567215473  target= _hplink >without proper lubrication</a>? Will she stand up for you? <br /> <br /> If you're starting to feel like you can't win, that's because you can't! Administrators really don't want to hear about you being raped. They wish it didn't happen almost as much as you do--just for different reasons. They might try to talk you out of reporting to the police. They might try to convince you that it didn't happen like you thought it did--especially if your rapist is <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/16/sports/errors-in-inquiry-on-rape-allegations-against-fsu-jameis-winston.html?_r=0  target= _hplink >a famous athlete</a>. <br /> <br /> So whatever you do, don't go alone. <br /> <br /> <strong>4. Ask for a Better Rape Whistle</strong><br /> <br /> You will want to show the people at the campus rape reporting office that you are serious about not making yourself a target. So ask for a better rape whistle. According to at least one college, the best rape whistles are made of a  <a href= http://www.knox.edu/offices/campus-safety/about-the-department/safety-and-education-programs  target= _hplink >high-quality brass</a>.  If you blew yours before your rape, and no one came to your aid, perhaps it was because of your whistle's poor metallurgy. Request a high-quality brass whistle right away. <br /> <br /> Reminder: Be sure to also ask whether you will be subject to  disciplinary action  for blowing the whistle outside of a narrow band of what your school's administrators perceive to be  threats.  After all, you don't want to get in trouble for violating a whistle policy. As a rape victim, you already have enough to deal with (like victim-blaming, slut-shaming, and terrible hearing procedures).<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Replenish Yourself After Being  Used Up </strong><br /> <br /> Feeling  used up  after being raped? Apparently using up women is totally normal--normal enough to talk about during a male university president's <a href= https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/11/10/debate-over-university-presidents-comments-rape  target= _hplink >convocation speech to female students</a>.<br /> <br /> So, after being used up, it's time to replenish! You have two ways to go here: there's wine, and then there's ice cream. Both work. We recommend having an ample supply of each on hand for post-rape emergencies. <br /> <br /> For example, you might get an email from your school telling you how much they  care,  but there's nothing they can do about your rape. Therefore, you will have to see your rapist on campus every day for the <a href= http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/09/emma-sulkowicz-campus-sexual-assault-activism.html  target= _hplink >rest of your college career</a>. A container of chocolate chip cookie dough or mint chocolate chip is usually the best way to replenish after seeing one's attacker, whereas Belgian chocolate tends to be a better choice in <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/11/unc-sexual-assault-report-false-charges_n_3049031.html  target= _hplink >cases of retaliation</a>.<br /> <br /> Pro-tip: Avoid the Cabernet on the day of your rape-reporting, as it's best not to be tipsy when you report your rape. Your listeners already tend to not believe you, since, you know, <a href= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/06/why_cops_don_t_believe_rape_victims_and_how_brain_science_can_solve_the.html  target= _hplink >hardly anyone believes rape victims</a>. Plus, school administrators love to <a href= http://www.buzzfeed.com/franciswhittaker/college-president-blames-sex-assaults-on-too-much-alcohol-an  target= _hplink >blame rapes on alcohol</a>--instead of on rapists--so don't give them any extra chances to do so. Dulling the pain with a little vintage should be saved for after the meeting. <br /> <br /> Of course, we sincerely hope that you never need to use our list of helpful tips. But if you do find yourself needing to report a sexual assault some day, perhaps the list will come in handy--at least as handy as all of the terrible how-to-not-get-raped advice that we've all been given lately.<br /> <br /> <em>Co-Authored by Annie E.

But that one stroke of the pen doesn't match up with the rest of his actions. </p><br /> <br /> <p>The ethos of this administration has been to <a href= http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/01/obama-leaves-do/  target= _blank  >look forward and not backwards</a>.

Obama may not want to dwell on the past, but history will, and his legacy on torture will be one of acceptance.</p><br /> <br /> <iframe class= js-hplive-frame   width= 570  height= 381  frameborder= 0  ></iframe><script type= text/javascript >(function(){var src_url= http://embed.live.huffingtonpost.com/HPLEmbedPlayer/?segmentId=548b40012b8c2a0fd80001e4&sid=577&showPlaylist=true&autoPlay=false&amp;onVideoDataLoaded=HPTrack.Vid.DL&amp;onTimeUpdate=HPTrack.Vid.TC ;if (typeof(commercial_video) ==  object ) {src_url +=  &amp;siteSection= +commercial_video.site_and_category;if (commercial_video.package) {src_url +=  &amp;sponsorship= +commercial_video.package;}}var iframe = document.querySelector( .js-hplive-frame );iframe.src = src_url;iframe.className=  ;})();</script>  "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 16:23:40 -0500"	"media"
"Obama Opts For ESPN Over Cable News In The Morning"	"President Barack Obama does not start his mornings off by devouring the latest political headlines from CNN, Fox News or MSNBC. No, the president gets enough of that during the day. Instead, like so many American's seeking solace from reports of war, disease and government gridlock, Obama turns to ESPN.  <br /> <br /> On Friday, during an interview with Colin Cowherd on ESPN Radio's  The Herd,  the president -- between plugging the Affordable Care Act and mentioning the importance of professional athletes speaking out on critical issues -- made sure he let listeners know just how much he loves watching sports. <br /> <br /> “I spend most of my time watching ESPN in the morning,” Obama said, adding that he watches  Sports Center  while working out. “I get so much politics I don’t want to be inundated with a bunch of chatter about politics during the day.”<br /> <br /> In October, former White House press secretary <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/27/jay-carney-obama-cable-news-printed-word_n_6054190.html  target= _hplink >Jay Carney divulged</a> that Obama doesn't bother watching the big cable news channels, but he somehow failed to mention that  Sports Center  makes up the majority of the president's morning news diet.

"The Bogus Defense of 'Enhanced Interrogations'"	"Despite irrefutable evidence in the Senate Intelligence Committee report that the CIA engaged in grotesque acts of torture in the years after 9/11, a group of former CIA directors and officials have taken to the airwaves to claim these actions were justified as a legally authorized program of  enhanced interrogations.   <br /> <br /> Whatever the intentions of the beltway creators of this program, we now know that, right from the beginning, the program used illegal forms of torture.<br /> <br /> The country would be well served if the CIA and its defenders would acknowledge this truth, apologize for what happened, and support laws to ensure it does not happen again. Continued advocacy for the discredited concept of  enhanced interrogations  is only compounding the damage to the United States that has resulted from this program and the decade-long controversy about it.<br /> <br /> From the beginning, the concept of  enhanced interrogations  was based on the flawed view that it is possible to distinguish between legal and illegal uses of violence during interrogations.  Virtually everything we know about human psychology and the nature of bureaucracies provided ample warning that once violence was introduced into the process -- the interrogations would devolve to torture.   <br /> <br /> And that is what occurred.  <br /> <br /> For example, the CIA assured the Justice Department that  enhanced interrogations  would begin initially using the least coercive forms of violence and psychological distress techniques.  But in the field, this guideline was immediately disregarded. Interrogators quickly escalated right up to the harsh techniques of sleep deprivation, requiring detainees to stand in place for hours, and the  confinement  box.  <br /> <br /> Promised limitations on the  enhanced  methods were also exceeded.  If one simulated drowning would not cause  prolonged mental harm,  the interrogators reasoned, then how could 2, or 10 or 183 (the number of times Khalid Sheik Mohammed faced this practice)? If it was okay to place a detainee in a box with insects (a practice the Justice Department authorized), then why would it be impermissible to engage in  rectal feeding  (a medically unnecessary practice the Senate report says was used on detainees).  <br /> <br /> The original sin, therefore, was to authorize the use of violence and intentional infliction of mental distress in the first place. The entire list of horribles in the Senate report followed from this initial lapse in judgment by the president and his top advisors.<br /> <br /> Nonetheless, the CIA's defenders continue to claim that the CIA acted appropriately because the program had been ordered by the president and certified as legal by the Department of Justice.  <br /> <br /> It is important to remember that the legal opinions authorizing the program were written by the White House's cherry-picked lawyer, John Yoo, who ignored all the venerable traditions of the Justice Department regarding vetting of its analysis with legal experts throughout the government.  Many civilian and military lawyers in the Department of Defense, with far more expertise than Yoo in matters relating to interrogation law, made clear that his legal opinions were flat out wrong. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a constitutional scholar to recognize that the memos were absurd on their face. Pages and pages of the analysis were comprised of a lawyer sitting at his desk in Washington attempting to determine whether the amount of physical and psychological pain resulting from an  enhanced interrogation  technique on a detainee, of unknown physical condition, in a cell 5,000 miles away, was  severe.   The perversion is even deeper when you consider that approval of the program by the Justice Department rested on assurances that doctors -- pledged by oath and law to heal the sick -- would be on site to regulate how much pain and psychological distress could be imposed on a detainee without causing  prolonged mental harm.    <br /> <br /> The fact that CIA personnel relied on the defective Justice Department memos is good reason to absolve individual interrogators of criminal liability. But it is not a justification for former CIA directors, officials, and agents to be defending the merits of the program. True, these were extraordinary times. But the program the CIA constructed and urged the president to approve was ethically and morally corrupted to its very core.   <br /> <br /> Instead of doubling down on the defense of this program, now would have been the time to admit mistakes and urge the country and the world to think about how the CIA can contribute to addressing the multiple, serious security challenges facing the world. The United States cannot lead the world if it condones the use of torture. It is unclear why the patriots who led the U.S. government and the CIA through the trauma of 9/11 and its immediate aftermath, fail to recognize this. "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 14:52:32 -0500"	"media"

"'Both Sides' Are Wrong: Torture Did Work -- to Produce Lies for War (See Footnote 857 of Report)"	"<em>This post first appeared on the author's <a href= http://husseini.posthaven.com/what-both-sides-are-ignoring-torture-did-work-to-produce-war-see-footnote-857-of-report  target= _hplink >blog</a>. </em><br /> <br /> Nothing solidifies the establishment more than a seemingly raging debate between two wings of it in which they are both wrong. Not only wrong, but in their wrongness, helping to cover their joint iniquities, all the while engaging in simultaneous embrace and fingerpointing to convey the illusion of debate and choice.<br /> <br /> Such is the case with the  debate  on whether torture  worked  following the release of the Select Committee on Intelligence report on the CIA's  Detention and Interrogation Program.  <br /> <br /> On the one side, we have among others Dianne Feinstein:  The big finding is that torture doesn't work and shouldn't be employed by our country  <a href= http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/torture-doesnt-work-big-takeaway-cia-report-sen-feinstein  >she told PBS</a>. Similarly, a headline in the <i>Hill</i> tells us:  <a href= http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/226476-mccain-i-know-from-personal-experience-torture-doesnt-work  >McCain: 'I know from personal experience' torture doesn't work</a>. <br /> <br /> Then, we have six former directors and deputy directors of the CIA <a href= http://www.wsj.com/articles/cia-interrogations-saved-lives-1418142644  >claiming</a> the  interrogation program   saved thousands of lives  by helping to capture al-Qaeda members. On this score, the Intelligence Committee report seems to have the goods, quoting CIA emails. While the former CIA directors claim a string successes based on torture:  KSM [Khalid Sheik Muhammed] then led us to Riduan Isamuddin, aka Hambali, East Asia's chief al Qaeda ally and the perpetrator of the 2002 Bali bombing in Indonesia -- in which more than 200 people perished.  But the report quotes CIA officials internal emails:  <a href= http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/10/us-senate-rejects-cia-claims-torture-key-capture-bali-bombings-suspect  >Frankly, we stumbled onto Hambali</a>. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean Feinstein and McCain are right and that's the end of story. The truth is that torture did work, but not the way its defenders claim. It worked to produce justifications for policies the establishment wanted, like the Iraq war. This is actually tacitly acknowledged in the report -- or one should say, it's buried in it. <a href= https://twitter.com/samhusseini/status/542435002420432898  >Footnote 857</a> of the report is about Ibn Shaykh al-Libi, who was captured in Afghanistan shortly after the U.S. invasion and was interrogated by the FBI. He told them all he knew, but then the CIA rendered him to the brutal Mubarak regime in Egypt, in effect outsourcing their torture. From the footnote: <br /> <br />  Ibn Shaykh al-Libi reported while in [censored: 'Egyptian'] custody that Iraq was supporting al-Qa'ida and providing assistance with chemical and biological weapons. Some of this information was cited by Secretary Powell in his speech at the United Nations, and was used as a justification for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Ibn Shaykh al-Libi recanted the claim after he was rendered to CIA custody on February [censored], 2003, claiming that he had been tortured by the [censored, likely 'Egyptians'], and only told them what he assessed they wanted to hear. For more more details, see Volume III.  Of course, Volume III has not been made public.<br /> <br /> So, while CIA head John Brennan now says it's  unknowable  if torture led to information that actually saved lives, it's provable that torture led to information that helped lead to war and destroyed lives. <br /> <br /> Nor was al-Libi the only one tortured to try to make the case for war. Many have reported that CIA interrogators waterboarded two alleged top al Qaeda detainees <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/20detain.html  target= _hplink >repeatedly</a> -- Abu Zubaydah at least 83 times and Khalid Sheik Muhammed 183 times -- but few give the exact timing and context: They were so tortured in August 2002 and March 2003 respectively -- the beginning and end of the Bush administration's push for the invasion of Iraq.<br /> <br /> This was somewhat acknowledged in the other Senate report on torture, released by the Armed Services Committee in 2008. It <a href= http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/04/21/66622_report-abusive-tactics-used-to.html?rh=1  target= _hplink >quoted</a> Maj. Paul Burney, who worked as a psychiatrist at Guantanamo Bay prison:  A large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq and we were not successful. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish that link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.  The GTMO Interrogation Control Element Chief, David Becker told the Armed Services Committee he was urged to use more aggressive techniques, being <a href= http://documents.nytimes.com/report-by-the-senate-armed-services-committee-on-detainee-treatment#p=72  target= _hplink >told at one point</a>  the office of Deputy Secretary of Defense [Paul] Wolfowitz had called to express concerns about the insufficient intelligence production at GTMO. <br /> <br /> McClatchy <a href= http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/04/21/66622_report-abusive-tactics-used-to.html?rh=1#storylink=cpy  target= _hplink >reported</a> Sen. Carl Levin, the chair of the Armed Services Committee, said at that time:  I think it's obvious that the administration was scrambling then to try to find a connection, a link (between al Qaida and Iraq) ... They made out links where they didn't exist.  But now, Levin seems more muted, saying, in <a href= http://www.levin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/levin-floor-statement-on-intelligence-committees-report-on-cia-detention-and-interrogation#sthash.uVo6LEZy.dpuf  target= _hplink >response to the release of the recent report</a>, that false information leads to  time-consuming wild goose chases  -- which is quite an understatement given the human horrors that have resulted from the invasion of Iraq.<br /> <br /> So, contrary to the claim that torture helped save lives, torture helped build the case of lies for war that took thousands of U.S. lives and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives, helping to plunge the region into astounding violence, bringing al-Qaeda into Iraq, leading to the rise of ISIS and further bloody wars. As Arianna Huffington <a href= https://twitter.com/ariannahuff/status/542768791642722304  >noted</a>:  A perfect circle: Torture helps start Iraq War, which in turn gives us more people to torture. <a href= https://twitter.com/search?q=%23happyhumanrightsday&amp;src=hash  target= _blank  >#happyhumanrightsday</a> <br /> <br /> This oversight perhaps shouldn't come as too big a shock given who's calling the shots in Washington: Feinstein and McCain both voted for the Iraq war authorization in 2002, as did virtually everyone running foreign policy atop the Obama administration: VP Joe Biden, Pentagon heads Robert Gates and Chuck Hagel and Secs. of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.<br /> <br /> Some have made an issue of videos of torture being destroyed -- but it's been widely assumed that they were destroyed simply because of the potentially graphic nature of the abuse. But there's another distinct possibility: They were destroyed because of the questions they document being asked. Do the torturers ask:  Is there another terrorist attack?  Or do they compel:  Tell us that Iraq and Al-Qaeda are working together. ? The video evidence to answer that question has apparently been destroyed -- with barely anyone raising the possibility of that being the reason. <br /> <br /> Exploiting false information has been well understood within the government. Here's a 2002 memo from the military's Joint Personnel Recovery Agency to the Pentagon's top lawyer -- it debunks the  ticking time bomb  scenario and acknowledged how false information derived from torture can be useful: <br /> <br /> <blockquote>The requirement to obtain information from an uncooperative source as quickly as possible -- in time to prevent, for example, an impending terrorist attack that could result in loss of life -- has been forwarded as a compelling argument for the use of torture ... The error inherent in this line of thinking is the assumption that, through torture, the interrogator can extract reliable and accurate intelligence. History and a consideration of human behavior would appear to refute this assumption. </blockquote><br /> The document concludes: <blockquote>The application of extreme physical and/or psychological duress (torture) has some serious operational deficits, most notably, the potential to result in unreliable information. This is not to say that the manipulation of the subject's environment in an effort to dislocate their expectations and induce emotional responses is not effective. On the contrary, systematic manipulation of the subject's environment is likely to result in a subject that can be exploited for intelligence information and other national strategic concerns. [<a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/pdf/JPRA-Memo_042409.pdf  >PDF</a>]</blockquote><br /> <br /> So torture can result in the subject being  exploited  for various propaganda and strategic concerns. This memo should be well known but isn't, largely because the two reporters for the <i>Washington Post</i>, Peter Finn and Joby Warrick, <a href= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/24/AR2009042403171.html?hpid=topnews&amp;sid=ST2009042403231  >who wrote about it</a> in 2009  <a href= http://firedoglake.com/2009/04/26/washington-post-helps-jpra-cover-up-complicity-in-torture-program  >managed to avoid the most crucial part of it</a> in their story, as <a href= http://www.truth-out.org/author/itemlist/user/44741  >Jeff Kaye</a>, a psychologist active in the anti-torture movement, has noted. <br /> <br /> One reporter who has highlighted critical issues along these lines is Marcy Wheeler -- noting as the recent report was being released:  <a href= https://www.emptywheel.net/2014/12/08/the-debate-about-torture-were-not-having-exploitation  >The Debate about Torture We're Not Having: Exploitation</a>,  where she writes:  Some other things exploitation is used for -- indeed the very things the torture we reverse-engineered for our own torture program was used for -- are to help recruit double agents and to produce propaganda.  Her reporting also raises questions about how torture was used to push a whole host of policies, which would make us a virtual tortureocracy: CIA director  John Brennan has admitted to using information from the torture program in declarations he wrote for the FISA Court. This means that information derived from torture was used to scare [FISA judge] Colleen Kollar-Kotelly <a href= https://www.emptywheel.net/2014/12/08/some-torture-facts  >into approving the Internet dragnet in 2004</a>.  (Disclosure: Wheeler writes a column for <a href= http://exposefacts.org/  >ExposeFacts.org</a>, a project of the Institute for Public Accuracy, where I work.) <br /> <br /> Many presumed critics of torture have, either intentionally or not, obscured its connection to war making and other agendas. Teju Cole notes in an interview with the <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/12/10/reading-the-times-with-teju-cole/?_r=0  ><i>New York Times</i></a> on Dec. 10 about that outlet:  The paper's fabrications and support for the Iraq war is a generational shame that shouldn't be too quickly forgotten. It should haunt us for a long time.  But his comments on the torture report betray a total lack of understanding of the connection between torture and the invasion of Iraq, ascribing to it the very human emotions of revenge rather than the more Machiavellian realities of policy making:<blockquote> Let's acknowledge torture for what it is: It is punishment, vengeance. It's the kind of havoc you wreak on an enemy or bystander merely because your rage needs an outlet. It has vanishingly little to do with intelligence-gathering. It spreads grief, and though it intends to do so, it spreads even much more than it intends. It destroys the perpetrators too. Rage is not a precision weapon.</blockquote><br /> <br /> But the rage of the general public -- steered in large measure by major media -- might have been useful in increased public acceptance of torture in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, but that's not what makes decisions in the U.S. It's decided by the machinations of a narrow set of elites who act in their interests as the utility of torture shows. The coverups for how war was made have grown so complex that critics like Teju Cole have been sucked into it.<br /> <br /> Researchers for Human Rights Watch <a href= http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/05/11/libyaus-investigate-death-former-cia-prisoner  >have done some good work in getting information on the al-Libi case</a>, but Ken Roth, the head of the group doesn't seem to take to heart the lessons of that case, writing that the CIA  <a href= https://twitter.com/KenRoth/status/542731263472594944  >forgot its own conclusions from 1989: inhumane interrogation was 'counterproductive,' yielded false answers'</a> in reference to a recent <i>New York Times</i> piece:  <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/world/senate-torture-report-shows-cia-infighting-over-interrogation-program.html?contentCollection=world&amp;action=click&amp;module=NextInCollection&amp;region=Footer&amp;pgtype=article  >Report Portrays a Broken C.I.A. Devoted to a Failed Approach</a>.  But it's not that the CIA  forgot -- the torture regime is actually designed to produce false but useful information that can be used to justify hideous polices. Pretending it's a  failed approach  is to exactly avoid telling the truth about the torture program just as everyone is claiming that they are telling the truth about it. <br /> <br /> And there are arguably other utilities of torture for war makers, often portrayed only as costs to the society as a whole: It's profitable to a few. It helps stifle dissent as a method of social control. It was likely especially effective at silencing the Arab and Muslim American community just as the U.S. was gearing up to invade Afghanistan and Iraq. <br /> <br /> The recent report highlights a CIA memo that relayed instructions from the White House to apparently hide the program from then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. Powell could  blow his stack if he were to be briefed on what's going on,  <a href= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/cia-torture-report-set-release-article-1.2038874  >the email said</a>. But when I questioned Powell on the connection between torture and war, he was remarkably defensive. His former chief of staff, Larry Wilkerson wrote in 2009 that the Bush administration's  principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. <a href= https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwashingtonnote.com%2Fthe_truth_about%2F&amp;ei=jg2LVIzvM9CCgwSd1oK4Bg&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-c7s0El8Y0e0K-QvSh1GqEcj5QQ&amp;sig2=51VNihN6wFPf2tkaWNxfQg&amp;bvm=bv.81828268,d.eXY  >but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al-Qaeda</a>.  Shortly after he wrote that, I questioned Colin Powell at the  media stakeout  as he left the CBS studios in DC:<br /> <br /> <blockquote >Sam Husseini: General, can you talk about the al-Libi case and the link between torture and the production of tortured evidence for war?<br /><br /> Colin Powell: I don't have any details on the al-Libi case.<br /><br /> SH: Can you tell us when you learned that some of the evidence that you used in front of the UN was based on torture? When did you learn that?<br /><br /> CP: I don't know that. I don't know what information you're referring to. So I can't answer.<br /><br /> SH: Your chief of staff, Wilkerson, has written about this.<br /><br /> CP: So what? [inaudible]<br /><br /> SH: So you'd think you'd know about it.<br /><br /> CP: The information I presented to the UN was vetted by the CIA. Every word came from the CIA and they stood behind all that information. I don't know that any of them believe that torture was involved. I don't know that in fact. A lot of speculation, particularly by people who never attended any of these meetings, but I'm not aware of it.</blockquote><br /> <br /> But my questioning was based on statements by Wilkerson, who was in the room. Presumably Powell has been waiting for the CIA to call him and tell him directly that torture was used to extract some of the information he used. See my piece  <a href= http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/02/06/how-colin-powell-showed-that-torture-works  >How Colin Powell Showed That Torture Works</a>  and <a href= http://blip.tv/grittv/grittv-washington-stakeout-colin-powell-2173969  >video</a>. <br /> <br /> This problem of torture yielding useful but false information was not unforeseeable. Professor As'ad AbuKhalil appeared on a news release for the Institute for Public Accuracy, where I work, the day after Powell's notorious UN speech:  The Arab media is reporting that the Zakawi story was provided by Jordanian intelligence, which has a <a href= http://www.accuracy.org/release/557-some-analysis-of-powells-speech/  >record of torture and inaccuracy</a>.  Indeed, the utility of torture might also help further explain U.S. government ties to brutal regimes. Part of what the U.S. government derives from them is capacity to torture and kill. As professor Lisa Hajjar has noted, it was the Egyptian  <a href= http://www.accuracy.org/release/egypts-torturer-in-chief-running-for-president/  >Torturer in Chief</a>  Omar Suleiman who got al-Libi to talk about a connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda -- the U.S. torturers in Gitmo had apparently failed. Bob Woodward <a href= http://www.claremont.org/article/strategically-challenged/#.VInDPXW98tM  target= _hplink >quotes</a> former CIA head George Tenet:  We created the Jordanian intelligence service and now we own it.  <br /> <br /> Of course such regimes sometimes fall in an out of favor, there can be little honor among thieves. Al-Libi himself was eventually turned over to Muammar Gaddafi, at a time when -- to the bewilderment of many -- the U.S. government was rather cordial with the former Libyan dictator. In 2009, a newspaper run by one of Gaddafi's son's claimed al-Libi committed suicide in his Libyan jail cell. Juan Cole wrote at the time:  The best refutation of Dick Cheney's insistence that torture was necessary and useful in dealing with threats from al-Qaeda <a href= http://www.juancole.com/2009/05/al-libi-case-eloquent-testimony-against.html  >just died in a Libyan prison</a>.  <br /> <br /> But only if we insist on forgetting this case and the evidence that lies for war and torture are joined at the hip.<br /> <br /> <center>__________________</center><br /> <i>Sam Husseini is communications director for the <a href= http://www.accuracy.org/  >Institute for Public Accuracy</a>.

"Your Money or Your Life"	"There is a Jack Benny routine where a mugger pointed a gun at Jack and said,  Your money or your life.  Jack hesitates. The mugger said,  Look bud, I said your money or your life.  Jack turns to the mugger and said,  I'm thinking it over. <br /> <br /> This scenario is very funny because it is so ridiculous. We all understand our lives are far more important than our money. Yet, when we consider our legacy to our children, grandchildren and the world, our focus often shifts away from our lives, our values and how we make a positive difference in the world to a discussion about passing our money onto future generations.<br /> <br /> Our legacy is not about our money; it is about the lasting impact we make on the people we love and the world around us. Ernest Becker said it best:<br /> <br /> <blockquote>What man really fears is not so much extinction, but extinction with insignificance. Man wants to know that his life has somehow counted... that it has left a trace, a trace that has meaning. And in order for anything once alive to have meaning, its effects must remain alive in eternity in some way.</blockquote><br /> <br /> We want to leave behind a trace that has meaning. That doesn't mean that 150 years from now people will remember your name. The truth is they probably won't. Your great-great-grandparents probably died about 150 years ago. How many of their first names can you recall?<br /> <br /> You may not recall their names, but you may be living their legacy. My family has a long history of entrepreneurship. My father, uncles and grandfathers were all entrepreneurs. I was told as a teenager that it is less risky to work for yourself than to work for someone else. I was told to take business risks while you are young; if it doesn't work out, you have plenty of time to try again. <br /> <br /> Their legacy inspired me to create my first entrepreneurial endeavor. I started my own window washing business in high school. When we were 34 and 31, my brother and I started GV financial advisors. Working together and with our colleagues, we have built a company that allows us to each use our signature talents while making a meaningful difference in the lives of our clients and colleagues.<br /> <br /> My children are 26 and 24. I don't know if either of them will be entrepreneurs. I do hope I have shown them the benefits of taking some risks while you are young, and of building a company that allows you to do what you love.<br /> <br /> Maybe more importantly, I want to leave my children a legacy of confidence and values. I want them to understand that they have the ability to overcome any adversity the future may hold. I want to share with them our family values of working hard, being kind, having a generous heart and contributing to the community. <br /> <br /> I hope that my children will pass on our family values to my grandchildren who hopefully will pass it on to my great-grandchildren. I don't expect my great-grandchildren to remember my name. I do hope they understand the value of being an entrepreneur and living by our family values.<br /> <br /> I want my legacy to include leaving the world a better place than I found it. My wife and I have always believed in the value of a quality education and in the power of community. We give our time, talents and money to a local charity that provides interest-free loans to kids struggling to pay for college. Our hope is the college experience will expose these kids to opportunities to meet new people, learn new ideas and pursue careers that will be both financially and personally rewarding.<br /> <br /> My wife and I don't expect these young adults to remember our names.

"New Changes May Make Getting a Mortgage Easier"	"If you've had past credit problems or can't save up enough to cover a large down payment, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may have just cut you a break when it comes to getting a mortgage.<br /> <br /> Stricter credit score limits, large down payments and even heavy paperwork requirements have kept many would-be borrowers from buying a home in recent years, but new rules put in place by the government-sponsored enterprises may change that.<br /> <br /> The new guidelines, which took effect this week, resulted from an agreement in October that clarifies when lenders would be penalized for making mistakes on mortgages they sell to Fannie and Freddie. Lenders have blamed the lack of clarity for tight credit conditions that have made it difficult for many consumers to qualify for a mortgage, <a href= http://online.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-lenders-set-to-relax-standards-1417197075  rel= nofollow ><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> reported.<br /> <br /> Here's what you need to know.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>Lower Credit Score Requirements</strong></b><br /> <br /> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a 620 credit score approval threshold for conventional loans, but many lenders had said they weren't sure what that limit was. By extension, they said they were hesitant to approve <a href= http://www.realtor.com/advice/can-spouses-credit-score-kill-mortgage/ target= _blank >consumers with subprime credit scores</a>, fearing those applications would be delayed or ultimately denied.<br /> <br /> Under the new rules, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have made their credit score and history requirements more transparent. As a result, lenders are likely to ease up on consumers who have lower credit scores or a black mark on their credit histories from a one-time events such as <a href= http://www.realtor.com/advice/help-lost-job-buying-a-home/ >job loss</a> or a big medical bill.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>Less Paperwork</strong></b><br /> <br /> In the past, many lenders imposed extra requirements--known as credit overlays--on consumers with past credit mistakes. For example, consumers with a past credit mishap would often have to write a letter explaining the mistake before the lender would approve their loan. This situation will definitely change, said Jason van den Brand, mortgage expert and CEO of online home refinancing service Lenda.<br /> <br />  The supplemental stuff that drives everyone nuts will decrease gradually,  van den Brand said.  Like being required to write a letter explaining why their credit was pulled for the loan they're applying for. Hello! It's [being] pulled because they are getting a home loan. That stupid stuff hopefully goes out the window and saves homeowners a bunch of headaches. <br /> <br /> Previously, if you had <a href= http://www.realtor.com/advice/6-smart-tips-securing-mortgage/  >late payments on your credit card or a small unpaid bill</a>, the lender might have been willing to approve you--but also required you to write and submit a letter of explanation for the mishap, adding more paperwork on your end.<br /> <br /> Under the new rules, many lenders may remove or lower the number of credit overlays they include, meaning less paperwork for you.<br /> <br /> <strong>A Possible Change in Processing Times</strong><br /> <br /> In recent years, getting a <a href= http://www.realtor.com/home-finance/get-mortgage-rates.aspx >mortgage</a> could take several weeks or two months. But will those new rules change that? <br /> <br />  Yes, but only slightly, and this is just a stepping stone,  van den Brand said.  You might see a day shaved off the process, but don't expect anything drastic. <br /> <br /> The application process will still be the most time-consuming factor for buyers. However, processing times might speed up if more lenders start going paperless.<br /> <br />  Once technology is enabled to allow folks to get their required documentation faster online, the whole process will really speed up,  he added.  Digital is the answer, and we're much closer to that than most people realize. <br /> <br /> <strong>More Changes in the Works</strong><br /> <br /> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may issue even more changes that benefit consumers in the future. According to <a href= http://www.forbes.com/sites/markgreene/2014/12/01/fannie-and-freddie-make-mortgaging-easier/ ><em>Forbes</em></a>, the enterprises are considering lowering the minimum down payment requirement from 5% to 3% for government-insured conventional loans.<br /> <br /> <strong>What This Means for the Future Market</strong><br /> <br /> The relaxing of credit scores could mean more people buying houses and a <a href= http://www.realtor.com/news/5-housing-market-predictions-2015/ >boost to the market.</a> A study from the Urban Institute published in March found that if credit requirements were relaxed to  normal levels,  about 1.2 million additional home loans per year could have been made.<br /> <br /> And while these new rules may help some buyers get that home, don't expect any overnight miracles for the housing market.<br /> <br />  It's not going to solve the perceived housing problem,  van den Brand noted.

"Best Cash-Back Websites for Earning Money on the Side"	"<a href= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-10-cash_back_websites.jpg ><img alt= 2014-12-10-cash_back_websites.jpg  src= http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-10-cash_back_websites-thumb.jpg  width= 570  height= 427  /></a><br /> <br /> <em>By Morgan Quinn, Feature Writer</em><br />  <br /> Online shoppers can go beyond coupons or price comparison tools to find the best money-saving deals. Cash-back websites are a popular way to earn back a portion of the money you already spend online. Consumers simply register with a cash-back website and start shopping, selecting from a list of the site's preferred merchants. Any time you buy something through the site, you receive a percentage of the sale in the form of cash back or other rewards. Many of these sites also offer rewards for referring family and friends, although they must make at least one purchase in order for you to reap the benefits.<br /> <br /> The savings these cash-back sites offer can vary, depending on which one you use, so it's important to compare the sites and shop through the ones that offer the highest payouts. The internet is littered with cash-back sites and it's difficult to know which ones offer the best rewards, so we've narrowed it down for you.<br /> <br /> In no particular order, here is a list of our favorite cash-back websites.<br /> <br /> <strong><em><a href= http://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/vote-personal-finance-expert-2014-here/  target= _hplink >>>Submit Your Vote for the Best Personal Finance Expert of 2014</a></em></strong><br /> <br /> <h3>1. ShopAtHome.com</h3><br /> <br /> ShopAtHome.com offers up to 70 percent percent cash back from an enormous selection of more than 3,000 online sellers, including Walmart, Bath & Body Works and Kohls. Once you rack up $20 in savings, the site mails you a check.<br /> <br />  ShopAtHome.com is all about saving our members money,  said Marc Braunstein, president and founder.  Not only do we boast more than 120,000 coupons from more than 50,000 stores, but we also offer cash back, exclusive deals and rewards that can be redeemed for free gift cards. <br /> <br /> <h3>2. Ebates.com</h3><br /> <br /> Ebates offers coupon codes for over 1,200 retailers, including Nordstrom and Sephora. Users can also earn up to 25 percent cash back on purchases -- and when you make your first purchase, the site will credit your account an additional $5. Checks are mailed quarterly once your account has reached a balance over $5, or you can request the rebate be donated to charity.<br /> <br />  Just like with almost every other online shopping center, we get a commission from the stores when you make a purchase. Instead of keeping that money -- like almost all other sites do -- we share it with you in the form of a 'Big Fat Check,'  said Mark Moran, senior vice president of marketing and distribution for Ebates.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Keep Reading: <a href= http://www.gobankingrates.com/credit-cards/10-rewards-credit-cards-2014/  target= _hplink >10 Best Rewards Credit Cards of 2014</a></strong></em><br /> <br /> <h3>3.

You can get cash back from hundreds of stores and thousands of store offers, as well as bonuses for referring friends and family members (they have to make at least one purchase). Earnings are paid any time via check or PayPal.<br /> <br />  Using a cash-back browser extension, like FatWallet Express, provides automatic notifications when you search or shop directly at your favorite stores. It's essentially the  easy button  for cash back,  said Brent Shelton at FatWallet.com.<br /> <br /> <h3>4. Swagbucks.com</h3><br /> <br /> Swagbucks.com offers cash-back rewards for more than just online shopping: Users earn a virtual currency called Swag Bucks for a variety of online activities, including searching, shopping, taking surveys, playing games and discovering online content. Members can simply install a search toolbar to make it easy to start earning rewards. Swag Bucks can be redeemed for retail gift cards, PayPal cash and other rewards.<br /> <br />  Cash back and rewards-based shopping is one of the easiest ways to save money while shopping online,  said David Weinrot, COO of Swagbucks.com.  Simply start your shopping at a rewards or cash-back site and receive a percentage of your purchase amount back in the form of cash or the site's rewards currency. We encourage shoppers to also 'stack deals' to get the most benefit, and it's quite simple. Find an online coupon code (we publish them on Swagbucks.com) that offers a dollar off or percent off. Plus, you can easily qualify for free shipping with a minimum purchase amount; and, if you pay with a rewards-based credit card, all of a sudden you will find yourself 'quadruple stacking' your rewards. <br /> <br /> <h3>5. Mypoints.com</h3><br /> <br /> Every time shoppers make a purchase through MyPoints.com they earn rewards points, which can be redeemed for for gift cards, cash back or even travel miles.<br /> <br /> <h3>6. Mrreebates.com</h3><br /> <br /> Mr. Rebates offers cash-back rebates of up to 30 percent on all your online shopping, plus coupons for over 2,000 merchants like Best Buy, Overstock.com and Dell.

Upromise.com</h3><br /> <br /> Upromise.com is a loyalty program where members earn credits on qualifying purchases. Members can shop from grocery stores, online retailers, travel sites, restaurants or gas stations to earn credits, which can be directed to a college savings plan or used to pay down student loans. Members can also request a check payout and are not required to spend their rewards on college-related expenses.<br /> <br /> <h3>8. Befrugal.com</h3><br /> <br /> BeFrugal.com features cash back, online coupons and promotion codes for over 4,000 merchants. The site also offer printable coupons that can be used offline at restaurants and grocery stores. If you make a purchase and then find a higher rate on another site, BeFrugal will apply the higher rate, plus 25 percent, to your rebate. You can cash out your rebates once your account has reached $25.<br /> <br />  You can use BeFrugal.com to find discounts and sales, earn cash back on your online purchases and maximize your shopping dollars,  said Jon Lal, the site's founder.  BeFrugal has coupons available for over 40,000 stores, including all of the top 500, and saves shoppers an average of $27 per order. <br /> <br /> <h3>9. ExtraBux.com</h3><br /> <br /> Find deals using the site's comparison-shopping tool, which allows you to select an item and then compare all the merchants selling that particular item.

You also get a $5 bonus just for signing up, as well as earn additional cash when your friends shop. Earnings are paid by check, Alipay or PayPal once your account has reached at least $10, or you can have the money donated to charity.<br /> <br /> <h3>10. BigCrumbs.com</h3><br /> <br /> BigCrumbs.com offers cash-back rewards for popular retailers like Beauty.com, Barnes & Noble and eBay. Become a BigCrumbs member and start earning cash back just by following the links to your favorite retailers. You can also earn more by referring friends and family to the site. Payouts are toward the end of each month, and you only need a balance of $1 to cash out.<br /> <br />  The smartest thing shoppers can do if they're searching for cash back on the Internet is to find a program they really like and stick with it!  said Vince Martin, CEO of BigCrumbs.com.  Most leading programs pay competitive rates, so small differences here and there tend to average out over time. That's why I'd say the biggest things to look out for when selecting a program are: 1. Reliable tracking, 2. Good customer service that stands behind members (especially when the occasional tracking glitch does occur), 3. Fast payments (for instance, some programs pay monthly vs. quarterly and some have higher minimum payment requirements before they'll send a payment).  "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 15:50:45 -0500"	"money"
"5 Cool and Easy Ways to Donate to Charity"	"One of the foundations of good finances is charitable giving. It might seem counterintuitive that <a href= http://personaldividends.com/reasons-to-give-to-charity/  target= _hplink >giving your money away results in better finances</a> for you, but it's true that giving can provide you with rewards that extend to the personal and the financial. <br /> <br /> From the warm fuzzies you feel when you donate to the <a href= http://www.taxdebthelp.com/blog/5-tips-taking-tax-deduction-charitable-donation  target= _hplink >tax deduction that you might receive</a>, it makes sense to be generous. If you want a few cool and easy ways to donate to charity, here are some ideas that can help you do more -- no matter how much money you have:<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Click to Donate</strong><br /> <br /> One of the coolest ways to support the charity of your choice is <a href= http://www.clicktodonate.org/  target= _hplink >Click to Donate</a>. There are a number of non-profits available for donation, and you can find what you're looking for quickly and easily. Not only that, but you can also download a browser plugin to help you find and donate as a part of your regular online activity. One of the things I like about Click to Donate is that it also helps you find local charities that you might not otherwise know about.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Amazon Smile<br /> </strong><br /> If you're like me, and you shop on Amazon a lot, you can put a portion of your purchases toward charity. <a href= http://smile.amazon.com/  target= _hplink >Amazon Smile</a> is a program that allows you to give, without changing any of your habits. It's true that the amount given is usually relatively small, so you don't want to make this your primary way of giving. However, if you want to do a little extra, using Amazon Smile can be a good choice.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Free Rice</strong><br /> <br /> This has long been one of my favorite ways to feed the hungry. Basically, <a href= http://freerice.com/#/english-vocabulary/1544  target= _hplink >Free Rice</a> is a quiz that donates food for each question that you get right. If you have a few minutes, you can answer questions and build up rice to be donated through the World Food Programme. I love it because you can help feed the hungry around the world, while at the same time learning something, since all of the questions have to do with word definitions. So, keep your brain sharp while helping others.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. Donate Credit Card Rewards</strong><br /> <br /> One of the coolest ways to donate to charity is to donate your credit cards rewards. If you have unused points or miles, you can usually <a href= http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/how-to-donate-unused-rewards-miles-points-1263.php  target= _hplink >donate them to charity</a>. Most credit card issuers allow you to do this, and some even have programs that will boost your gift. Check into the terms and conditions to see how you can make this donation. It's a good way to help others without breaking the bank.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Charity Miles</strong><br /> <br /> Want to get in shape while you donate to charity? A cool app called <a href= http://www.charitymiles.org/  target= _hplink >Charity Miles</a> will help you earn for charity when you walk, bike or run. All you have to do is follow your regular routine, and what you do will help others. You don't have to break the bank, and it can be a fun way to take your workout to the next level.<br /> <br /> <strong>Things to Remember When Giving to Charity</strong><br /> <br /> It's important to be smart about your charitable giving, however. Remember that many of these cool and easy ways to give (like Amazon Smile or Free Rice) aren't likely to amount to a huge donation. An occasional donation through these sites isn't the same thing as a regular donation of money or time, which is why Click to Donate, or a regular contribution to a charity of your choice (I make automatic monthly donations using my credit card), are more effective in the long run. I like to <a href= http://blog.equifax.com/family-money/prioritize-your-charitable-contributions-this-holiday-season/  target= _hplink >prioritize my main charitable donations</a>, and then use other means to do a little extra good.<br /> <br /> What are your favorite ways to give to charity?

"Obama Hails Budget Compromise, Citing Needed Ebola Funds"	"<br>(Adds quotes)</br>                <br>WASHINGTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama  on Friday hailed a budget compromise that many of his fellow  Democrats opposed, saying it is a product of both sides working  together.</br>                <br> This is by definition a compromise bill,  Obama told  reporters as he met senior aides to discuss the U.S. fight  against the Ebola virus.  This is what's produced when you have  the divided government that the American people voted for. </br>                <br>In the negotiations, Obama found himself at odds with a key  Democratic loyalist in Congress, Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the  Democratic minority in the House of Representatives.</br>                <br>Pelosi wanted pulled out of the legislation a provision that  weakens some of the Wall Street reforms that Obama engineered  after the 2008-09 financial meltdown. While Obama opposed the  Wall Street reform provision as well, he did not actively fight  to get it excluded to avoid disrupting the compromise talks.</br>                <br> There are a couple provisions in this bill that I really do  not like,  Obama said. On the other hand, he said, it includes  funding needed for his signature healthcare law, fighting  climate change, expanding early childhood education and  confronting the Ebola virus.</br>                <br> Had I been able to draft my own legislation, get it passed  without any Republican votes, I suspect it would be slightly  different,  Obama said.  That is not the circumstance we find  ourselves in and I think what the American people very much are  looking for is responsible governance and the willingness to  compromise. </br>                <br>At his daily news briefing, White House spokesman Josh  Earnest sought to mend fences with Pelosi after the strains that  emerged between her and Obama on Thursday. He said none of the  central legislative achievements of the Obama presidency could  have been done without Pelosi's help.</br>                <br> The president is confident that the strong working  relationship and the effective, productive working relationship  that we have had over the last six years will continue for the  next two,  said Earnest, referring to the end of Obama's tenure.</br>                <br>Obama said the $1.01 trillion legislation that passed the  House of Representatives and appeared headed toward approval by  the Senate contains funds necessary for the fight against Ebola.</br>                <br> We've got to stay on this,  he said of the Ebola outbreak  in West Africa.  This is not a fight that is going to go away  any time soon.      (Reporting By Steve Holland)</br> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 14:22:00 -0500"	"money"

That is, the rise of finance was a money grab by the 1 percent.<br /> <br /> <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.salon.com/2014/11/30/how_to_deal_with_wall_street_and_income_inequality_in_one_fell_swoop/salonfinance2/  rel= attachment wp-att-13831854 ><img class= size-full wp-image-13831854 alignnone  title= SalonFinance2  src= http://media.salon.com/2014/11/SalonFinance2.jpg  alt=   width= 559  height= 334  /></a><br /> <br /> Because relatively few low-income and middle-income families own financial assets, they largely haven't benefited from the rise of finance. Instead, it's enriched the wealthy while saddling the middle class with debt.

HFT is a useless and distortionary practice that allows investors to make money off of millisecond-quick trades. (HFT recently attracted attention in Michael Lewis' book  Flash Boys. ) The practice <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/news/conferences/14fmc/Stiglitz.pdf >has been derided</a> by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz as a sophisticated version of front-running (buying a stock shortly before a pending order to take advantage of the price increase).<br /> <br /> The problem is that instead of channeling money toward profitable investment, HFT is a prime example of making money off of moving money around. A recent study <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/business/24trading.html?_r=3&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss >finds</a> that a one millisecond advantage can increase a firm's earnings by $100 million a year. Ironically, while bridges are <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/thousands-of-us-bridges-vulnerable-to-collapse/ >vulnerable to collapse</a> across the country and infrastructure in general is sorely undercapitalized, high-speed traders <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.wired.com/2012/08/ff_wallstreet_trading/all/ >spent</a> $2 billion on infrastructure in 2010 -- for high-speed cables to NYSE. HFT does nothing to benefit markets, but instead makes them more volatile.<strong> </strong><br /> <br /> <strong>The solution: A Financial Transaction Tax</strong><br /> <br /> When an industry has negative impacts on the broader public, economists call these effects  externalities.  It doesn't mean we should destroy the industry, but rather, limit the harmful behavior. In much the same way that we should tax carbon dioxide -- and do tax cigarettes and alcohol -- we should also tax financial transactions.<br /> <br /> The idea for a financial transaction tax has been around since John Maynard Keynes'  General Theory.<em>  </em>However, <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://ideas.repec.org/p/cwl/cwldpp/506.html >the idea began to gain traction</a> in the late '70s and '80s with the rapid growth of the financial sector. In 1989, Lawrence Summers and Victoria Summers <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://stevereads.com/papers_to_read/when_financial_markets_work_too_well.pdf >proposed</a> a U.S. Securities Transfer Excise Tax, arguing that it could raise some $10 billion annually. Recently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has<a style= color: #ff0000;  href= https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11185.pdf >supported</a> a financial transaction tax as well. A <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= https://ideas.repec.org/p/sus/susewp/1611.html >metastudy</a> by Neil McCulloch and Grazia Pacillo finds that a Tobin Tax (a type of FTT) would be  feasible and, if appropriately designed, could make a significant contribution to revenue without causing major distortions. <br /> <br /> From 1914 to 1966, the United States levied a 0.02 percent tax on sales and transfers of stock. Federally, Speaker Jim Wright pushed for a renewed tax in 1987, proposing a fee of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent on the buyer and seller of each securities transaction, highlighting the tax's progressive aspects. More recently, the  Wall Street Trading and Speculators Tax Act  was proposed by Sens. Harkin and DeFazio, which would assess a tax of 0.03 percent on trades of stocks, bonds, futures, options, swaps and credit-default swaps, and would <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://defazio.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/memo-joint-tax-committee-finds-harkin-defazio-wall-street-trading-and >generate $352 billion over 10 years</a>.<br /> <br /> Such a tax would not be unprecedented. On May 6, 2014, 10 European nations issued a<a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/business/international/european-financial-trading-tax-moves-forward-despite-new-pockets-of-resistance.html >joint statement</a> that a financial tax will begin in 2016 as a means to reduce speculation and raise revenue. The initial tax will focus on the trading of stocks and some derivatives, even though the initial proposal included taxing most financial products. The European Commission <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/com_2013_71_en.pdf >estimates</a> that a broad tax could raise $39 billion (31 billion EUR) in annual revenues.<br /> <br /> Further, there was a Stock Transfer Tax (a type of FTT) in place in New York from 1905 to 1981; revenue from the tax was split between the city and state (in the 1960s the full revenue reverted entirely to New York City). Because of a quirk in its phase-out, the STT remains technically legal in New York, though it is automatically rebated to the trader at a rate of 100 percent. Reducing <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://www.thenation.com/article/188505/why-cuomo-leaving-wall-street-cash-table >this rebate</a> would be a great way to boost revenues for New York and show the viability of a more expansive tax.<br /> <br /> Finance is an important part of any economy. But the unprecedented rise of finance has <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://theweek.com/article/index/258640/how-wall-street-is-crushing-main-street >harmed the real economy</a>, propelled inequality and <a style= color: #ff0000;  href= http://qz.com/196575/to-get-rich-forget-entrepreneurship-and-marry-wealthy/ >created opportunities for rent-seeking</a>. To rein in Wall Street and prevent another financial crisis, and to give governments much needed money to invest, we should levy a modest tax on financial transactions. Right now, the financial industry subsists on monetizing privilege. It needs to shrink so we can grow.<br /> <br /> This article originally appeared on <em><a href= http://www.salon.com/2014/11/30/how_to_deal_with_wall_street_and_income_inequality_in_one_fell_swoop/ >Salon</a>. </em><br /> <br /> </div> "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 14:12:02 -0500"	"money"
"Government Goes After Student Loan Assistance Companies"	"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has taken action against some student loan assistance companies that are selling programs to consumers saying they can offer great benefits to those with student loans.<br /> <br /> The CFPB went so far as to say they  took action to put an end to two student  debt relief  scams that illegally tricked borrowers into paying upfront fees for federal loan benefits. <br /> <br /> The two companies in the crosshairs have passed over my keyboard before. Both <a href= https://getoutofdebt.org/tag/student-loan-processing >Student Loan Process.US</a> and <a href= https://getoutofdebt.org/50057/help-student-loan-default-review-are-they-a-scam >College Education Services</a> raised concerns for me early on and had been the target of other reports as well.<br /> <br /> Back in February of 2013 I wrote <a href= https://getoutofdebt.org/49243/student-loan-assistance-rescue-scams-on-the-rise-beware >this article</a> warning consumers about dubious student loan assistance outfits. The tea leaves were very clear on what was about to happen to consumers. It seemed the sales outfits that had been pushing debt settlement had moved on to now target those with student loans. It is/was almost like shooting fish in a barrel.<br /> <br /> And ironically, it was the very government loan servicers that were driving consumers into the hands of scammers by not knowing what programs were in their quivers or being properly incentivized to offer them.<br /> <br /> Rohit Chopra of the CFPB said,  We have previously noted that problems in student loan servicing can create the opportunity for scammers to flourish -- similar to the  foreclosure rescue  scams that grew in number as homeowners struggled with their mortgage servicers. <br /> <br /> And with the recent action against those two companies the CFPB says they are  issuing a consumer advisory today warning student loan borrowers to be wary of paying high fees for free federal loan benefits. <br /> <br />  Student loans are already a significant debt for many Americans. College Education Services and Student Loan Processing.US added to that hardship by taking advantage of troubled borrowers and failing to describe their services honestly,  said CFPB Director Richard Cordray.  When scam artists prey on student loan borrowers, we will take action to halt their illegal activity. <br /> <br /> <strong>College Education Services Banned from Industry</strong><br /> <br /> College Education Services, its owner, Marcia Elena Vargas, and advisor and employee, Frank Liz, marketed and advertised debt relief services to student loan borrowers with loans in default. Based in Tampa, Florida, the company advertised through Internet ads and operated websites including CollegeDefaultedStudentLoan.com and HelpStudentLoanDefault.com. The company reaped millions of dollars in advance fees from thousands of consumers before it ceased operations around February 2013. Specifically, College Education Services:<br /> <ul><br /> <li><strong>Charged illegal advance fees:</strong> Federal law requires at least one debt to be renegotiated, settled, or reduced before a fee can be collected for debt relief services. But College Education Services charged consumers between $195 and $2,500 and required all, or a substantial portion, of its fees to be paid upfront; the average fee was about $500. The company even took money from financially distressed consumers who could not qualify for loan consolidation, income-driven payment plans, or loan forgiveness programs.</li><br /> <li><strong>Falsely promised lower payments:</strong> Presenting themselves as  counselors,  College Education Services' telemarketers promised consumers that they could solve all the student loan issues that plagued consumers. Internet ads and telemarketers guaranteed lower monthly payments for consumers. One College Education Services' ad said,  Cut Your Student Loan Monthly Payment Up to 50% - Save Today!  The company often failed to deliver the promised results. For some consumers who qualified for loan consolidation, College Education Services selected monthly repayment plans that increased their monthly payments.</li><br /> <li><strong>Falsely claimed quick relief from default or garnishment:</strong> The company promised quick relief from default or garnishment. Garnishment is when a court order allows money to be taken from a consumer's salary, bank account, or other asset when she owes money. But the principal debt relief approach the company used - loan consolidation − did not and could not ensure those benefits in all cases, and not in the quick timeframe the company promised. - <a href= http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-to-end-student-debt-relief-scams/ >Source</a></li><br /> </ul><br /> <br /> College Education Services entered into a <a href= http://www.consumerfinance.gov/f/201412_cfpb_consent-order_the-college-education-services.pdf >consent order</a> with the CFPB. This agreement bans Vargas and Liz from  (1) offering, marketing, selling, or providing any Debt-Relief Service, whether directly or indirectly, (2) assisting any person offering, marketing, selling, or providing any Debt-Relief Service, including by consulting, brokering, planning, investing, or advising, and (3) receiving any monies or consideration from, holding any ownership interest in, providing services to, or working in any capacity for any person engaged in or assisting in the offering, marketing, selling, or providing of any Debt-Relief Service. <br /> <br /> The CFPB also took action against what I think was the larger player in this announcement, Student Loan Processing.US.<br /> <br /> <strong>Student Loan Processing.US Sued As Well</strong><br /> <br /> Student Loan Processing.US, a fictitious business name of Irvine Web Works, Inc., is headquartered in Laguna Nigel, California, with an office in Dallas, Texas. The CFPB alleges that since at least July 2011, the company and its owner, James Krause, has been marketing and advertising services to advise and assist borrowers applying for Department of Education federal student loan repayment programs. The company operates websites under the names StudentLoanProcessing.us, StudentLoanProcessing.org, and slpus.org. In the complaint filed today, the Bureau is accusing the company and Krause of:<br /> <br /> <ul><br /> <li><strong>Falsely representing an affiliation with the U.S. Department of Education:</strong> Claiming to be a  consultation service,  Student Loan Processing.US implies to consumers that it is affiliated with the Department of Education. The company uses a logo that resembles a government seal, stamps  Official Business  on its mail to consumers, and cites federal law prohibiting mail tampering to create the impression that the marketing material is sent or endorsed by the federal government.</li><br /> <li><strong>Charging illegal advance fees:</strong> Student Loan Processing.US charges consumers considerable upfront enrollment fees of either 1 percent of the consumer's federal student loan balance or $250, whichever is higher. The company requires payment of the entire fee before it even mails application materials to consumers.</li><br /> <li><strong>Deceiving borrowers about the costs and terms of its services:</strong> Student Loan Processing.US fails to clearly explain and disclose that it charges a monthly service fee that continues until the consumer's federal student loans are paid in full or discharged, a timeframe that could last decades. In certain cases, the company advises consumers who may qualify for zero payments to pay $39 a month - without adequately explaining that the $39 is going to Student Loan Processing.US as a fee.</li><br /> </ul><br /> <br /> The folks behind Student Loan Processing did not enter a consent order with the CFPB and are headed down the long road towards a trial.<br /> <br /> The <a href= https://getoutofdebt.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/201412_cfpb_complaint_student-loan-processing.pdf >complaint the CFPB filed</a> let's us know the CFPB alleges:<br /> <ul><br /> <li> Defendant James Krause is the founder, president, and sole owner of Student Loan Processing.US. Krause has substantial managerial responsibility for and daily control over the operations of Student Loan Processing.US, including sales, onboarding, training, communications, compliance, as well as Student Loan<br /> Processing.US's policies and procedures. </li><br /> <li> Consumers who contacted Defendants in response to an outbound call, the Defendants' mailer, or any other recruitment channel spoke with a self-proclaimed  Student Loan Specialist  for enrollment with Student Loan Processing.US.<br /> <br /> The enrollment calls typically began with staff at Student Loan Processing.US telling the consumer that they were  prequalified  for certain federal student loan repayment and forgiveness programs. During the call, the  specialists  directed the consumer to divulge their confidential 4-digit PIN information for the U.S. Department of Education's National Student Loan Data System, collected information about the borrower's federal student loan balances and annual income, and then quoted the new expected federal student loan monthly payment amount for borrowers who enroll.<br /> <br /> Defendants then gathered banking information from the borrower for payment of the enrollment fee, which was generally collected from the consumer's debit/credit card or bank account during the initial enrollment call. If a consumer needed to schedule payment of the enrollment fee or to break the enrollment fee into more than one payment, Defendants' employees were directed to ask the consumer about the frequency with which they were paid, as well as their next expected payday, in order to schedule the enrollment fee payment around that date. </li><br /> <br /> <li> Throughout the relevant time period, Defendants misrepresented to consumers, directly or by implication, that they were agents of the U.S. Department of Education or were affiliated with that agency in some capacity. </li><br /> <br /> <li> Until approximately September 2012, the logo for Student Loan Processing.US (image on the left below) shared several similarities with the U.S. Department of Education seal (image on the right below), including the outer spherical gold border, inner spherical gold border, tree  growing  from a base, and medium blue shading between the borders with white text. <br /> <br /> <img src= https://getoutofdebt.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Student-Loan-Processing-Logo.jpg  alt= Student Loan Processing Logo  width= 712  height= 294  class= aligncenter size-full wp-image-63215  /></li><br /> <br /> <li> For at least some consumers whose financial circumstances could potentially qualify them for a $0 monthly payment, Defendants regularly advised those consumers that Student Loan Processing.US could get that consumer's monthly payment amount  down to $39,  without separately explaining that the entire $39 payment would be paid to Defendants as a monthly fee, rather than payment toward the consumer's federal student loans. These types of statements, as well as those described in the preceding paragraphs, were made before a consumer consented to payment, as well as during the actual enrollment (when payment was made). </li></ul><br /> <br /> For more help with student loan issues, read <a href= https://getoutofdebt.org/51013/the-ultimate-guide-to-dealing-with-student-loans-you-cant-afford  target= _hplink ><strong>The Ultimate Guide to Dealing With Student Loans You Can't Afford</strong></a> and learn what you can do for yourself, for free.<br /> <br /> <img src= http://getoutofdebt.org/img/Steve-Sig.gif  width= 100  height= 46  title= Steve  Rhode - Consumer Debt Expert  alt= Steve  Rhode - Consumer Debt Expert  /></br><br /> Get Out of Debt Guy - <a href= http://twitter.com/GetOutOfDebtGuy  target= _hplink >Twitter</a>, <a href= https://plus.google.com/114824422459050954723?rel=author  target= _hplink >G+</a>, <a href= http://www.facebook.com/GetOutOfDebtGuy  target= _hplink >Facebook</a><br /> <br /> If you have a credit or debt question you'd like to ask, <a href= http://getoutofdebt.org/ask-the-hp-get-out-of-debt-guy  target= _hplink >just click here and ask away</a>.<br /> <br /> If you'd like to stay posted on all the latest get out of debt news and scam alerts, <a href= http://eepurl.com/doVqD  target= _hplink >subscribe to my free newsletter</a>.<br /> <br /> <link rel= canonical  href= http://getoutofdebt.org/63213/government-goes-student-loan-assistance-companies ><meta name= syndication-source  content= http://getoutofdebt.org/63213/government-goes-student-loan-assistance-companies > "	"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 11:35:49 -0500"	"money"
"Hurry Up! Big Obamacare Deadline Coming Monday"	"The first <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/14/obamacare-enrollment-2015_n_6155354.html  target= _hplink >Obamacare enrollment </a>deadline for next year is just three days away, meaning Monday is the last day for people in most states who buy their own health insurance to choose a plan they can begin using Jan. 1.<br /> <br /> If you're already a customer of a plan selected from a health insurance exchange marketplace or directly from an insurance provider, or if you're uninsured now and looking for coverage for the beginning of the year, there's no more time to waste. Here's are some don't's and do's that last-minute health insurance consumers should consider before the deadline in your home states.<br /> <br />  Don't wait until Sunday. Don't wait until Monday after work,  said DeAnn Friedholm, the health care reform campaign director at Consumers Union.  It is complicated. <br /> <br /> <strong>Don't delay!</strong><br /> <br /> If you're one of these people and don't visit <a href= https://www.healthcare.gov/  target= _hplink >HealthCare.gov</a> or your <a href= https://www.healthcare.gov/get-coverage/  target= _hplink >state's exchange</a>, you won't be able to get a new plan until February, and <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/14/obamacare-enrollment-2015_n_6155354.html  target= _hplink >the last chance to choose a plan for any part of next year is Feb. 15</a> (<a href= https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/special-enrollment-period/  target= _hplink >except under special circumstances</a>). Five state's exchanges have different deadlines: Dec. 18 in <a href= https://www.marylandhealthconnection.gov/  target= _hplink >Maryland</a> and Dec. 23 in <a href= https://www.yourhealthidaho.org/  target= _hplink >Idaho</a>, <a href= https://www.mahealthconnector.org/  target= _hplink >Massachusetts</a>, <a href= http://www.healthsourceri.com/  target= _hplink >Rhode Island</a> and <a href= https://www.wahealthplanfinder.org/  target= _hplink >Washington state</a>. These deadlines only apply to people who buy health insurance through an exchange, a broker or directly from an insurer -- not those who get health benefits from their jobs or a government program like Medicare or Medicaid. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of factors to consider, like what doctors and hospitals you can access, what drugs and medical services are covered, how much you'll have to pay out of pocket when you get health care, and what the monthly premium is. Sorry -- there will be some math.<br /> <br /> To prepare, you should have some information and documentation handy, like your family members' Social Security numbers and last year's tax returns or something else to verify your income, which is how subsidies are calculated. <br /> <br /> <strong>Don't Stand Pat!</strong><br /> <br /> Maybe you got a really good deal on the health insurance you have now, and you like it, <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/upshot/why-most-people-wont-shop-again-for-health-insurance.html  target= _hplink >so you figure you're all set</a>. While it's true that the health insurance exchanges in most states (check with the exchange to find out about where you live) will automatically roll you into the same plan for next year if it's still available, there are a lot of good reasons shop around.<br /> <br />  Don't assume because you have something from last year that it's still the best value for you,  Friedholm said.  There are real savings here to be had for many, many people.  The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that <a href= http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2015/premiumReport/healthPremium2015.pdf  target= _hplink >more than 70 percent of current Obamacare enrollees could save money</a> next year by switching to a new plan with a similar level of coverage.<br /> <br /> Monthly premiums for exchange policies are <a href= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/health-industries/health-research-institute/aca-state-exchanges.jhtml  target= _hplink >going up and down all over the place</a> and<a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/23/obamacare-competition_n_5869710.html  target= _hplink > there are new plans on the marketplaces</a>. It's smart to check whether you can find something more affordable. <br /> <br /> Don't assume you don't qualify for financial assistance: 85 percent of this year's Obamacare enrollees did, and tax credits are available to people who earn up to four times the federal poverty level, or <a href= http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3190  target= _hplink >about $94,000 for a family of four</a>. <br />  <br /> For those who get subsidies, shopping is crucial because of the complicated way the tax credits are calculated. The value of the subsidy is linked to the cost of the so-called benchmark plan in every geographic area, and <a href= http://kff.org/health-reform/slide/change-in-benchmark-silver-premiums-2014-2015/  target= _hplink >those prices went down</a> in many places. These lower premiums mean smaller subsidies. Even if the sticker price for your current plan isn't going up much, you could end up paying much more by not finding a less expensive alternative because your tax credits will be worth less. (Read a more detailed explanation <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/13/obamacare-prices_n_6149076.html  target= _hplink >here</a>.) <br /> <br /> If you are automatically renewed into your existing plan and get a scary bill for January, you can switch to something else for the rest of the year, but you're stuck with that plan for at least a month (unless you cancel it outright and go without coverage).<br /> <br /> It's also vital to visit HealthCare.gov or a state exchange to update your household's income information. If you expect your income to rise and you and don't notify the exchange, you may have to pay back part of your subsidy.<br /> <br /> <strong>Do Your Research!</strong><br /> <br /> The plan you have now may have changed in ways other than price. Your doctor or hospital may not be in the network anymore, or may be available through a different plan. The amount you pay when you get health care may be different, as might the services the policy covers. The journalism nonprofit ProPublica created a useful tool that helps you compare benefits in this year's insurance plans with next year's. Find it <a href= http://projects.propublica.org/aca-enrollment/  target= _hplink >here</a>.<br /> <br /> The trickiest thing about choosing insurance is finding a balance between a decent monthly premium while not exposing yourself to out-of-pocket costs like <a href= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/29/employee-health-benefits_n_5839022.html  target= _hplink >deductibles and copayments you can't afford</a>. For example, if you know you'll have frequent or big-ticket health care needs next year, it may make sense to pay a higher monthly premium so your out-of-pocket costs are lower, Friedholm said.<br /> <br /> <strong>Do Ask For Help!</strong><br /> <br /> To get information about the basics, like what health insurance jargon means or what factors you should consider when choosing a plan, try the <a href= https://www.healthlawhelper.org/  target= _hplink >Consumer Reports Health Law Helper</a>.

"Students Are Not Customers"	"The public schools have long been ideological battlegrounds. Ideologues are seldom content to grind their axes quietly and unobtrusively. If creationism were practiced only among consenting adults, then it might be worthy of the occasional snort or giggle, but for the most part it could just be ignored. However, creationists have tried many times to insert their tenets into the science curricula of public schools. I used to have a cartoon posted on my office door that showed a thick volume titled <em>Texas Science Textbook: King James Version. </em><br />  <br /> The courts have largely stymied the creationists, but the ideological armies march on. Here in Texas, where election to the State Board of Education turns more on purity of creed than academic qualifications, students get the Fox News version of social studies. Textbooks are required to tout  American Exceptionalism,  and the glories of the free market. Among the surprising  facts  that Texas students learn is that Mosaic law laid the basis for the American Constitution, that the Civil War was not chiefly about slavery (which might not have been so terribly bad after all), and that, by golly, ol' Joe McCarthy really did find some commies lurking in the federal government. <br />  <br /> Now the ideologues have set their sights on higher education. Their approach is much subtler here. They do not aim so much to impose a curriculum (though the Koch brothers have made a stab in this direction). Their aim is far more fundamental and insidious. Their goal is nothing less than the destruction of the ancient and venerable academic culture. <br /> <br /> The culture of academe is the product of a historical development that began with the founding of Plato's Academy 2400 years ago. This academic culture recognizes the essential role of research and the necessity of protecting the intellectual independence of researchers by the institution of tenure. Legitimate research cannot be accomplished if researchers are required to toe a doctrinal line or avoid offending the powers-that-be. As Socrates asserted long ago, researchers must be free to follow the argument wherever it leads, even if it leads to conclusions that politicians and administrators do not like.<br /> <br /> Academics further recognize that, far from being opposed, research and teaching are complementary. Research brings fresh ideas, new perspectives, and deeper insights, and the most effective teachers are those who enliven their instruction with the stimulus of fresh thinking. Conversely, though this is less often recognized, the skills developed by teaching are also helpful to researchers. Teaching students demands a rigorous clarity of thought that can communicate the essence of a concept without oversimplifying. Such clarity is a helpful correction to the academic occupational hazard of letting jargon substitute for thinking. <br /> <br /> Ideologues of the right, with increasing support from politicians, and even from some university administrators, now want to impose a  business model  on academe. On this model, students are customers, and universities are in the business of manufacturing degrees. If universities are businesses, then the main function of a professor is to generate income. To that end, professors should teach more and larger courses. They should teach few specialized courses for small groups of advanced students. Rather, they should mostly teach big courses and their salaries and promotions should turn largely on how many butts are in the seats in their classrooms. If professors are to teach more and larger classes, then, obviously, there will be less or no time for research. However, proponents of the business model disparage most academic research. Unless research generates grant money, it is to be discouraged. <br /> <br /> If professors don't like these changes, you get rid of them! In fact, this process is already well underway. Nationwide, full-time, i.e. tenured or tenure-track, professors are being replaced by adjuncts who receive low pay, no benefits, and have no job security. Conservatives have long despised academics because scholarly research refuses to line up behind right-wing hobby horses. For instance, academic research debunks right-wing views on evolution, climate change, supply-side economics,  reparative therapy  for gay people, and abstinence-only sex education. The real nemesis of conservative ideology is objective reality. As Jon Stewart puts it, the facts have a liberal bias. So, the academic researcher is disparaged and despised for dumping the cold water of reason onto the wishful thinking of conservatives. <br /> <br /> So, what is wrong with the  business model  for higher education? Business models are great -- for businesses. However, educating human beings is not like manufacturing and marketing widgets. For one thing, students are not customers. The customer is always right, but the student is not always right. The professor, like a medical doctor, has the responsibility of telling people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Further, unlike selling widgets, success in education simply cannot be quantified in terms of moving so many units in a given time. A degree is not a tangible thing; it is a symbol, a symbol of the attainment of a certain level of skill and knowledge. Viewing a degree as simply a marketed product makes the symbol more important than what it supposedly symbolizes. You are no longer educating. You are selling credentials. <br /> <br /> Real conservatism -- the conservatism of Edmund Burke, not the incoherent mess that now goes by that name -- can be summarized by the slogan  If it isn't broken, don't fix it.  Public higher education in our society is not yet broken, but it soon will be if the ideologues and the politicians keep  fixing  it their way. "	"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 22:52:53 -0500"	"money"
"5 Reasons Housing May Be Headed for Trouble"	"<p>The housing market has been on a roll recently, with some markets even recovering to their peak 2006 levels. That sounds good, until you remember what 2006 was like. In retrospect, it seems clear that those prices were overly inflated by a boom mentality. Can the same be said for the housing market now?</p><br /> <p>So far, home prices have been rising at a more measured pace than they were back in the frenzy of the housing boom. Still, there are at least five reasons to be cautious about the housing market.</p><br /> <p><strong>1. The Fed is no longer keeping mortgage rates down</strong></p><br /> <p>Quantitative easing is over. While the <a href= http://www.money-rates.com/fed.htm >Federal Reserve</a> is still keeping short-term interest rates near zero, it has discontinued the monthly bond purchases that were designed to push longer-term rates down. This was an important influence in getting <a href= http://www.money-rates.com/mortgage.htm >mortgage rates</a> to record lows.</p><br /> <p>So far, mortgage rates have been surprisingly stable, but without the Fed actively keeping them lower, there is no reason why normal market forces could not quickly send them higher -- especially if there is a whiff of inflation somewhere along the line.</p><br /> <p><strong>2. Prices have been rising for more than two years now</strong></p><br /> <p>According to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, the housing market bottomed out in February 2012 and has been rising ever since. The good news is that prices still are not as high as they were in 2006, nor has the rise been as steep. However, the closer prices get to those levels, the more you have to ask what would make them sustainable now if they were not sustainable then.</p><br /> <p><strong>3. Some loan limitations are being softened</strong></p><br /> <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency recently announced that it would allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to back mortgages with down payments as low as 3 percent.</p><br /> <p>After the epidemic of irresponsible lending that went on during the housing boom, the government tightened loan standards. Higher down payment requirements made sure borrowers were more fit to meet their obligations, and would not be as exposed to fluctuations in home prices. By facilitating more low-down payment loans, the government is backing away from these cautionary measures.</p><br /> <p><strong>4. A key banking safeguard has been eroded</strong></p><br /> <p>Separately, federal regulators also announced they were easing a requirement that banks had to keep at least a 5 percent stake in mortgage loans they made. Risk retention requirements made sure banks had an incentive to make responsible loans. By letting banks completely sell off the risk in the form of securities, banks can free themselves of any ongoing responsibility for the loans they make.</p><br /> <p><strong>5. Default rates are creeping back up</strong></p><br /> <p>Mortgage defaults have slowed considerably over the past five years, but most recently they have risen for three straight months. They are still low, and it is too early to tell whether this change is a temporary blip or a true turning point. However, this is a trend worth watching.</p><br /> <p>The best way you can protect yourself from a setback in the housing market is to base your purchase decisions on what your income can readily afford, and not on the assumption that prices will keep rising. After all, buying a home means putting a roof over your head, and that should not be a speculative investment.</p><br /> <p><strong>Also by Richard Barrington:</strong></p><br /> <ul><br /> <li><a href= http://www.money-rates.com/advancedstrategies/mortgage/when-to-bet-house-refinancing.htm >When it makes sense to bet the house</a></li><br /> <li><a href= http://www.money-rates.com/ask-the-expert/pay-down-mortgage-or-build-savings.htm >Pay down my mortgage or build savings?</a></li><br /> <li><a href= http://www.money-rates.com/research-center/interest-rate-forecast-2014.htm >Where will interest rates go in 2014?</a></li><br /> </ul> "	"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 19:57:00 -0500"	"money"
